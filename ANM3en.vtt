00:01.170 --> 00:04.040
A ghost haunts the Yagi house at night?

00:04.040 --> 00:05.720
Don't talk nonsense.

00:11.980 --> 00:13.720
Nagakura-san.

00:14.460 --> 00:16.370
The ghost!

00:19.460 --> 00:21.520
Bedhead begone.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.370
Th-Thank you, Kondo-san.

00:24.660 --> 00:28.520
Now I just need to shake it dry 
and run my hands through it.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.640
What are you, a horse?!

00:33.770 --> 00:36.800
Including myself, 
the Miburo are 15 men strong now.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.800
I've just about got their names and faces down.

00:45.230 --> 00:46.830
Huh? A kid?

00:47.920 --> 00:50.770
Good morning! Did you have a good night's sleep?

00:50.770 --> 00:52.270
<i>Huh? Who's this?</i>

00:52.860 --> 00:55.760
Y-Yes, I did.

00:56.860 --> 01:01.290
My name's Chirinu Nio. I joined 
the Miburo the day before yesterday.

01:01.790 --> 01:04.120
I am called Tanaka Taro.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.670
Like you, I belong to the Miburo.

01:07.870 --> 01:09.670
You do? How old are you?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.110
I count myself 13.

01:12.110 --> 01:14.320
Really? I'm 13, too.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.880
But wait, that's weird.

01:17.260 --> 01:20.140
I made the rounds last night 
to learn everyone's faces,

01:20.510 --> 01:22.560
but I didn't see you anywhere.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.240
Oh, that's because...

01:24.810 --> 01:26.720
I sleep in a closet.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.850
Why?!

01:27.850 --> 01:28.590
Nio!

01:29.880 --> 01:32.120
Morning training time. What are you doing?

01:32.440 --> 01:35.760
Oh, Hijikata-san. 
I was just asking Taro-kun about...

01:36.480 --> 01:37.440
H-Huh?

01:41.150 --> 01:45.160
That's the boy you were wondering about.
Our first wolf from Kyoto.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.450
He is? Then...

01:47.860 --> 01:49.830
Give Taro a wide berth.

01:50.190 --> 01:52.080
Huh? Why, sir?

01:52.480 --> 01:53.830
Never mind why.

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:13.240 --> 02:18.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

03:37.580 --> 03:38.720
Working hard, I see.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.370
Mind if I try?

03:45.770 --> 03:47.920
When you chop wood, stick the axe in,

03:48.680 --> 03:50.010
then just swing down.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.620
See? You get a cleaner split that way.

03:55.030 --> 03:56.160
You're right.

03:56.420 --> 03:57.930
Okay, then. I'll do the rest.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.040
No, you've done enough!

04:00.040 --> 04:02.600
Don't worry. I have time on my hands.

04:03.820 --> 04:06.090
That's enough! Please, stop!

04:07.560 --> 04:08.980
S-Sorry.

04:19.550 --> 04:23.240
Wh-Why did you join the Miburo, Taro-kun?

04:23.920 --> 04:27.240
Because I can't live anywhere else.

04:27.650 --> 04:28.160
Huh?

04:31.030 --> 04:38.370
Oh, I wanted to help everyone protect Kyoto
 and make the world a better place.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.010
What a load of naïve crap.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.020
Huh?

04:50.860 --> 04:51.830
If you'll excuse me.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.280
I saw everything.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.860
O-Okita-san!

05:01.310 --> 05:05.860
Didn't Hijikata-san warn you 
to steer clear of Taro-kun?

05:06.320 --> 05:08.860
P-Please don't tell him.

05:09.180 --> 05:11.250
Hm, I don't know.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.870
But I <i>would</i> like more dango from Chirinuya.

05:20.180 --> 05:26.030
Serizawa-san found Taro-kun who-knows-where 
the same day we got to Kyoto.

05:26.240 --> 05:30.080
Serizawa-san? That funny guy 
from the sumo match?

05:30.910 --> 05:32.030
That's him.

05:32.470 --> 05:36.360
He can be funny, but he also has a wild side.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.950
He's always punching and kicking Taro-kun.

05:40.950 --> 05:41.990
That's awful.

05:41.990 --> 05:45.770
But Taro-kun seems to like it that way.

05:46.310 --> 05:46.880
Huh?

05:48.120 --> 05:53.040
Hijikata-san told you to avoid Taro-kun 
because he's worried about you.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.170
I see.

05:58.470 --> 05:59.760
Is something wrong?

06:00.250 --> 06:01.040
No.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.680
I just wanted to talk with Taro-kun a bit more.

06:04.580 --> 06:07.300
I'd like to know more about him.

06:08.240 --> 06:14.940
Oh-ho. Sounds to me like 
you want to be friends with him.

06:16.010 --> 06:17.890
Friends?

06:18.560 --> 06:20.550
What kind of relationship is that?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.710
Good question.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.320
Take my hand.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.640
Y-Your hand?

06:34.210 --> 06:36.080
Close your eyes.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.380
M-My eyes?

06:38.680 --> 06:40.940
Whatever you do, don't open them.

06:40.940 --> 06:43.580
Trust me no matter what.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.000
Y-Yes, sir.

06:46.430 --> 06:47.700
My eyes are shut.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.890
Now, where should we go?

06:54.490 --> 06:57.730
I know. How about we go
 to the river for some fishing?

06:58.040 --> 07:00.480
What? But how can I...

07:00.930 --> 07:04.140
Don't worry. You've got 
nothing to be afraid of.

07:04.140 --> 07:06.360
B-But... But...

07:06.360 --> 07:08.870
Oh, but let's stop by the privy first.

07:08.870 --> 07:09.970
Huh?

07:12.150 --> 07:13.740
Open your eyes.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.630
People get suspicious.

07:26.050 --> 07:27.250
It's in our nature.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.380
But we want to believe.

07:31.030 --> 07:33.200
That's in our nature, too. Isn't it strange?

07:34.070 --> 07:36.360
You can trust me, even with your eyes closed.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.020
I think that's what we call friendship.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.410
Bring on the grub! I'm starving!

07:44.420 --> 07:46.770
Oh, it must be dinnertime.

07:49.620 --> 07:50.190
Huh?

07:50.650 --> 07:54.020
Come to think of it, I don't see
 Serizawa-san or his friends.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.400
Man, I'm smashed.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.040
I'm not done drinking yet!

08:05.150 --> 08:07.650
I'm feeling a little tipsy.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.590
Welcome back, sir.

08:11.170 --> 08:12.520
He's gone and done it now.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.360
Serizawa-san.

08:15.290 --> 08:19.300
I don't see Tonoichi-dono. 
What's become of him?

08:20.800 --> 08:22.190
Hm?

08:22.190 --> 08:24.560
Oh, I killed him.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.040
So much for my best white coat.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.490
Y-You killed him?

08:30.660 --> 08:32.560
A fellow Miburo?

08:32.830 --> 08:35.000
Huh? Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.560
A guy named Tonoichi.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.010
He was a fellow ronin 
who came with us from Edo.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.980
<i>H-How could he?</i>

08:43.510 --> 08:48.360
But Serizawa-san, what if the 
Shogun's men find out we did it?

08:49.440 --> 08:51.880
Good point.

08:53.730 --> 08:57.220
Taro, go clean up.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.260
The body's by the Shijo Bridge.

09:02.260 --> 09:04.790
<i>H-He couldn't possibly...</i>

09:06.440 --> 09:07.070
Yes, sir.

09:13.070 --> 09:14.150
T-Taro-kun!

09:14.340 --> 09:14.940
Wait!

09:14.940 --> 09:15.530
Nio!

09:17.050 --> 09:19.790
I hope you're prepared
 for the consequences.

09:21.210 --> 09:21.810
Yes, sir.

09:22.450 --> 09:24.910
All right, then. Get going.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.700
Thank you, sir.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.730
<i>H-He really killed a comrade.</i>

09:39.600 --> 09:41.640
<i>Stay calm. Stay calm.</i>

09:41.910 --> 09:43.440
<i>It must have hurt.</i>

09:44.440 --> 09:46.850
<i>Please... Please rest in peace.</i>

09:56.600 --> 09:59.040
Taro-kun! What are you <i>doing?!</i>

09:59.040 --> 09:59.910
Shut up!

10:00.170 --> 10:03.410
If I poke him full of holes, he won't 
float when I toss him in the river!

10:03.760 --> 10:06.480
Y-You're talking madness—

10:06.480 --> 10:07.590
Let go!

10:09.080 --> 10:12.160
This isn't a person anymore! 
It's just a chunk of meat!

10:12.450 --> 10:13.920
Who <i>cares</i> what I do to it?!

10:13.920 --> 10:19.140
N-No! That's not the issue.
He was alive just a little while ago.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.670
This is about human dignity.

10:21.670 --> 10:24.060
A soul lived in that body.

10:25.540 --> 10:26.440
A soul?

10:27.680 --> 10:30.840
Hah! You ever <i>seen</i> a soul?

10:30.840 --> 10:32.820
If they're real, where are they?

10:33.280 --> 10:34.820
W-Well...

10:35.030 --> 10:36.570
That's why I called you naïve.

10:36.570 --> 10:39.820
You'll "make the world a better place"?
You want to "help"?

10:39.820 --> 10:41.080
Utter bullshit.

10:41.820 --> 10:43.980
You get food to eat, don't you?

10:44.160 --> 10:45.730
And a futon to sleep on?

10:46.300 --> 10:47.980
Ever eaten mud?

10:48.430 --> 10:51.290
Or slept someplace that's
covered in shit and piss?

10:51.920 --> 10:54.850
I've been going from 
job to job since I was three.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.550
Always just barely surviving.

10:57.940 --> 10:59.920
When you die, that's it.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.550
I can't stay alive anywhere but here.

11:03.090 --> 11:07.380
Where's the soul in this body?
 Or in that one?

11:07.630 --> 11:09.320
If it's there, <i>prove</i> it.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.060
Only idiots believe in stuff they can't see!

11:12.260 --> 11:16.640
I'm gonna survive! Even if I have
 to walk over corpses to do so!

11:23.000 --> 11:26.680
<i>I can't even imagine how hard 
his life must have been.</i>

11:30.920 --> 11:31.710
<i>Even so...</i>

11:33.000 --> 11:34.170
<i>I have to stop him.</i>

11:40.340 --> 11:44.710
Hijikata-san, don't you think 
it's about time to go after Nio?

11:45.080 --> 11:47.320
We can't turn back time.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.360
And Nio will figure something out.

11:51.060 --> 11:52.920
He's a man of the soil.

11:53.230 --> 11:53.980
Huh?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.970
We have that in common.

11:58.180 --> 12:01.600
If I'm being honest, 
I want to change things, too.

12:02.870 --> 12:04.090
To change this world.

12:08.930 --> 12:10.970
T-Taro-kun, look!

12:12.130 --> 12:13.350
A topless dance!

12:14.970 --> 12:16.970
D-Do you think this is funny?

12:16.970 --> 12:18.240
Oh, you stopped.

12:18.970 --> 12:20.160
I'm not joking around.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.420
When you think about it with 
a cool head, doesn't it seem weird?

12:24.740 --> 12:25.550
What?

12:26.110 --> 12:29.160
No one would go for a
 drunken stroll around here.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.930
This wasn't a row that got out of hand.

12:33.530 --> 12:35.920
It was a murder, planned in advance.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.430
Nio doesn't do what he's told.

12:39.620 --> 12:43.440
He's a crybaby, and he has 
a hell of a long way to go.

12:43.850 --> 12:47.450
Taro-kun, I'd like you to leave this to me.

12:48.520 --> 12:52.780
But I want to put the future of the 
Miburo in the hands of people like him.

12:55.050 --> 12:57.470
You want me to leave this to you?

12:58.000 --> 12:58.760
Yes.

12:59.650 --> 13:04.080
Are you nuts? Serizawa-san 
will kill <i>me</i> if you screw up!

13:04.750 --> 13:05.530
I know.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.120
<i>H-He's crazy.</i>

13:09.120 --> 13:12.130
<i>I can't trust guys like him.
It'll get me killed.</i>

13:14.200 --> 13:16.730
<i>There's... There's no hint of doubt in him.</i>

13:17.880 --> 13:19.610
A-All right.

13:19.610 --> 13:20.970
What do you want me to do?

13:21.440 --> 13:23.200
Let's start by carrying Tonoichi-san.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.230
Right.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.000
H-He's too heavy. I can't do it.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.580
Not like that, you can't.

13:30.850 --> 13:34.580
When you carry something heavy, 
you've got to press right up against it.

13:35.090 --> 13:38.500
Move him gently, 
so he doesn't get any more damaged.

13:42.150 --> 13:43.430
Hold him steady.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.540
It's hard.

13:45.540 --> 13:47.760
Don't worry. We can do this.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.900
Okay.

13:55.310 --> 13:56.770
That should do it, right?

13:56.770 --> 13:57.610
Yes.

14:01.530 --> 14:04.510
S-Serizawa-sensei! We've got trouble!

14:04.510 --> 14:05.520
Yeah?

14:10.160 --> 14:12.320
Move it! Come on, clear a path!

14:12.320 --> 14:15.520
Make way for the great samurai,
 Serizawa-sensei!

14:18.240 --> 14:19.510
How horrible.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.960
They cut him to ribbons.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.390
Who died?

14:22.390 --> 14:23.660
Who killed him?

14:23.660 --> 14:25.720
D-Damn that Taro.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.040
I'll kill that brat.

14:29.860 --> 14:33.360
A hat, socks, a sword, and a sack.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.270
The dead guy must've been a traveler.

14:35.270 --> 14:36.640
How awful.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.810
Do you think robbers got him?

14:42.190 --> 14:44.060
So that's the game.

14:44.340 --> 14:46.780
Odds were somebody would find the body.

14:47.030 --> 14:50.220
Disguising it was the smarter choice.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.560
I bet Hijikata set this up.

14:54.330 --> 14:55.530
Hijikata?

14:55.990 --> 14:57.210
That bastard.

15:03.880 --> 15:09.290
Now, how to clear this up?

15:13.790 --> 15:15.120
Perfect timing.

15:15.410 --> 15:17.910
He wanted to ask you something, too.

15:18.570 --> 15:21.340
I'm Chirinu Nio. We met two days ago.

15:21.870 --> 15:27.410
Oh? A proper reintroduction?
 I like your attitude.

15:29.190 --> 15:33.610
Taro, I hope you're ready for 
what you've got coming to you.

15:37.820 --> 15:39.960
Well, that can wait.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.120
What's your question?

15:43.340 --> 15:48.230
We'd like to hear your reasons for 
murdering your comrade, Tonoichi-san.

15:49.860 --> 15:51.090
What?

15:51.090 --> 15:54.840
<i>He's an idiot! Stupid, stupid, stupid, 
stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!</i>

15:59.150 --> 16:00.810
So it was you!

16:00.810 --> 16:03.050
<i>You</i> pulled that damn stunt.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.870
Why did I kill him, you ask? No real reason!

16:06.870 --> 16:10.860
I cut him down in a drunken rage. 
End of story.

16:10.860 --> 16:12.610
<i>We're dead.</i>

16:16.830 --> 16:21.830
You killed Tonoichi-san 
for the Miburo, didn't you?

16:22.420 --> 16:23.500
What?

16:32.650 --> 16:34.240
Don't move a muscle.

16:35.150 --> 16:40.180
I could snap your neck 
without breaking a sweat, boy.

16:40.460 --> 16:43.440
Choose your next words with care.

16:44.270 --> 16:47.080
You can't buy drinks 
anywhere near that bridge.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.400
I find it hard to believe you 
passed through there by chance.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.470
Oh, yeah?

16:51.470 --> 16:55.400
Serizawa-san, you said 
you did it in a drunken rage,

16:55.400 --> 17:00.570
but I think you lured him there...
and cut him down in cold blood.

17:00.980 --> 17:05.090
So if you had... a clear reason to kill him...

17:13.870 --> 17:15.120
Continue.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.300
Yes, sir.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.850
You did it...

17:20.040 --> 17:24.480
because Tonoichi-san was a traitor 
who planned to sell out the Miburo.

17:28.870 --> 17:32.230
Hijikata-san looked through 
Tonoichi-san's things for me.

17:32.860 --> 17:39.360
He found letters seeking solo work and 
offering information to extremists.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.850
You couldn't let that pass.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.640
So you killed him.

17:45.370 --> 17:47.040
To protect the Miburo.

17:54.530 --> 17:56.160
News to me.

17:59.220 --> 18:06.230
Don't assume a bit player like you 
can guess what a great man is thinking.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.760
I understand. I'm sorry for bothering you.

18:19.800 --> 18:24.490
If you really did just kill 
Tonoichi-san in a drunken rage,

18:25.080 --> 18:28.880
and forced Taro-kun to 
help you get away with it...

18:29.600 --> 18:33.210
And what if I did? What would you do?

18:36.800 --> 18:39.070
Nothing. Forget I said anything.

18:44.680 --> 18:48.350
<i>I don't know what I ought to do yet.</i>

18:49.080 --> 18:51.600
<i>Everyone here has his own idea of justice.</i>

18:57.990 --> 19:00.110
A-Are you out of your mind?

19:01.840 --> 19:03.250
I was so nervous.

19:03.250 --> 19:07.070
Th-That was <i>beyond</i> reckless. 
You almost got yourself killed back there.

19:07.070 --> 19:09.450
No, he wouldn't have killed me on the spot.

19:09.970 --> 19:14.670
Yes, <i>he</i> would. You're only alive because
 he happened to be in a good mood.

19:17.010 --> 19:20.180
It's not funny. Not even a little.

19:20.340 --> 19:22.200
Well then, if you'll excuse me.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.770
Hijikata.

19:25.980 --> 19:28.880
Tell me about that guy.

19:29.390 --> 19:30.850
He's just a kid.

19:31.180 --> 19:36.940
No, I don't think so. 
No normal kid has guts like that.

19:39.020 --> 19:44.440
Serizawa-san, you keep trying 
to get things done too forcefully.

19:46.950 --> 19:51.210
A good commander's not afraid to take blame.

19:56.010 --> 19:57.190
Why a bonfire?

19:57.520 --> 20:02.170
I would have liked to bury him, 
but we can't do even that much.

20:03.400 --> 20:10.970
So even if his body returns to the earth, 
I want his soul to fly free through the sky.

20:12.810 --> 20:14.360
Where's the soul?

20:14.730 --> 20:16.600
If it's there, <i>prove</i> it.

20:17.260 --> 20:20.260
Seriously? I don't get you.

20:21.650 --> 20:22.340
No.

20:22.910 --> 20:27.100
But I don't think it's fair to deny it...

20:28.150 --> 20:31.190
if you can't prove it's <i>not</i> there.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.870
I really don't get you at all.

20:37.530 --> 20:38.850
Oh, I know! Taro-kun.

20:40.670 --> 20:41.920
Take my hands.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.700
Huh? N-No way.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.890
Just do it.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.280
Don't say anything. Just close your eyes.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.130
Why should I?

20:48.360 --> 20:50.160
Whatever you do, don't open them.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.520
Not even a little.

20:52.970 --> 20:54.650
O-Okay.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.070
Trust me no matter what.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.770
O-Okay.

20:59.770 --> 21:02.530
Now, let's take a walk around the compound.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.090
Huh? Like this?

21:06.040 --> 21:09.890
I know you can find Serizawa-san's room,
 even with your eyes closed.

21:09.890 --> 21:12.040
What? You've gotta be kidding me.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.120
Don't worry. I'll come with you.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.010
That only makes it worse!

21:16.550 --> 21:19.190
Oh, but do you mind 
if we stop by the privy first?

21:19.190 --> 21:20.810
Huh? Why should I?

21:22.310 --> 21:24.630
Okay. Open your eyes.

21:33.070 --> 21:36.060
Well? Not so scary, right?

21:36.250 --> 21:38.230
No! It gave me the heebie-jeebies!

21:38.230 --> 21:39.760
Stop messing with me!

21:39.760 --> 21:41.870
What? Why?

21:41.870 --> 21:44.910
Are we not friends yet?

21:44.950 --> 21:49.950
<b>Where 
the</b>

21:44.950 --> 21:49.950
<b>Soul 
Dwells</b>

23:20.090 --> 23:25.510
<b>Next time</b>

23:22.710 --> 23:23.900
Chirinu Nio here.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.310
There's one more: Saito Hajime-kun.

23:31.730 --> 23:36.840
He acts gruff and he's got a mean glare, 
but he's as tough as any grown man.

23:37.260 --> 23:42.270
Oh, I wonder if he'll yell at me
 for calling him a kid.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.960
Next time: "The Name of the Enemy."

23:45.290 --> 23:46.300
It won't disappoint.

23:47.110 --> 23:49.940
<b>The
Name</b>

23:47.110 --> 23:49.940
<b>of the
Enemy</b>
