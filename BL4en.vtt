00:17.940 --> 00:20.490
<b>Reo-kun, over here!</b>

00:20.730 --> 00:24.020
<b>Mikage-kun's grades are impeccable.</b>

00:24.020 --> 00:26.960
<b>Oh, yes. That boy does everything perfectly.</b>

00:27.890 --> 00:31.810

00:59.830 --> 01:01.040

01:03.440 --> 01:06.080
<b>Keep your eyes on me.</b>

01:07.210 --> 01:09.670
<b>Yeah. Let's go.</b>

02:42.520 --> 02:42.560
<b>Episode</b>

02:42.610 --> 02:46.030
<b>Episode</b>

02:43.180 --> 02:46.020
<b>Chameleon</b>

02:47.500 --> 02:48.980
<b>This goal...</b>

02:49.430 --> 02:53.990
<b>At first, I pretended I was going this way, 
but then I stepped inside Karasu,</b>

02:53.990 --> 02:57.570
<b>and slipped into Otoya's
 and Rin's blind spots...</b>

03:04.110 --> 03:05.450
<b>Hold up, hold up. Question!</b>

03:05.710 --> 03:09.680
<b>Did ya start moving <i>after </i>
you'd thought all that through?</b>

03:09.680 --> 03:15.170
<b>Well, it was more like I was reacting
 while moving and thinking, I guess?</b>

03:15.730 --> 03:22.150
<b>And last of all, I squeezed between
Rin and Shidou and took a shot.</b>

03:22.720 --> 03:25.150
<b>Wow, you're somethin' else, bro.</b>

03:25.150 --> 03:28.310
<b>So you felt all that instantly?</b>

03:28.310 --> 03:33.900
<b>Uh, yeah, but I don't think I've ever made
 such complicated movements before.</b>

03:33.900 --> 03:38.440
<b>I didn't think ya would 
actually score there, either.</b>

03:38.960 --> 03:42.480
<b>I crossed it thinkin' either Rin-kun 
or Shidou-kun would get on the end.</b>

03:42.820 --> 03:48.450
<b>Lookin' back and analyzin' yer own play 
like this is important for ya, Isagi-kun.</b>

03:48.450 --> 03:53.000
<b>Why'd you tell me to think as a reflex?</b>

03:53.000 --> 03:54.430
<b>Well...</b>

03:55.410 --> 03:58.000
<b>S'like... Ya know them 
fallin' blocks games, yeah?</b>

04:00.570 --> 04:05.280
<b>They start off slow, so ya can think 
carefully about where yer placin' the blocks.</b>

04:05.590 --> 04:11.190
<b>But as the pace picks up, 
ya don't get time to think.</b>

04:11.890 --> 04:17.860
<b>Playin' at a pace to coexist with Rin-kun 
and Shidou-kun is as difficult as that.</b>

04:19.090 --> 04:21.050
<b>Huh. Makes sense.</b>

04:21.050 --> 04:23.860
<b>Doing things the way I always do
 would've been too slow.</b>

04:23.860 --> 04:26.360
<b>How're the blocks piled up?</b>

04:26.360 --> 04:28.910
<b>Which block are ya holdin' in reserve?</b>

04:28.910 --> 04:31.870
<b>What's the shape of the next block?</b>

04:32.190 --> 04:35.830
<b>Ya grasp this information, 
think about it, then act.</b>

04:35.940 --> 04:40.300
<b>Action</b>

04:35.940 --> 04:40.300
<b>Grasp</b>

04:35.940 --> 04:40.300

04:35.940 --> 04:40.300
<b>Action</b>

04:35.940 --> 04:40.300
<b>Grasp</b>

04:35.940 --> 04:40.300
<b>Thinking</b>

04:35.940 --> 04:40.300
<b>A Skilled Gamer</b>

04:36.320 --> 04:40.300
<b>Skilled gamers can process 
all of that at an incredible speed.</b>

04:40.630 --> 04:45.260
<b>They keep pressin' the optimal 
combinations of buttons reflexively.</b>

04:46.110 --> 04:49.180
<b>It's the same with soccer.</b>

04:49.570 --> 04:51.040
<b>I see.</b>

04:52.950 --> 04:59.240
<b>In that moment, I could see where the others
 were and what they were trying to do,</b>

05:00.300 --> 05:07.350
<b>as well as the weapons I had available
and where the next pass was coming from.</b>

05:09.090 --> 05:12.040
<b>I could process all of my skills 
at super high speed...</b>

05:13.600 --> 05:17.120
<b>which is how I got to the ball
in prime shooting position first.</b>

05:17.340 --> 05:22.140
<b>That's right. But that's thanks 
to everythin' ya built up so far.</b>

05:22.140 --> 05:25.050
<b>From the outside, it's like ya 
suddenly did somethin' amazin'.</b>

05:25.340 --> 05:30.390
<b>But in reality, it's just yer speed that shot up 
'cause what ya can do has been condensed.</b>

05:30.390 --> 05:35.730
<b>So it ain't <i>actually</i> a new skill. Software's 
the same, but the hardware got upgraded.</b>

05:35.730 --> 05:41.270
<b>Yup. It's like yer cell phone service
 going from 4G to 5G.</b>

05:42.280 --> 05:44.710
<b><i>So that's what caused that sensation?</i></b>

05:46.130 --> 05:50.760
<b><i>Being so completely in the zone,
I almost lost myself. A trance.</i></b>

05:52.220 --> 05:57.060
<b>But I could only do it 
because a load of things aligned.</b>

05:57.630 --> 06:00.880
<b>Rin and Shidou were competing, 
so it was easy to slip behind them.</b>

06:01.320 --> 06:04.980
<b>More importantly, I couldn't 
have done it without you two.</b>

06:04.980 --> 06:08.040
<b>Thanks, Nanase and Hiori.</b>

06:09.100 --> 06:14.640
<b>Well, to be honest, my dude, 
I couldn't keep up with anyone else.</b>

06:15.090 --> 06:16.140
<b>How do you mean?</b>

06:17.540 --> 06:19.780
<b>This may sound rude, bro,</b>

06:20.320 --> 06:26.090
<b>but Rin-kun's and Shidou-san's movements 
were so outta this world, I couldn't follow 'em.</b>

06:26.800 --> 06:31.790
<b>But I felt I could keep up with you,
 Isagi-san, if only barely.</b>

06:32.160 --> 06:37.540
<b>I see. Well, thanks to you, my range of options
over what I could do increased, so it's all good.</b>

06:37.540 --> 06:39.940
<b>In fact, it was huge for me.</b>

06:39.940 --> 06:42.320
<b>And Hiori-san was on the money, too.</b>

06:42.720 --> 06:45.630
<b>I just played like I usually do.</b>

06:46.000 --> 06:51.040
<b>Isagi-kun's goal allowed me and
 Nanase-kun to show our worth,</b>

06:51.040 --> 06:54.350
<b>so I think the three of us
 did what we could.</b>

06:54.820 --> 06:58.180
<b>Yeah, I did all I could. 
I have no regrets, either.</b>

06:58.180 --> 07:01.350
<b>Same here. Now we just 
hafta wait for the results.</b>

07:02.590 --> 07:05.320
<b>Great job on the tryouts, bros!</b>

07:05.320 --> 07:07.560
<b>Ouch, that hurt.</b>

07:08.180 --> 07:09.780
<b>My bad.</b>

07:10.310 --> 07:14.490
<b><i>I've now unlocked this new sensation, 
though I haven't completely mastered it.</i></b>

07:18.040 --> 07:23.750
<b><i>If I can increase the reproducibility of 
that trancelike sensation and use it at will,</i></b>

07:25.100 --> 07:27.380
<b><i>I can aim even higher.</i></b>

07:27.920 --> 07:31.130
<b>Ain't the next game 'bout to start?</b>

07:31.510 --> 07:33.170
<b>The second match!</b>

07:37.490 --> 07:42.310
<b>3rd Selection: Tryouts</b>

07:37.830 --> 07:42.310
<b>Match 2</b>

07:47.540 --> 07:52.240
<b><i>I've grown a little stronger 
since you picked someone else.</i></b>

07:53.470 --> 07:57.410
<b><i>To catch up to you, 
I've scrabbled my way up.</i></b>

07:57.780 --> 07:58.710
<b><i>But...</i></b>

08:00.250 --> 08:02.290
<b><i>You're still ahead of me.</i></b>

08:03.540 --> 08:05.580
<b><i>So I'm gonna prove right here and now...</i></b>

08:07.340 --> 08:10.630
<b><i>that I'm the one who should
 be standing next to you.</i></b>

08:10.630 --> 08:11.410
<b>Oh?</b>

08:11.410 --> 08:12.990
<b>Huh? He's even faster now.</b>

08:12.990 --> 08:14.010
<b>That Number 10...</b>

08:14.690 --> 08:16.220
<b>I will mark him.</b>

08:16.610 --> 08:18.180
<b><i>That spot there, Nagi?</i></b>

08:18.980 --> 08:21.440
<b><i>The type of pass you want, the timing of it...</i></b>

08:22.250 --> 08:23.730
<b><i>I know it all better than anyone!</i></b>

08:23.730 --> 08:25.100
<b>Good pass.</b>

08:25.440 --> 08:27.150
<b>Nope, not really.</b>

08:28.090 --> 08:29.540
<b><i>S-So tall.</i></b>

08:29.540 --> 08:32.450
<b><i>The tallest high school
 soccer player, Ishikari.</i></b>

08:33.190 --> 08:35.110
<b>That was a bit low for me.</b>

08:35.110 --> 08:36.120
<b>Aw, man.</b>

08:36.620 --> 08:37.820
<b>It went to <i>him</i>.</b>

08:39.190 --> 08:40.790
<b>Okay, let's counter!</b>

08:40.790 --> 08:43.250
<b>Pass it, you long bottom lashes jerk.</b>

08:45.670 --> 08:47.040
<b>Use me, Rin!</b>

08:47.320 --> 08:49.750
<b>I'm what people call a "useful monk."</b>

08:51.460 --> 08:56.170
<b><i>I-It came to me! A pass from
 the No. 1 in the rankings!</i></b>

08:56.170 --> 09:01.060
<b><i>I-I'm totally pulling off an awesome
 counterattack with the No. 1!</i></b>

09:01.330 --> 09:02.520
<b>Hold it, Igaguri.</b>

09:02.840 --> 09:04.790
<b>I'll turn you into a useless monk.</b>

09:05.410 --> 09:07.520
<b><i>Not making it easy for me, huh?</i></b>

09:08.690 --> 09:11.230
<b><i>Either way, I can't take
the ball nearer the goal.</i></b>

09:11.640 --> 09:13.740
<b><i>This needs to be a telling final ball.</i></b>

09:14.550 --> 09:16.030
<b><i>But who do I pass to?</i></b>

09:16.330 --> 09:18.570
<b><i>Which genius should I follow?</i></b>

09:19.290 --> 09:22.060
<b><i>I'm at the crossroads of my destiny.</i></b>

09:24.560 --> 09:28.820
<b><i>Which genius is gonna 
yank me up to the next stage?</i></b>

09:30.500 --> 09:32.020
<b>What the hell are you <i>doing</i>?!</b>

09:32.020 --> 09:34.320
<b>Want me to crack open your skull, Igaguri?!</b>

09:34.950 --> 09:35.670
<b>Namu!</b>

09:36.920 --> 09:38.140
<b><i>Aw, hell.</i></b>

09:39.720 --> 09:42.060
<b><i>I panicked and passed to Shidou.</i></b>

09:43.350 --> 09:45.730
<b>This way, Topknot.</b>

09:45.730 --> 09:48.690
<b>Crap. You're going around 
behind me, Mr. Antenna?</b>

09:48.690 --> 09:50.150
<b>But I can...</b>

09:51.070 --> 09:53.030
<b>still just about reach it.</b>

09:53.030 --> 09:54.720
<b>Wow, cool.</b>

09:54.720 --> 09:57.030
<b>The hell? Stop getting in our way!</b>

09:59.430 --> 10:02.590
<b>Show me what you've got, No. 5.</b>

10:13.170 --> 10:14.640
<b><i>Drag scissors.</i></b>

10:14.990 --> 10:19.340
<b><i>You shift your opponent's center of gravity, 
then dribble past at top speed.</i></b>

10:19.920 --> 10:20.970
<b><i>He's explosive!</i></b>

10:21.700 --> 10:24.720
<b><i>The No. 1 is being treated 
like a child one-on-one!</i></b>

10:24.720 --> 10:27.460
<b>Soccer is fundamentally 
played one-on-one.</b>

10:27.460 --> 10:31.610
<b>In one-on-one situations, I'm confident 
there's no one better than me in Japan.</b>

10:32.090 --> 10:33.150
<b>That's the good shit!</b>

10:33.510 --> 10:35.360
<b>Now do it to me, Goggle Man!</b>

10:37.770 --> 10:38.780
<b><i>Yukimiya.</i></b>

10:39.310 --> 10:44.120
<b><i>Despite his looks, he's an infighter 
who relies on his speed and physique.</i></b>

10:44.570 --> 10:49.000
<b><i>While Bachira's dribbling relies on 
technique and creativity to sneak past...</i></b>

10:49.380 --> 10:51.000
<b>This way, slowpoke.</b>

10:53.040 --> 10:57.460
<b><i>...this guy's all about forcing his way
 through with power and speed.</i></b>

10:57.800 --> 11:01.180
<b><i>This is the No. 5, Yukimiya Kenyu...</i></b>

11:01.580 --> 11:03.970
<b><i>the One-on-One Emperor.</i></b>

11:04.900 --> 11:07.380
<b>We can't beat him alone. 
Let's team up, Ishikari!</b>

11:07.380 --> 11:09.690
<b>I don't like you ordering me around.</b>

11:10.200 --> 11:11.440
<b>But I'll do it.</b>

11:11.440 --> 11:12.850
<b>Use this side, Yukimiya!</b>

11:13.150 --> 11:14.860
<b>Nope, nah, not a chance.</b>

11:15.960 --> 11:18.570
<b>It'll all resolve peacefully if I score.</b>

11:20.260 --> 11:21.720
<b><i>A mid-range shot from </i>there<i>?</i></b>

11:22.120 --> 11:24.490
<b><i>But wait. He has no sight of goal.</i></b>

11:26.830 --> 11:28.090
<b>A miskick!</b>

11:29.090 --> 11:31.080
<b>I'm a pacifist.</b>

11:33.210 --> 11:36.750
<b><i>What's with that trajectory? 
It's dropping sharply and curling.</i></b>

11:37.470 --> 11:38.710
<b><i>A gyro shot?</i></b>

11:39.350 --> 11:41.510
<b>I have arrived.</b>

11:41.510 --> 11:43.680
<b>Wow! Nice!</b>

11:43.680 --> 11:45.430
<b>Oh? There's another one, isn't there?</b>

11:47.850 --> 11:48.810
<b>Yikes.</b>

11:49.980 --> 11:51.060
<b>That's got weight.</b>

11:52.130 --> 11:52.910
<b>Nagi.</b>

11:53.350 --> 11:54.560
<b>You controlled it, huh?</b>

11:56.640 --> 11:58.730
<b>Nicely done, No. 6.</b>

12:02.550 --> 12:05.490
<b><i>The top guys are playing
at hyperdimensional level.</i></b>

12:09.450 --> 12:13.380
<b><i>You're not the Nagi I used to know.</i></b>

12:14.390 --> 12:15.860
<b>Sorry, Mr. Four-Eyes.</b>

12:16.590 --> 12:17.750
<b>I stole your goal.</b>

12:25.260 --> 12:27.890
<b><i>There's no way I could've
 scored a goal like that.</i></b>

12:28.370 --> 12:30.890
<b><i>Such a powerful yet precise shot.</i></b>

12:31.400 --> 12:32.900
<b><i>They're not coordinating,</i></b>

12:32.900 --> 12:36.250
<b><i>but they enhance each other 
by hurling super plays around.</i></b>

12:36.610 --> 12:38.690
<b>Good control, Nagi-kun.</b>

12:38.960 --> 12:40.600
<b>Nice shot, Mr. Four-Eyes.</b>

12:41.050 --> 12:43.160
<b>Let's do this, um...</b>

12:43.620 --> 12:44.620
<b>Yukimiya.</b>

12:45.860 --> 12:47.480
<b>You can call me Yukki.</b>

12:48.960 --> 12:50.770
<b><i>At my level, I can't reach you.</i></b>

12:51.950 --> 12:55.960
<b><i>I'm not good enough to 
satisfy you anymore, Nagi.</i></b>

12:57.310 --> 12:59.070
<b><i>Look at you having fun.</i></b>

13:00.400 --> 13:04.300
<b><i>You're a totally different person 
from the bored guy I used to pass to.</i></b>

13:04.760 --> 13:05.500
<b><i>Jerk.</i></b>

13:12.080 --> 13:17.680
<b><i>You're not mine anymore, are you?</i></b>

13:21.230 --> 13:23.110
<b>Time for a counterattack.</b>

13:23.110 --> 13:24.950
<b>Get moving, antenna-head.</b>

13:24.950 --> 13:27.320
<b>Don't boss me around, Rin-Rin.</b>

13:27.320 --> 13:29.470
<b>I live my life how <i>I</i> want.</b>

13:29.470 --> 13:32.740
<b>Who are you calling "Rin-Rin," pest?</b>

13:33.290 --> 13:35.710
<b><i>The Top 6 really are on another level.</i></b>

13:36.610 --> 13:39.710
<b><i>They have outstanding weapons
 that go beyond 100%</i></b>

13:39.710 --> 13:42.750
<b><i>where normal people can't reach,
 however hard they try.</i></b>

13:43.140 --> 13:44.300
<b><i>And then, there's me.</i></b>

13:45.300 --> 13:47.610
<b><i>A balanced all-rounder.</i></b>

13:48.320 --> 13:52.310
<b><i>No matter how much I improve the quality 
of my play, the max I can manage is 99%.</i></b>

13:52.790 --> 13:54.400
<b><i>With my specs,</i></b>

13:55.060 --> 13:57.730
<b><i>how am I supposed to 
go up against the Top 6?</i></b>

14:20.040 --> 14:25.010
<b>You weasel. You went for height

14:25.010 --> 14:27.970

14:28.200 --> 14:30.320

17:11.570 --> 17:13.920
<b><i>Not happening, Nagi.</i></b>

17:13.940 --> 17:15.680
<b>He's not passing?</b>

17:15.680 --> 17:17.140
<b>Huh? A shot?</b>

17:17.490 --> 17:20.480
<b><i>Just like you're changing at Blue Lock,</i></b>

17:20.480 --> 17:23.390
<b><i>I'll change into whatever color I want!</i></b>

17:25.640 --> 17:27.850
<b>He messed up! It's a miskick!</b>

17:28.500 --> 17:29.400
<b>That trajectory...</b>

17:29.720 --> 17:31.360
<b>It's the same as before?</b>

17:39.260 --> 17:42.410
<b>For real? Did he just copy Yukimiya's shot?</b>

17:45.550 --> 17:49.710
<b><i>This is my new play style: the Chameleon.</i></b>

17:53.530 --> 17:54.670
<b><i>Wow.</i></b>

17:55.600 --> 18:00.600
<b><i>Reo's goal just now used his copying ability,
 taking full advantage of his deftness.</i></b>

18:01.450 --> 18:06.450
<b><i>That's the answer Mikage Reo 
has found to survive in Blue Lock.</i></b>

18:07.230 --> 18:11.600
<b>Wow. Copying plays? Bro's invincible now.</b>

18:11.600 --> 18:14.190
<b>Nah, it's still a copy.</b>

18:14.530 --> 18:20.160
<b>No matter how well he copies a move, 
the reproduction's 99% at best.</b>

18:21.150 --> 18:26.200
<b>So against a formidable 100%-or-higher
 original move, it ain't winnin' out so easily.</b>

18:27.040 --> 18:32.170
<b><i>That's true. Even if he can copy a move, 
it'll always be inferior to the original.</i></b>

18:32.380 --> 18:37.510
<b><i>Plus, things like speed and height are 
physical attributes that can't be copied.</i></b>

18:38.170 --> 18:41.770
<b><i>I can't see how he'd deal with that.</i></b>

18:42.370 --> 18:46.520
<b><i>Which means Reo's new copying 
ability is still under development.</i></b>

18:56.720 --> 19:02.620
<b><i>I'm still not good enough 
to beat the Top 6.</i></b>

19:03.760 --> 19:07.750
<b><i>But I now know the path to take to evolve.</i></b>

19:08.670 --> 19:10.800
<b>We lost, Reo.</b>

19:12.870 --> 19:15.280
<b>But that was a nice goal.</b>

19:16.150 --> 19:21.460
<b>I like your choice of copying the weapons 
of other strong players. It's very you.</b>

19:27.520 --> 19:28.270
<b>But...</b>

19:29.480 --> 19:30.860
<b>It's still not enough.</b>

19:31.770 --> 19:33.630
<b>It's not the soccer you want to play.</b>

19:35.670 --> 19:36.420
<b>Right.</b>

19:38.250 --> 19:41.400
<b>Then, leave me alone.

<b>In that case, that makes this easy.</b>

22:02.970 --> 22:06.880
<b>I watched the video of the

22:07.100 --> 22:09.220
<b>and in a word, they're shit.</b>

22:10.180 --> 22:13.530

22:27.170 --> 22:29.980

22:29.980 --> 22:32.950

22:32.950 --> 22:36.660
<b>I-Itoshi Sae-kun.

22:45.460 --> 22:49.680
