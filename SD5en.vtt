<b>I'm pooped, woman.</b>

00:10.170 --> 00:15.300
<b><i>Hit me once every ten seconds</i>
<i>or I kill the boy.</i></b>

00:15.390 --> 00:18.760
<b><i>Honestly, I thought I was done for</i>
<i>when she said that,</i></b>

00:18.850 --> 00:20.270
<b><i>but Lu's doing pretty good.</i></b>

00:22.060 --> 00:23.350
<b>Aw, no.</b>

00:25.270 --> 00:27.610
<b>Oh, lucky me.</b>

00:27.690 --> 00:29.980
<b>But I'm begging you,

00:32.360 --> 00:33.650
<b>My turn!</b>

00:34.900 --> 00:36.200
<b>Lu!</b>

00:38.240 --> 00:39.780
<b>Guess the fun's over.</b>

00:39.870 --> 00:41.370
<b>But you're better than I--</b>

00:42.910 --> 00:43.750
<b>No way.</b>

00:46.370 --> 00:49.170
<b>Shin, your voice cracked
when you said "Lu"!</b>

00:51.840 --> 00:54.050
<b><i>Is she a happy drunk after all?</i></b>

01:03.310 --> 01:04.520
<b>Oh, no.</b>

01:11.860 --> 01:12.860
<b><i>Marvelous…</i></b>

01:14.440 --> 01:17.660
<b>Give me more. Try to kill me.</b>

01:17.740 --> 01:18.870
<b>Huh?</b>

01:18.950 --> 01:21.660
<b>I don't kill, lady.</b>

01:21.740 --> 01:25.120
<b>It's against our family rule.</b>

01:26.000 --> 01:26.830
<b>Lu…</b>

01:26.920 --> 01:30.040
<b>Family rule? What are you talking about?</b>

01:30.130 --> 01:33.630
<b>Promises we keep as a family!</b>

01:33.710 --> 01:36.880
<b>Shin, Mr. Manager, Ms. Aoi, Hana,</b>

01:36.970 --> 01:40.550
<b>they're all my precious family!</b>

01:41.010 --> 01:42.100
<b>Huh?</b>

01:42.180 --> 01:45.180
<b>The Sakamotos are a family of three.</b>

01:45.270 --> 01:46.230
<b>Are you stupid?</b>

01:46.890 --> 01:48.230
<b>Stupid?</b>

01:48.350 --> 01:52.150
<b>I learned how to run a cash register
right after coming to Japan.</b>

01:52.230 --> 01:56.320
<b>Even Hana has her eye on me
for the next shift leader.</b>

01:56.400 --> 01:57.740
<b>And you have the nerve…</b>

01:59.030 --> 02:01.780
<b>to call me stupid, you bitch?</b>

02:01.870 --> 02:03.490
<b><i>No, she's an angry drunk!</i></b>

02:04.200 --> 02:05.700
<b><i>Where's this power coming from?</i></b>

02:07.120 --> 02:08.370
<b>Damn--</b>

02:11.500 --> 02:12.340
<b>What?</b>

02:15.090 --> 02:15.920
<b>What?</b>

02:16.010 --> 02:17.550
<b>What was I doing?</b>

02:18.800 --> 02:20.300
<b>Who's this lady?</b>

02:21.050 --> 02:22.800
<b>Oh, Shin.</b>

02:22.890 --> 02:24.220
<b>Whatcha doing?</b>

02:24.310 --> 02:25.720
<b>Where are we?</b>

02:25.810 --> 02:28.560
<b><i>She sobered up all of a sudden!</i></b>

02:28.640 --> 02:33.150
<b>Are you trying to let me off easy?
You've got some nerve!</b>

02:34.650 --> 02:37.360
<b>I can't remember the last time anyone's…</b>

02:37.440 --> 02:38.280
<b><i>Shit!</i></b>

02:38.360 --> 02:40.490
<b>…pushed me this far.</b>

02:42.030 --> 02:44.700
<b>I absolutely love strong rivals!</b>

02:44.780 --> 02:48.000
<b>You really gave me chills!</b>

02:48.540 --> 02:51.790
<b>-Come on, let's do one more round! Please?
-Are we… off the hook?</b>

02:51.880 --> 02:52.960
<b>Hey, stop it!</b>

04:23.970 --> 04:25.970
<b>10g of potassium perchlorate.</b>

04:26.050 --> 04:27.550
<b>SOURCE OF STRENGTH</b>

<b>3.5g of Nitro GK.</b>

04:36.150 --> 04:38.150
<b>I remember you now, Boiled.</b>

04:40.690 --> 04:43.190
<b>Time to show you what I can really do.</b>

04:44.780 --> 04:46.530
<b>I dunno what kind of trick that is,</b>

04:46.610 --> 04:49.830
<b>but what difference does it make
that you got a little thinner?</b>

04:50.410 --> 04:53.330
<b>If you want a fight,
you might wanna hurry.</b>

04:53.410 --> 04:56.580
<b>I bet your family's in a pinch too
right about now.</b>

04:56.670 --> 04:58.540
<b>I'm not worried about that.</b>

04:58.630 --> 05:02.340
<b>I have people that I can count on now.</b>

05:03.670 --> 05:04.970
<b>So what?</b>

05:06.010 --> 05:06.880
<b><i>He's so fast…</i></b>

05:36.710 --> 05:40.170
<b><i>So this is the real Sakamoto,</i>
<i>the invincible hit man!</i></b>

05:47.590 --> 05:48.840
<b><i>But how?</i></b>

05:51.300 --> 05:56.600
<b><i>How can he still be so strong</i>
<i>after he quit being a hit man?</i></b>

05:59.270 --> 06:01.110
<b>You're tough to beat, Boiled.</b>

06:02.020 --> 06:06.280
<b>Like you, I used to use my strength
to hurt people.</b>

06:06.900 --> 06:08.910
<b>But now…</b>

06:10.990 --> 06:13.870
<b><i>I choose to use my strength</i>
<i>to protect the people I love.</i></b>

06:14.540 --> 06:15.750
<b>That's…</b>

06:17.370 --> 06:20.330
<b><i>what makes me strong now, Boiled.</i></b>

06:24.630 --> 06:27.090
<b>Wow, this view is amazing!</b>

06:27.170 --> 06:28.630
<b>Yeah, it's beautiful.</b>

06:29.260 --> 06:32.350
<b>But not as beautiful as you…</b>

06:33.180 --> 06:34.310
<b>Satoshi?</b>

06:36.430 --> 06:37.680
<b>What was that?</b>

06:43.650 --> 06:47.690
<b>Sakamoto, I gotta give it to you…</b>

06:47.780 --> 06:51.160
<b>You're hard-boiled as hell.</b>

06:59.500 --> 07:00.960
<b>Hey, Shin?</b>

07:03.580 --> 07:04.750
<b>Ms. Aoi?</b>

07:04.840 --> 07:07.130
<b>I thought we were in the haunted house.</b>

07:07.210 --> 07:08.420
<b>How did we get here?</b>

07:08.510 --> 07:11.630
<b>We… must've all gotten worn out!</b>

07:11.720 --> 07:13.390
<b>It was pretty intense in there.</b>

07:13.970 --> 07:16.140
<b>How did your clothes get so dirty?</b>

07:16.220 --> 07:19.600
<b>Well, those zombies were tough, and--</b>

07:19.680 --> 07:21.350
<b>-Tough?
-Oops…</b>

07:21.440 --> 07:22.560
<b>Where's Taro?</b>

07:22.650 --> 07:23.860
<b>I dunno!</b>

07:23.940 --> 07:25.570
<b>I'll go look for him!</b>

07:30.150 --> 07:32.700
<b>Watch your step as you get off, please.</b>

07:36.870 --> 07:39.250
<b>Are you okay? What happened?</b>

07:39.870 --> 07:41.910
<b>-Little lady.
-Yes?</b>

07:42.790 --> 07:44.960
<b>Don't embarrass a guy…</b>

07:46.130 --> 07:47.670
<b>by asking him how he got hurt.</b>

07:47.750 --> 07:50.130
<b>No, I mean…
You're gonna have to pay for damages.</b>

07:54.930 --> 07:56.760
<b>You win, Sakamoto.</b>

07:57.350 --> 07:59.140
<b>I'll back off from you.</b>

08:00.100 --> 08:01.980
<b>But you're still gonna have…</b>

08:04.900 --> 08:06.730
<b>Five pork buns, coming right up!</b>

08:07.730 --> 08:09.150
<b>Not even listening, huh?</b>

08:11.820 --> 08:13.490
<b>That looks good.</b>

08:13.570 --> 08:14.660
<b>Can I have one?</b>

08:20.040 --> 08:22.080
<b>Your leftovers? How lucky of me.</b>

08:23.790 --> 08:25.830
<b>The rest is for my family.</b>

08:25.920 --> 08:28.790
<b>You, a family guy? Who would've thought.</b>

08:28.880 --> 08:30.710
<b>Mr. Sakamoto?!</b>

08:33.420 --> 08:36.340
<b>You're thin! Why? How?</b>

08:36.430 --> 08:38.300
<b>People lose weight when they work out.</b>

08:38.390 --> 08:40.310
<b>But not that much in a single day!</b>

08:40.390 --> 08:43.680
<b>You look just like you used to.
You're so cool!</b>

08:43.770 --> 08:46.480
<b>By the way, what are you gonna do
about that bounty?</b>

08:46.560 --> 08:49.230
<b>Dondenkai will keep trying to kill you.</b>

08:49.320 --> 08:50.230
<b>Well…</b>

08:55.280 --> 08:57.490
<b>Bounty?</b>

08:57.570 --> 08:59.410
<b>What's that about?</b>

09:02.830 --> 09:04.710
<b><i>Why am I in trouble?</i></b>

09:06.120 --> 09:08.670
<b>Hana, let's go over there and play.</b>

09:08.750 --> 09:11.090
<b>I want two cotton candies!</b>

09:11.170 --> 09:12.920
<b>What a self-indulgent child!</b>

09:13.010 --> 09:14.260
<b>Such potential for strength.</b>

09:17.760 --> 09:18.680
<b>So?</b>

09:20.140 --> 09:22.310
<b>There's a bounty on my head, and…</b>

09:22.390 --> 09:24.730
<b>hit men have been out to get me.</b>

09:25.520 --> 09:26.690
<b>Like today…</b>

09:26.770 --> 09:29.520
<b>Why on earth would you not tell me
something like that?!</b>

09:31.270 --> 09:33.570
<b>Men are clumsy creatures, miss.</b>

09:34.030 --> 09:36.950
<b>He just wanted you and your kid…</b>

09:38.490 --> 09:43.040
<b>to enjoy the amusement park
without worrying about anything.</b>

09:44.750 --> 09:46.660
<b>That's pretty hard-boiled, I'd say.</b>

09:46.750 --> 09:48.670
<b>And who are you?</b>

09:48.750 --> 09:50.420
<b>The name's Boiled.</b>

09:50.960 --> 09:52.210
<b>I'm a professional hit man.</b>

09:52.300 --> 09:56.220
<b>Would you mind not killing my husband?</b>

09:56.840 --> 09:57.840
<b>Yes, ma'am…</b>

09:57.930 --> 10:00.550
<b>Besides, did you really think
you could hide this?</b>

10:01.140 --> 10:04.100
<b>Well, I just… I didn't want to worry you.</b>

10:04.890 --> 10:06.850
<b>Have you forgotten?</b>

10:07.390 --> 10:11.900
<b>Sakamoto family rule number six.
"Do not hide things from each other"!</b>

10:12.650 --> 10:16.400
<b>I'd rather you go and put it all to rest
than go behind my back!</b>

10:20.490 --> 10:23.200
<b>Now that that's settled,</b>

10:23.280 --> 10:25.120
<b>let's go watch the parade.</b>

10:27.830 --> 10:30.460
<b>That's one hard-boiled wife you've got…</b>

10:43.550 --> 10:47.890
<b>But Mr. Sakamoto, how exactly
are we going to put this to rest?</b>

10:47.980 --> 10:52.400
<b>We have to take down the client
and make them withdraw the bounty.</b>

10:52.480 --> 10:54.270
<b>How reckless.</b>

10:54.360 --> 10:56.650
<b>The bounty's managed by the JAA.</b>

10:56.730 --> 10:59.110
<b>You won't figure out who put out the hit.</b>

10:59.200 --> 11:02.910
<b>I suppose our boss
probably has some contacts in the JAA.</b>

11:02.990 --> 11:06.330
<b>Well then, why don't you ask
your boss from Dondenkai for us?</b>

11:06.410 --> 11:08.410
<b>Why would I do that for you?</b>

11:09.080 --> 11:11.120
<b>I don't know where my boss is, anyway.</b>

11:11.210 --> 11:12.750
<b>What? You're useless.</b>

11:12.830 --> 11:15.000
<b>You're the one asking too much of people!</b>

11:17.550 --> 11:19.090
<b>Anyway… We'll be going now.</b>

11:19.170 --> 11:21.130
<b>See ya, Sakamoto.</b>

11:21.220 --> 11:23.760
<b>Bye guys, send my love to Lu.</b>

11:26.720 --> 11:28.270
<b>Now what?</b>

11:28.350 --> 11:31.770
<b>We still don't know where
the Dondenkai headquarters is.</b>

11:32.690 --> 11:34.270
<b>I might know someone.</b>

11:39.690 --> 11:41.200
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

11:41.280 --> 11:42.820
<b>Got a tummy ache?</b>

11:42.910 --> 11:46.450
<b>Mr. Sakamoto

11:46.530 --> 11:49.700
<b>Oh, yeah.
I'm not surprised, seeing how he eats.</b>

11:57.340 --> 11:58.460
<b>This is it.</b>

12:13.190 --> 12:14.190
<b>Here it is.</b>

12:16.610 --> 12:18.940
<b>Yikes. Looks like a B-movie.</b>

12:19.020 --> 12:22.740
<b>Mr. Sakamoto. What is this place, anyway?</b>

12:22.820 --> 12:23.950
<b>They sell information.</b>

12:24.530 --> 12:27.240
<b>All information is sold in movie form.</b>

12:27.320 --> 12:29.620
<b>Why bother making them into movies?</b>

12:29.700 --> 12:32.040
<b>Come, the screening room's over here.</b>

12:35.790 --> 12:39.130
<b><i>Dondenkai is a hit man organization</i>

<b><i>That's a nice building.</i></b>

<b><i>Let's make this our headquarters.</i></b>

12:47.680 --> 12:49.890
<b><i>-Agreed!</i>
-So that's their headquarters.</b>

<b>That was such a good movie!</b>

<b>Man, what a plot twist.

13:05.530 --> 13:07.570
<b>Director Kanaguri did it again.</b>

13:08.780 --> 13:11.790
<b>That'll be 756,000 yen.</b>

13:11.870 --> 13:12.870
<b>-So pricey!

<b>I've told you everything I can.</b>

13:43.400 --> 13:47.030
<b>Yo, I heard you met with Sakamoto.

<b>What? Sakamoto?</b>

13:49.410 --> 13:52.450
<b>What a blast from the past.

<b>Don't play dumb with me.</b>

<b>I must say,</b>

15:03.810 --> 15:05.820
<b>Maybe he's busy?</b>

15:05.900 --> 15:08.780
<b>Doubt it. I bet he's forgotten.</b>

15:08.860 --> 15:10.360
<b>He's practically a fossil.</b>

15:10.450 --> 15:14.280
<b>Recently, someone has been going around</b>

15:14.370 --> 15:18.620
<b>butchering hit men in the JAA,
one after another.</b>

15:18.700 --> 15:24.250
<b>The JAA wishes to request your services
to take care of the matter immediately,</b>

15:24.960 --> 15:27.210
<b><i>in the name of The Order.</i></b>

15:28.460 --> 15:30.630
<b>This is Dondenkai HQ.</b>

15:30.720 --> 15:33.180
<b>Let's avoid combat as much as possible.</b>

15:35.930 --> 15:37.720
<b>Time for a stealth mission.</b>

15:39.220 --> 15:41.730
<b>Hey, did you hear about Sakamoto?</b>

15:41.810 --> 15:44.360
<b>Yeah. Crazy bounty, right?</b>

15:44.440 --> 15:46.610
<b>I heard that he got Boiled.</b>

15:46.690 --> 15:50.240
<b>Seriously? Not even Boiled could do it?</b>

15:53.280 --> 15:55.370
<b>I won't be pushing my luck.</b>

16:03.080 --> 16:05.000
<b>We're in.</b>

16:05.080 --> 16:06.750
<b>You're taking it off?</b>

16:06.840 --> 16:07.960
<b>Got bored of it.</b>

16:08.050 --> 16:09.670
<b>Where is this "boss" anyway?</b>

16:10.300 --> 16:13.510
<b>Were you not paying attention
to that expensive movie?</b>

16:14.590 --> 16:16.640
<b>The boss's room is on the top floor.</b>

16:16.720 --> 16:19.060
<b>We have to climb up
from the second-floor window.</b>

16:19.140 --> 16:20.720
<b>Like in the movie, remember?</b>

16:20.810 --> 16:22.690
<b>Right, Mr. Sakamoto?</b>

16:22.770 --> 16:24.060
<b><i>I fell asleep.</i></b>

16:48.590 --> 16:51.300
<b>This is fun. It's kinda like we're spies.</b>

16:51.380 --> 16:53.130
<b>You idiot, we're not here to play.</b>

16:53.220 --> 16:54.090
<b>HAVING A BLAST</b>

16:58.510 --> 16:59.850
<b>Something's off, Mr. Sakamoto.</b>

16:59.930 --> 17:02.850
<b>I can't hear any enemies on this floor.</b>

17:03.930 --> 17:05.600
<b><i>What a useless detector.</i></b>

17:05.690 --> 17:08.110
<b>I can hear <i>you,</i> you know!</b>

17:10.320 --> 17:11.150
<b>This is it.</b>

17:29.000 --> 17:30.750
<b>Hi, Sakamoto.</b>

17:31.550 --> 17:32.460
<b>Nagumo?</b>

17:33.550 --> 17:35.630
<b>You caught me red-handed.</b>

17:35.720 --> 17:37.010
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

17:37.590 --> 17:41.470
<b>Everyone in Dondenkai's upper management,
including the boss…</b>

17:42.810 --> 17:44.600
<b>has been killed by me.</b>

17:45.770 --> 17:50.520
<b>Sorry Sakamoto, but you have to die too.</b>

17:58.110 --> 17:58.950
<b><i>He's so fast!</i></b>

18:01.450 --> 18:02.660
<b>Shin!</b>

18:11.090 --> 18:13.670
<b>Just kidding! You should see your faces.</b>

18:14.380 --> 18:15.590
<b>I'm sorry, guys.</b>

18:15.670 --> 18:17.630
<b>I had an errand of my own.</b>

18:17.720 --> 18:20.550
<b>By the time I got here,
they had all been wiped out.</b>

18:20.640 --> 18:22.350
<b>Why didn't you just say so?!</b>

18:22.430 --> 18:24.310
<b>You're such a jerk!</b>

18:24.390 --> 18:25.350
<b>Why are you here?</b>

18:25.970 --> 18:27.680
<b>I guess I'd call it research.</b>

18:28.310 --> 18:31.730
<b>There have been
a lot of hits on hit men recently.</b>

18:31.810 --> 18:34.690
<b>What's so special about that?</b>

18:34.780 --> 18:38.200
<b>Sure, if it were just little quarrels
between hit men,</b>

18:38.280 --> 18:40.200
<b>no one would bat an eye.</b>

18:40.820 --> 18:45.040
<b>But over 100 hit men from organizations
close to the JAA</b>

18:45.120 --> 18:47.960
<b>have been murdered cruelly
in the last few months.</b>

18:48.040 --> 18:50.670
<b>It's obvious they're sending a message
to the JAA.</b>

18:50.750 --> 18:52.880
<b>One hundred hit men?</b>

18:52.960 --> 18:55.300
<b>But that's a quarter
of all professional hit men.</b>

18:55.380 --> 18:58.840
<b>They always leave an X at the scene,</b>

18:58.920 --> 19:01.470
<b>so we've been calling them "X" or "Slur."</b>

19:01.550 --> 19:02.930
<b>We?</b>

19:03.010 --> 19:04.560
<b>The Order has been assigned?</b>

19:04.640 --> 19:05.470
<b>Yep.</b>

19:05.560 --> 19:08.810
<b>The guy with the silver hair
was talking about that too.</b>

19:08.890 --> 19:10.140
<b>What is "The Order"?</b>

19:10.230 --> 19:12.810
<b>A special task unit for the JAA.</b>

19:13.730 --> 19:15.940
<b><i>The best of the best among hit men.</i></b>

19:16.440 --> 19:21.160
<b><i>We report directly to the JAA and take on</i>
<i>hits on particularly dangerous hit men.</i></b>

19:21.240 --> 19:23.990
<b><i>We maintain order in the world of hit men.</i></b>

19:24.070 --> 19:27.080
<b>Sakamoto used to be in The Order, too.</b>

19:29.580 --> 19:31.120
<b><i>I had no idea.</i></b>

19:31.670 --> 19:33.080
<b>Anyway, Sakamoto,</b>

19:33.630 --> 19:36.130
<b>you should all be careful of X.</b>

19:36.210 --> 19:38.510
<b>We're not hit men anymore.</b>

19:38.590 --> 19:40.340
<b>They don't have anything to do with us.</b>

19:40.420 --> 19:41.510
<b>That's right.</b>

19:41.590 --> 19:44.050
<b>We've already got our hands full
with the stupid bounty.</b>

19:44.760 --> 19:47.390
<b>I don't know much either, but…</b>

19:47.470 --> 19:49.220
<b>there is one thing I can tell you.</b>

19:49.980 --> 19:52.480
<b>These hits on hit men started</b>

19:52.560 --> 19:58.110
<b>right around the time
Sakamoto's bounty was posted.</b>

20:01.950 --> 20:02.780
<b>LEARN TO DRAW</b>

20:02.860 --> 20:04.360
<b>"When looking with both eyes,</b>

20:04.950 --> 20:08.660
<b>humans unconsciously correct
what they're seeing based on the angle."</b>

20:09.620 --> 20:12.920
<b>"Always take a step back to check</b>

20:13.000 --> 20:14.790
<b>that your drawing is symmetrical."</b>

20:16.540 --> 20:17.380
<b>Indeed.</b>

20:17.880 --> 20:20.130
<b>It may be slightly off-balance.</b>

20:21.170 --> 20:22.010
<b>SAKAMOTO'S</b>

20:22.090 --> 20:23.380
<b>We did all that,</b>

20:23.470 --> 20:25.640
<b>and we're back to square one.</b>

20:26.390 --> 20:27.640
<b>Listen up!</b>

20:27.720 --> 20:29.810
<b>-Where's Sakamoto?
-Another one?</b>

20:29.890 --> 20:31.480
<b>-I'll kill him!
-Getting a lot today.</b>

20:31.560 --> 20:32.730
<b>This one?</b>

20:32.810 --> 20:35.730
<b>No, the one right next to it.</b>

20:36.360 --> 20:38.520
<b>Sakamoto--</b>

20:39.360 --> 20:42.740
<b>We can't keep having
all these hit men dropping in.</b>

20:42.820 --> 20:45.990
<b>Who knew it'd be so hard
to get a bounty called off…</b>

20:46.070 --> 20:47.160
<b>Then again,</b>

20:47.240 --> 20:50.290
<b>bandage and band-aid sales are up,
so I guess it's okay.</b>

20:51.040 --> 20:52.330
<b><i>That makes it okay?</i></b>

20:52.410 --> 20:54.460
<b>Here, I have a band-aid for you.</b>

20:54.540 --> 20:56.330
<b>Thank you, little girl…</b>

20:56.420 --> 20:58.040
<b>Your daddy's so strong.</b>

20:58.670 --> 20:59.590
<b><i>Sakamoto,</i></b>

21:00.380 --> 21:02.550
<b>if you were neck and neck with Boiled,</b>

21:02.630 --> 21:04.720
<b>you're in for a world of hurt.</b>

21:04.800 --> 21:07.970
<b>It seems those five years
made a bigger dent than you thought.</b>

21:09.050 --> 21:13.180
<b>Since we don't know who the enemy is,
all we can do right now</b>

21:13.270 --> 21:16.140
<b>is become stronger
so we're prepared for any attack.</b>

21:16.900 --> 21:18.440
<b>Right. Make a full recovery.</b>

21:22.570 --> 21:23.780
<b>So fast!</b>

21:24.950 --> 21:25.780
<b>Welcome!</b>

21:29.490 --> 21:30.620
<b>Your items, miss!</b>

21:30.700 --> 21:32.160
<b>What? Ew!</b>

21:33.160 --> 21:34.580
<b>For my training,</b>

21:34.660 --> 21:36.420
<b>I'll drink myself stupid!</b>

21:40.290 --> 21:41.170
<b>Pork bun, please.</b>

21:41.250 --> 21:42.340
<b>Comin' right up!</b>

21:42.420 --> 21:43.630
<b>Lu!</b>

21:43.710 --> 21:45.920
<b><i>How… did she know?</i></b>

21:46.010 --> 21:50.140
<b>Hey, mister? Looks like you've got blood
gushing out of your forehead.</b>

21:50.970 --> 21:52.930
<b>Shin, what do we do?</b>

21:53.020 --> 21:54.810
<b>He's thinking bandage. Here!</b>

21:54.890 --> 21:55.930
<b>Shin…</b>
