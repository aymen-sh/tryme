00:11.090 --> 00:13.130
<b>Now we can finally talk...</b>

00:13.970 --> 00:15.140
<b>Higan.</b>

00:16.050 --> 00:18.930
<b>I've made sure this call
can't be intercepted by anyone.</b>

00:19.560 --> 00:21.180
<b>Don't worry.</b>

00:21.600 --> 00:22.810
<b>Who is this?</b>

00:22.890 --> 00:24.890
<b>I can't tell you that yet.</b>

00:24.980 --> 00:26.190
<b>Yet?</b>

00:26.600 --> 00:28.730
<b>You're heading for AUZA city, right?</b>

00:29.900 --> 00:33.030
<b>The whole place is protected
by a multi-layered security system.</b>

00:33.280 --> 00:35.240
<b>It's going to be impossible for you</b>

00:35.320 --> 00:37.570
<b>to get past that and find
a way into the city alone.</b>

00:38.450 --> 00:39.660
<b>Let me help you.</b>

00:40.330 --> 00:43.080
<b>You really think I would trust you?</b>

00:43.370 --> 00:46.920
<b>"Learning about others, but letting them
learn nothing of you in the process,</b>

00:47.000 --> 00:50.050
<b>that is the true essence
of a ninja's cunning."</b>

00:50.840 --> 00:53.380
<b>That verse... a ninja poem...</b>

00:53.470 --> 00:56.090
<b>You and I are in similar circumstances.</b>

00:56.840 --> 00:58.180
<b>An exiled ninja?</b>

00:58.680 --> 01:00.180
<b>If you want to fulfill your objective,</b>

01:00.260 --> 01:03.020
<b>then await contact from me
at the location that I'm about to send.</b>

01:03.100 --> 01:05.850
<b>Whether or not I'm worthy of trust
is up to you.</b>

02:52.000 --> 02:53.710
<b>Aren't you going to answer?</b>

02:53.790 --> 02:55.050
<b>It's just my wife.</b>

02:55.130 --> 02:57.210
<b>Gotta stay focused
on the investigation right now.</b>

02:57.460 --> 03:01.050
<b>But we don't even know if
that eyewitness report is legit or not.</b>

03:20.030 --> 03:22.450
<b>They say the guy was asleep at the wheel.</b>

03:24.120 --> 03:26.580
<b>I've been calling you nonstop.</b>

03:28.040 --> 03:30.410
<b>I thought I could handle the challenges...</b>

03:31.160 --> 03:33.330
<b>of marrying and having a family
with an FBI agent!</b>

03:33.420 --> 03:35.290
<b>But I was wrong!</b>

03:54.600 --> 03:56.230
<b>How are you feeling?</b>

03:57.320 --> 03:59.280
<b>Christ! You almost gave me a heart attack!</b>

03:59.360 --> 04:00.490
<b>Goddamn it, Duck!</b>

04:04.950 --> 04:07.030
<b>Claimed they're gonna help, huh?</b>

04:07.530 --> 04:11.660
<b>But how can you be sure this person
is really another exiled ninja like you?</b>

04:12.210 --> 04:15.670
<b>They knew a poem that was only passed down
in the old organization.</b>

04:15.750 --> 04:19.170
<b>And nobody has spoken of it
since we came to this country.</b>

04:19.250 --> 04:21.880
<b>That's enough to win your trust?</b>

04:21.970 --> 04:24.510
<b>Well, this mystery person
knows what they're talking about.</b>

04:24.590 --> 04:28.050
<b>The complexity of AUZA city's
security system is no joke.</b>

04:28.140 --> 04:31.390
<b>Like, I'm pretty sure only a literal ghost
could get past it.</b>

04:31.470 --> 04:33.940
<b>Fine, but what if it's a trap?</b>

04:35.100 --> 04:36.480
<b>Then I'll simply kill them.</b>

04:36.560 --> 04:38.610
<b>Don't just tell me
you're off to commit murder!</b>

04:38.690 --> 04:40.820
<b>Remember that our alliance
is only temporary.</b>

04:43.280 --> 04:46.070
<b>So, how do we get into the city?</b>

04:46.160 --> 04:50.290
<b>Considering my last chat with the chief,
they've probably got eyes on me already.</b>

04:50.370 --> 04:53.620
<b>Oh yeah, there's no doubt about that.
Let's just call it quits.</b>

04:53.710 --> 04:54.660
<b>Come on.</b>

04:54.750 --> 04:59.540
<b>You're the one who said the best way
to get a lead on AUZA was to hit their HQ.</b>

04:59.630 --> 05:01.300
<b>And I agree with you on that.</b>

05:01.380 --> 05:03.590
<b>But I never said it was possible.</b>

05:03.670 --> 05:05.470
<b>Well, there's gotta be some way...</b>

05:05.550 --> 05:06.800
<b>Nope. Can't be done.</b>

05:08.470 --> 05:11.430
<b>However, I've picked up on another lead.</b>

05:11.510 --> 05:12.310
<b>Really?!</b>

05:13.430 --> 05:16.640
<b>There's this community of users on the
dark web who've been keeping tabs</b>

05:16.730 --> 05:18.270
<b>on AUZA's actions.</b>

05:18.360 --> 05:20.270
<b>They claim that AUZA is plotting
to take over the world,</b>

05:20.360 --> 05:23.230
<b>and that they're building weapons
of mass destruction.</b>

05:23.320 --> 05:25.740
<b>So they're another bunch
of loony conspiracy theorists.</b>

05:25.820 --> 05:28.450
<b>But why go out of the way
to put it on the dark web?</b>

05:30.580 --> 05:32.990
<b>Better safe than sorry, I guess.</b>

05:33.330 --> 05:35.210
<b>I've pinned down the location
of the site admin</b>

05:35.290 --> 05:37.000
<b>who claims to be
a former researcher at AUZA.</b>

05:37.080 --> 05:38.250
<b>Great.</b>

05:38.330 --> 05:40.170
<b>He's pretty far away from here, though.</b>

05:40.250 --> 05:42.710
<b>Not an issue. I'll be going it alone.</b>

05:43.250 --> 05:43.880
<b>What?</b>

05:43.960 --> 05:45.840
<b>You've done enough.</b>

05:46.340 --> 05:50.510
<b>This here is a job for old-timers like me
who've got nothing left to lose.</b>

05:51.510 --> 05:55.430
<b>There's no way I'm letting you
hog all the glory on this.</b>

05:55.520 --> 05:56.520
<b>Huh?</b>

05:56.810 --> 05:59.850
<b>We're on the verge of uncovering
AUZA's dirty secrets.</b>

06:00.270 --> 06:03.570
<b>And with any luck, we may get our hands
on some of their cutting-edge data!</b>

06:03.650 --> 06:05.070
<b>That stuff could be worth thousands!</b>

06:05.150 --> 06:08.780
<b>No! I would go as far as to say
millions of dollars!</b>

06:08.860 --> 06:10.410
<b>Seriously...?</b>

06:10.490 --> 06:13.240
<b>That's the deal.
We're still in this together.</b>

06:13.330 --> 06:14.580
<b>Stay on your toes.</b>

06:15.450 --> 06:17.500
<b>Mind if I ask you something?</b>

06:17.960 --> 06:20.960
<b>Did your wife know what you really were
before she died?</b>

06:21.040 --> 06:22.500
<b>She did.</b>

06:22.960 --> 06:24.880
<b>Because Mari was also a ninja.</b>

06:25.170 --> 06:27.800
<b>Do ninjas normally have families?</b>

06:27.880 --> 06:31.470
<b>No. The two of us broke the code.</b>

06:31.760 --> 06:32.970
<b>What code?</b>

06:33.430 --> 06:36.640
<b>Ninjas must be emotionally detached,
even from their allies.</b>

06:47.070 --> 06:51.200
<b>I see... so you chose your family instead.</b>

06:56.160 --> 06:57.700
<b>That's fantastic!</b>

06:57.790 --> 07:00.120
<b>He's quite the fighter, isn't he?</b>

07:00.370 --> 07:03.210
<b>We have data showing that just one
of those mass-produced units alone</b>

07:03.290 --> 07:05.630
<b>can destroy an entire army platoon,</b>

07:05.710 --> 07:07.340
<b>but it wasn't even a match for him!</b>

07:07.420 --> 07:08.630
<b>I know what you mean.</b>

07:08.720 --> 07:11.720
<b>You're just itching for a chance
to screw the guy, right?</b>

07:11.800 --> 07:12.970
<b>Uh, no.</b>

07:13.050 --> 07:14.760
<b>Please don't put me down
on your vulgar level.</b>

07:14.850 --> 07:15.680
<b>Huh?</b>

07:16.010 --> 07:18.180
<b>I'm a businessman, you see.</b>

07:18.270 --> 07:21.770
<b>I don't do any fighting,
nor do I want any victories.</b>

07:21.850 --> 07:23.150
<b>I'm only after data!</b>

07:23.230 --> 07:26.610
<b>What happens if he shows up?
You just gonna bend over for him?</b>

07:26.690 --> 07:29.280
<b>Well, that's what my
talented secretary is here for.</b>

07:29.360 --> 07:30.360
<b>Isn't that right?</b>

07:30.450 --> 07:31.240
<b>Correct.</b>

07:31.320 --> 07:32.400
<b>Hey, Dilly!</b>

07:32.490 --> 07:35.200
<b>What kinda techniques
did he use to tame you like that?</b>

07:35.280 --> 07:36.280
<b>Sir.</b>

07:36.370 --> 07:39.370
<b>Do I have your permission to
share the details of your techniques</b>

07:39.450 --> 07:40.710
<b>with this sick bastard?</b>

07:40.790 --> 07:43.790
<b>Let's not. Also, watch your language.</b>

07:43.880 --> 07:45.500
<b>My apologies, sir.</b>

07:47.300 --> 07:49.260
<b>So, does anybody have a plan?</b>

07:49.340 --> 07:51.420
<b>You must realize that he's headed here.</b>

07:51.720 --> 07:53.550
<b>No need for concern.</b>

07:53.640 --> 07:56.550
<b>The city's defenses are 100% impenetrable.</b>

07:56.640 --> 07:58.140
<b>Wait, hold on!</b>

07:58.220 --> 08:03.650
<b>You mustn't say something
like "100%" so casually, Aska.</b>

08:03.730 --> 08:05.480
<b>Probability is-</b>

08:06.150 --> 08:07.770
<b>Uh, pardon me.</b>

08:07.860 --> 08:09.860
<b>Big D, are you listening?</b>

08:10.570 --> 08:13.990
<b>Let me just say my hair
is looking super-fly today.</b>

08:14.070 --> 08:17.740
<b>And if this ninja dares
to ruin even one strand of it...</b>

08:18.240 --> 08:19.160
<b>he's dead meat.</b>

08:19.240 --> 08:22.250
<b>Hah! Are you talking about
the bush down by your d-</b>

08:32.300 --> 08:34.340
<b>Enough idle chatter.</b>

08:36.550 --> 08:40.020
<b>We already know Higan
is a force not to be trifled with.</b>

08:40.970 --> 08:42.600
<b>So the plan remains the same.</b>

08:43.350 --> 08:46.230
<b>We must learn how his technique works
in order to eliminate him.</b>

08:49.730 --> 08:51.480
<b>And what about his FBI friend?</b>

08:51.820 --> 08:53.490
<b>He is powerless.</b>

08:54.150 --> 08:56.870
<b>We can deal with him
if he ever becomes an issue.</b>

08:57.280 --> 09:01.080
<b>Don't make this any more complicated
than it needs to be.</b>

09:01.750 --> 09:04.910
<b>You're not my boss. Don't order me around!</b>

09:06.830 --> 09:09.290
<b>But I agree with your assessment.</b>

09:13.630 --> 09:15.050
<b>Hey, Dilly.</b>

09:15.510 --> 09:17.800
<b>How far do you think that ninja will get?</b>

09:18.180 --> 09:19.970
<b>Are you concerned?</b>

09:20.060 --> 09:21.890
<b>No, I'm excited!</b>

09:21.970 --> 09:25.690
<b>Why do you think I joined forces
with you guys in the first place?</b>

09:26.190 --> 09:28.690
<b>I have my fingers crossed that
we can finally get some decent data</b>

09:28.770 --> 09:30.190
<b>on the prototype now.</b>

09:30.900 --> 09:32.940
<b>Hope he doesn't die too quickly.</b>

09:34.320 --> 09:37.610
<b>Just say the word, and I will
terminate him in the blink of an eye.</b>

09:37.700 --> 09:39.740
<b>You aren't going anywhere.</b>

09:39.820 --> 09:41.450
<b>I'll just throw the others at Higan</b>

09:41.530 --> 09:44.120
<b>until he is forced to reveal
the secrets of his technique.</b>

09:44.200 --> 09:46.960
<b>Their deaths wouldn't
be much of a setback.</b>

09:47.460 --> 09:51.630
<b>And in any case, it's only a matter of
time before the suit is completed.</b>

09:55.340 --> 09:59.510
<b>We of the ninja clan are bound
by the code, protected by the code,</b>

09:59.590 --> 10:02.060
<b>and kept alive by the code!</b>

10:02.350 --> 10:06.230
<b>Therefore, it is our destiny
to die by the code!</b>

10:06.310 --> 10:09.650
<b>Our destiny is to die by the code!</b>

10:09.900 --> 10:13.320
<b>One: The secrets of the ninja
must never be divulged!</b>

10:13.400 --> 10:16.320
<b>The secrets of the ninja
must never be divulged!</b>

10:16.400 --> 10:19.570
<b>Two: Ninjas must be emotionally detached,
even from their allies!</b>

10:19.860 --> 10:22.450
<b>Ninjas must be emotionally detached,
even from their allies!</b>

10:22.530 --> 10:26.620
<b>Three: The mission must always
take precedence over your life!</b>

10:26.710 --> 10:29.830
<b>The mission must always
take precedence over your life!</b>

10:29.920 --> 10:31.500
<b>W-wait!</b>

10:59.450 --> 11:00.700
<b>As per tradition,</b>

11:00.780 --> 11:03.410
<b>you three will now be given ninja names</b>

11:03.490 --> 11:05.740
<b>in recognition of your
outstanding skill as shinobi.</b>

11:06.290 --> 11:07.370
<b>Higan.</b>

11:07.910 --> 11:08.910
<b>Zai.</b>

11:09.410 --> 11:10.620
<b>Mari.</b>

11:10.710 --> 11:12.540
<b>Those are your names henceforth.</b>

11:12.630 --> 11:13.750
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

11:13.840 --> 11:16.590
<b>And that is not all you will be receiving.</b>

11:17.460 --> 11:20.720
<b>A secret art shall be
passed down to each of you.</b>

11:22.300 --> 11:24.970
<b>This technique is to be
kept only to yourself</b>

11:25.060 --> 11:27.310
<b>and must never
be revealed to others.</b>

11:28.100 --> 11:29.270
<b>Are we clear?</b>

11:29.350 --> 11:30.390
<b>Yes, sir!</b>

11:31.190 --> 11:34.860
<b>The missions that you take from now on
will be filled with even greater danger.</b>

11:35.360 --> 11:37.900
<b>However, the three of you are ninjas</b>

11:37.980 --> 11:41.150
<b>with both skill and strength
that is unrivaled within our clan.</b>

11:41.240 --> 11:45.240
<b>I firmly believe you will be the ones
who lead our village in the future.</b>

11:51.290 --> 11:53.630
<b>We have our own ninja names now.</b>

11:53.710 --> 11:56.920
<b>I like them all.
They have a nice ring to them.</b>

11:58.000 --> 11:59.380
<b>"Higan"...</b>

12:00.510 --> 12:02.470
<b>I find the idea hard to get used to.</b>

12:02.930 --> 12:04.550
<b>Names are the proof that we exist.</b>

12:04.640 --> 12:06.760
<b>Now we'll always be able
to remember each other.</b>

12:07.060 --> 12:10.810
<b>In that case, let's be candid
and share a moment of joy.</b>

12:10.890 --> 12:12.690
<b>Just don't go sharing your secret art.</b>

12:12.770 --> 12:14.270
<b>Of course.</b>

12:14.400 --> 12:17.230
<b>It'll be a surprise if we ever end up
fighting one another.</b>

12:19.230 --> 12:24.030
<b>If you ask me,
our bonds are thicker than blood.</b>

12:25.070 --> 12:27.330
<b>We never know when death will come.</b>

12:27.620 --> 12:29.580
<b>This here is proof
of our shared experiences,</b>

12:29.660 --> 12:31.660
<b>proof of our discussions,</b>

12:31.750 --> 12:34.080
<b>and proof of our pact.</b>

12:34.170 --> 12:35.420
<b>What pact?</b>

12:35.750 --> 12:39.460
<b>That we risk our lives together,
to do what must be done.</b>

13:35.310 --> 13:36.270
<b>Just go!</b>

14:20.610 --> 14:22.270
<b>Just leave me behind.</b>

14:24.440 --> 14:25.610
<b>No.</b>

14:42.090 --> 14:44.960
<b>The mission will be a failure
at this rate!</b>

14:45.630 --> 14:47.380
<b>I'm not going back alone.</b>

14:47.470 --> 14:49.090
<b>Remember the code.</b>

14:49.180 --> 14:51.800
<b>We must be detached, even from allies.</b>

14:51.890 --> 14:53.560
<b>From the moment I met you...</b>

14:54.970 --> 14:57.270
<b>I had already broken the code.</b>

15:27.170 --> 15:28.380
<b>You two okay?!</b>

15:50.860 --> 15:53.820
<b>Please leave your message after the beep.</b>

15:55.580 --> 15:59.040
<b>Jeez, Duck. You never pick up, do ya?</b>

15:59.620 --> 16:02.210
<b>I'm on my way to the intel source now.</b>

16:02.750 --> 16:04.250
<b>I'll call again later.</b>

16:09.130 --> 16:09.960
<b>Yeah?</b>

16:10.050 --> 16:12.050
<b>Why didn't you report about
your discharge from the hospital?</b>

16:12.130 --> 16:14.090
<b>Nothing gets past this guy, I swear.</b>

16:14.430 --> 16:16.930
<b>You can just leave the get-well gift
on my desk, sir.</b>

16:17.010 --> 16:19.270
<b>I'll come pick it up on retirement day.</b>

16:19.600 --> 16:23.060
<b>You can do whatever you want since
you're not assigned to any investigations,</b>

16:23.140 --> 16:25.110
<b>but your partner is another story.</b>

16:27.860 --> 16:28.980
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

16:29.070 --> 16:30.490
<b>What are you apologizing for?</b>

16:30.570 --> 16:33.280
<b>Obeying the top brass
is just part of the job.</b>

16:33.360 --> 16:34.160
<b>But I-</b>

16:34.240 --> 16:35.530
<b>To tell the truth,</b>

16:35.620 --> 16:38.740
<b>I've been racking my brain
to figure out how best to ditch you.</b>

16:38.830 --> 16:40.250
<b>So don't worry about it.</b>

16:41.750 --> 16:43.920
<b>Say, are you feeling hungry at all?</b>

16:44.000 --> 16:44.870
<b>Huh?</b>

16:45.170 --> 16:49.590
<b>"No army fights on an empty stomach."
It's a Japanese proverb.</b>

17:01.350 --> 17:02.930
<b>You've made the right choice.</b>

17:03.020 --> 17:03.890
<b>Now what?</b>

17:03.980 --> 17:05.100
<b>Don't be hasty.</b>

17:05.190 --> 17:08.520
<b>First, I need you to understand exactly
how the city's security system works.</b>

17:09.270 --> 17:12.780
<b>The entirety of AUZA city is guarded
by a security system that consists</b>

17:12.860 --> 17:15.610
<b>only of their independently
developed technology.</b>

17:16.780 --> 17:19.490
<b>Sensors are equipped
along the whole perimeter</b>

17:19.580 --> 17:21.830
<b>to check ahead of time if
those approaching have permission</b>

17:21.910 --> 17:23.080
<b>to enter the city.</b>

17:24.370 --> 17:27.920
<b>And if any uninvited guests
do not heed the warnings that get issued,</b>

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
<b>the system will open fire on them.</b>

17:31.960 --> 17:33.800
<b>Furthermore, the airspace above the city</b>

17:33.880 --> 17:36.930
<b>is fully covered by a honeycomb-shaped
electromagnetic barrier,</b>

17:37.890 --> 17:40.100
<b>which only allows rain and wind
to pass through.</b>

17:41.060 --> 17:43.480
<b>Entering from above ground is impossible.</b>

17:44.810 --> 17:46.940
<b>So you'll pass through the
underground facility</b>

17:47.020 --> 17:49.060
<b>that they use to manage
the sensors instead.</b>

17:49.560 --> 17:52.530
<b>I'll send you coordinates for the entrance
and a map of the facility shortly.</b>

17:53.230 --> 17:57.360
<b>There are various security cameras
and laser traps inside of the facility,</b>

17:57.610 --> 17:59.950
<b>as well as mercenaries from
private military companies</b>

18:00.030 --> 18:01.160
<b>who patrol each section.</b>

18:01.950 --> 18:05.290
<b>To make sure the plan goes smoothly,
you must avoid any and all combat.</b>

18:06.500 --> 18:10.000
<b>Make it past them and you'll reach the
electro-magnetic barrier into the city,</b>

18:10.090 --> 18:13.170
<b>I'll shut off the power and open it
for 5 seconds when you arrive.</b>

18:13.630 --> 18:15.840
<b>Any longer and it can't be written off
as an error.</b>

18:16.630 --> 18:19.760
<b>We begin after the sun goes down.
You only get once chance.</b>

18:19.840 --> 18:21.180
<b>Just those 5 seconds.</b>

18:21.260 --> 18:22.890
<b>No problem.</b>

18:26.140 --> 18:28.400
<b>Now that was tasty!</b>

18:29.020 --> 18:30.730
<b>Hope you got your fill.</b>

18:30.810 --> 18:33.110
<b>Now I'm ready to fight whenever.</b>

18:36.240 --> 18:39.570
<b>Oh, right.
I'll send you a picture of our target.</b>

18:41.490 --> 18:43.080
<b>Jason Cardenas.</b>

18:43.160 --> 18:45.410
<b>Hopefully he hasn't changed
his appearance.</b>

18:45.500 --> 18:47.750
<b>I'd be able to tell regardless.</b>

18:47.830 --> 18:50.330
<b>Really? How, exactly?</b>

18:50.420 --> 18:52.460
<b>I'll teach you the trick another time.</b>

18:53.170 --> 18:54.340
<b>Come to think of it,</b>

18:54.420 --> 18:57.550
<b>this is the first investigation where
we'll be working apart from each other.</b>

18:57.630 --> 18:58.970
<b>You better pull your weight.</b>

18:59.050 --> 19:01.140
<b>Play it safe out there, Mike.</b>

19:01.220 --> 19:03.560
<b>You may not be the perfect mentor,
but I owe you a lot.</b>

19:04.100 --> 19:05.890
<b>Don't get all sappy on me now.</b>

19:09.480 --> 19:10.560
<b>Another cup o' joe!</b>

19:10.650 --> 19:11.690
<b>Again?</b>

19:11.770 --> 19:13.860
<b>You're going to end up addicted
to caffeine at this rate.</b>

19:13.940 --> 19:17.610
<b>What's your deal?
Quit making it sound like I'm gonna die.</b>

19:17.690 --> 19:20.700
<b>All I'm trying to say
is that I need you in good health.</b>

19:21.200 --> 19:24.120
<b>Because there's still a lot
for me to learn from you.</b>

19:24.200 --> 19:26.540
<b>Hope you don't mind keeping me
under your wing!</b>

19:29.330 --> 19:30.670
<b>Actually, make it water.</b>

19:42.430 --> 19:44.970
<b>I've hacked all their
internal surveillance cameras.</b>

19:45.390 --> 19:49.060
<b>We have 8 minutes before they notice.
Get through the facility before then.</b>

19:50.230 --> 19:51.560
<b>I'm going in.</b>

19:57.190 --> 19:59.400
<b>All of their patrol routes
and inspection points</b>

19:59.490 --> 20:00.820
<b>are set on a rigid schedule.</b>

20:01.240 --> 20:02.700
<b>Move exactly as I instruct you to.</b>

20:10.960 --> 20:11.870
<b>Now.</b>

20:16.670 --> 20:17.960
<b>Head for the room across the hall.</b>

20:29.020 --> 20:31.810
<b>The laser trap ahead
changes patterns every two seconds.</b>

20:32.230 --> 20:35.150
<b>This is where you'll have to put
your physical prowess to the test.</b>

20:43.530 --> 20:45.950
<b>Sensors have picked up
an intruder in Sector D!</b>

20:46.030 --> 20:47.530
<b>I repeat, intruder in Sector D!</b>

20:52.660 --> 20:53.460
<b>Don't stop.</b>

21:02.130 --> 21:03.130
<b>Turn right.</b>

21:08.100 --> 21:09.810
<b>The hallway just ahead has your way out.</b>

21:10.310 --> 21:13.640
<b>I'm cutting the power now.
The barrier will open for 5 seconds.</b>

21:24.320 --> 21:25.410
<b>Zai.</b>

21:26.530 --> 21:27.700
<b>Higan.</b>
