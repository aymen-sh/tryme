00:10.700 --> 00:12.030
Hello...?

00:12.680 --> 00:14.590
<i>Jinwoo, are you still asleep?!</i>

00:14.590 --> 00:17.200
Yeah. I was a little worn out.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.350
<i>Do you realize what time it is?</i>

00:19.350 --> 00:21.660
<i>You do remember you're supposed 
to meet with my teacher, right?</i>

00:25.200 --> 00:29.760
Uh... That is you, right, Jinwoo?

00:30.130 --> 00:32.260
What? You think it looks bad?

00:33.180 --> 00:36.640
<i>It's been over ten years since gates 
began appearing across the world.</i>

00:37.270 --> 00:40.530
<i>The battles between the magic beasts 
inhabiting the dungeons through the gates</i>

00:40.530 --> 00:45.720
<i>and the human hunters who have 
awakened the abilities to fight them</i>

00:45.720 --> 00:47.820
<i>show no signs of ending.</i>

00:48.980 --> 00:51.980
<i>Sung Jinwoo, looking to earn enough money</i>

00:51.980 --> 00:54.770
<i>to provide for his sick mother 
and his student sister,</i>

00:55.180 --> 00:59.230
<i>started working as a hunter 
of the lowest possible level: E-Rank.</i>

00:59.910 --> 01:03.510
<i>In most cases, a Hunter's powers do not 
change from the moment of their awakening,</i>

01:03.510 --> 01:06.150
<i>and nor does their rank.</i>

01:06.460 --> 01:10.410
<i>However, during a raid on a 
double dungeon, Sung Jinwoo</i>

01:10.410 --> 01:16.100
<i>gained the ability to level up 
as though in a video game.</i>

01:16.850 --> 01:20.160
<i>As he grew stronger in battle, 
he obtained the recipe</i>

01:20.160 --> 01:24.420
<i>for the Elixir of Life, said to 
be able to cure any disease,</i>

01:24.420 --> 01:30.480
<i>as well as a new job class allowing him to 
command an army of shadows: shadow monarch.</i>

03:01.990 --> 03:05.070
Not exactly bad, but...

03:05.070 --> 03:07.870
Well, it's not like I can meet 
with your teacher in a tracksuit.

03:09.090 --> 03:11.710
People sure can transform, huh?

03:13.170 --> 03:14.880
Oh my gosh, who is that?!

03:15.190 --> 03:17.290
Wow, you're the center of attention.

03:17.290 --> 03:20.290
You don't have a girlfriend, right? 
Want me to make some introductions?

03:21.560 --> 03:22.560
Pipe down.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.850
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

03:25.810 --> 03:29.680
Miss Jinah is very well behaved, 
and she gets wonderful grades.

03:29.680 --> 03:33.950
She's a role model to the other students, 
which is a relief to those of us on staff.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.480
I see.

03:35.890 --> 03:37.520
Her mock exam results have been excellent,

03:37.520 --> 03:40.380
enough to qualify her for the 
medical school she's aiming for,

03:40.380 --> 03:42.930
so I only ask you not to put 
additional pressure on her.

03:42.930 --> 03:44.200
Understood.

03:44.960 --> 03:50.320
That's everything I needed to cover, 
but there was one other thing...

03:50.320 --> 03:52.170
What's that?

03:53.940 --> 04:00.130
If Jinah were to awaken, would you 
allow her to become a hunter?

04:01.690 --> 04:02.720
No.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.490
I thought so.

04:05.490 --> 04:06.440
Why do you ask?

04:07.110 --> 04:11.390
Mr. Sung, I realize 
that I'm asking a lot here...

04:17.240 --> 04:19.240
Uh...

04:22.010 --> 04:23.620
What's going on here?

04:23.950 --> 04:26.190
You recognize her?

04:26.190 --> 04:29.840
Wait... You're Jinah's brother?!

04:30.280 --> 04:32.040
Small world, isn't it?

04:34.170 --> 04:36.780
I have no idea what our teacher told you,

04:36.780 --> 04:40.410
but I'm not going back to school 
or quitting hunting.

04:40.410 --> 04:43.760
You're an E-Rank. 
You can't earn a living like that.

04:44.650 --> 04:48.210
I'm sure you made some money with our 
strike team, but that was a one-time thing.

04:48.210 --> 04:51.110
If you're here to lecture me, 
you can go home now.

04:51.110 --> 04:53.650
Besides, you're E-Rank, too, aren't you?

04:55.910 --> 04:57.950
I'm not here to tell you to stop.

04:59.460 --> 05:00.520
Come on.

05:06.570 --> 05:10.640
Welcome home, Hunter Hwang Dongsoo.

05:12.730 --> 05:15.300
Like I'd call an old-fashioned 
dump like this home.

05:15.740 --> 05:16.960
Gotta admit, I'm surprised

05:16.960 --> 05:20.880
a Hunter's Association manager 
would deign to meet me in person.

05:21.910 --> 05:24.000
How long will you be staying?

05:24.000 --> 05:28.760
I don't like this country enough 
to stick around. You can unclench.

05:29.720 --> 05:34.060
Did you come all the way back to your 
abandoned homeland to find the two of them?

05:34.680 --> 05:35.770
"Find" them?

05:35.770 --> 05:38.250
Don't ask when you already know the answer.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.460
You folks in the Surveillance Team 
can just pretend you had no idea...

05:41.460 --> 05:44.530
what I plan on doing to them inside a dungeon.

05:44.530 --> 05:47.860
First the E-Rank, and then the D-Rank.

05:48.170 --> 05:51.960
Or are you really stupid enough 
to try and stop me?

05:52.700 --> 05:55.740
A scrub like you?

05:56.940 --> 06:00.120
All I intend on doing is my job.

06:07.420 --> 06:09.560
So they had wings...

06:09.560 --> 06:14.010
The real issue is that 
the bodies fell into the sea.

06:14.010 --> 06:17.420
You're saying these beasts 
are now capable of flight?

06:18.170 --> 06:21.480
Only over short distances, 
for now, but in time...?

06:23.380 --> 06:26.780
I'll have to arrange for it 
to be looked into on this end.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.500
Manager Ahn, Mr. Hyun. 
It's good to see you again.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.220
It's been a while!

06:38.220 --> 06:41.710
I didn't expect to hear from you, Mr. Sung.

06:41.710 --> 06:43.580
What a pleasant surprise!

06:43.580 --> 06:45.000
Good evening.

06:45.420 --> 06:48.380
Hey, I remember you from the other day!

06:48.820 --> 06:50.890
Sorry to impose.

06:50.890 --> 06:53.970
Oh, not at all. 
If it's for you, Hunter Sung...

06:54.610 --> 06:58.870
I was surprised to hear you wanted to 
sit in on some training. Is it for that girl?

06:58.870 --> 06:59.690
That's right.

06:59.690 --> 07:02.220
You timed it perfectly, actually.

07:02.220 --> 07:05.750
This area has been designated 
a high-frequency gate zone.

07:05.750 --> 07:09.160
A C-Rank one opened up this morning, in fact.

07:09.160 --> 07:13.940
How long are you going to stand around 
and chat? We're not here on a field trip.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.830
Sorry about that. We're almost done.

07:15.830 --> 07:16.910
Who's that?

07:16.910 --> 07:21.850
Kim Chul, an A-Rank. 
As you can see, he's a tank.

07:21.850 --> 07:23.040
He's A-Rank...?

07:23.470 --> 07:28.040
This excursion was actually designated as a 
training experience for our younger hunters,

07:28.040 --> 07:31.810
him included. He'll be serving 
as the leader of the strike team.

07:31.810 --> 07:36.060
When we asked him about you tagging along, 
it seems to have put him in a mood...

07:35.060 --> 07:36.060
Hey!

07:36.060 --> 07:40.260
Unbelievable. Can't believe I'm stuck 
with babysitting a couple of E-Ranks.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.520
One would be bad enough, but two?

07:42.520 --> 07:49.000
Now, today's strike team will consist 
of one A-Rank, five B-Ranks,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.280
and two C-Ranks. Eight in total.

07:51.650 --> 07:55.490
With the addition of you two, 
that makes ten members.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.800
<i>I had hoped she might reconsider 
upon seeing how brutal raids can be,</i>

08:00.900 --> 08:02.600
<i>but that's a stacked lineup.</i>

08:02.600 --> 08:05.060
<i>If they succeed too easily, 
it'll defeat the purpose.</i>

08:05.060 --> 08:06.300
Hunter Sung?

08:07.750 --> 08:10.640
In order to ensure the rookie hunters 
have something to do,

08:10.640 --> 08:12.930
try to limit your participation, okay?

08:12.930 --> 08:14.610
I'll keep that in mind.

08:15.940 --> 08:17.850
Let's get underway, then.

08:17.850 --> 08:19.810
Don't have to tell me twice.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.070
Let's go, mister.

08:25.070 --> 08:26.860
I'll be right behind you.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.720
<i>Something feels off.</i>

08:42.240 --> 08:43.940
<i>This bizarre sensation...</i>

08:57.880 --> 08:59.300
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

09:01.250 --> 09:02.730
What in the world...?

09:04.180 --> 09:05.510
Hunter Sung?

09:06.270 --> 09:09.230
Manager Ahn! Contact the primary strike team!

09:09.230 --> 09:10.640
Right now!

09:12.940 --> 09:17.110
A red gate?! How did a C-Rank gate turn red?!

09:17.110 --> 09:19.590
I'm headed there right now!

09:30.510 --> 09:31.740
What happened back there?

09:31.740 --> 09:33.290
The gate's disappeared!

09:33.290 --> 09:34.970
How do we get back now?!

09:35.790 --> 09:36.930
That was a red gate.

09:39.420 --> 09:42.730
What exactly is a red gate, mister?

09:43.370 --> 09:46.840
Unlike typical gates, once you step through,

09:46.840 --> 09:49.440
it takes you to a dungeon 
completely isolated from the outside.

09:50.220 --> 09:53.960
You can't leave until the boss is defeated or a dungeon break occurs,

09:53.960 --> 09:55.740
and no one can send help from the outside.

09:57.190 --> 10:01.100
Not only that, but the magic beasts 
inside are usually stronger than normal.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.620
So if this is a C-Rank dungeon...

10:11.530 --> 10:13.280
An ambush! On your guard!

10:16.220 --> 10:18.430
Uh... Thank you.

10:18.430 --> 10:20.140
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.050
Ice elves?

10:24.050 --> 10:25.520
And they're way up there!

10:25.520 --> 10:28.890
<i>That's a lot of distance. 
Most people wouldn't have noticed.</i>

10:29.760 --> 10:32.400
<i>They went after our weakest two members...</i>

10:33.290 --> 10:35.400
<i>which would've included me, two months ago.</i>

10:43.380 --> 10:46.410
Mister... What were those?

10:46.900 --> 10:48.290
Ice elves.

10:48.290 --> 10:53.180
Though due to their cruel nature, hunters 
call them something more befitting of demons:

10:53.180 --> 10:55.210
Ice Slayers.

10:56.130 --> 10:57.590
Attention!

10:57.960 --> 11:01.350
As you know, a red gate means 
we're completely cut off from support,

11:01.350 --> 11:03.350
facing enemies of B-Rank or higher.

11:03.350 --> 11:04.620
Given the situation,

11:04.620 --> 11:08.630
I expect you to obey the highest-ranked 
hunter here in order to survive.

11:09.430 --> 11:13.240
That said, even I can't 
command all of you by myself.

11:13.650 --> 11:17.030
Which is why I'll be forming a 
second group to proceed onward.

11:17.030 --> 11:18.240
<i>What?</i>

11:18.240 --> 11:20.980
This is to raise our chances of survival!

11:20.980 --> 11:22.310
If we stand around debating,

11:22.310 --> 11:25.440
our only outcomes will be freezing to death 
or getting slaughtered!

11:26.040 --> 11:29.410
I guarantee that anyone who follows me 
will make it out of here alive!

11:29.410 --> 11:30.970
I-I'll join you.

11:30.970 --> 11:31.920
Let me go with you!

11:31.920 --> 11:33.210
M-Me, too!

11:35.160 --> 11:36.590
Not you.

11:37.260 --> 11:42.050
The girl who's here to observe, and you... 
and anyone C-Rank or lower.

11:42.470 --> 11:45.810
Every day we spend in here, 
an hour passes on the outside.

11:45.810 --> 11:48.640
Whether we end up beating the boss 
or waiting for a dungeon break,

11:49.240 --> 11:51.570
we could be here for up to several months.

11:51.570 --> 11:53.860
That's too long to spend 
looking after dead weight.

11:55.320 --> 12:00.090
Don't look so depressed. Just stay alive until
we beat the boss, and we can all go home.

12:00.090 --> 12:03.780
Excuse me. Is it okay if I join them?

12:04.990 --> 12:06.360
Suit yourself.

12:08.530 --> 12:11.710
<i>Does she pity them? What a fool.</i>

12:12.760 --> 12:15.670
Mr. Kim didn't even notice that arrow.

12:16.020 --> 12:18.380
You aren't E-Rank, are you?

12:20.670 --> 12:24.020
<i>A-Rank... or maybe even higher.</i>

12:25.850 --> 12:26.830
Good to meet you.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.520
H-Hello.

12:28.890 --> 12:29.820
Hey.

12:30.270 --> 12:32.480
We'll be taking the path through the clearing.

12:33.510 --> 12:36.320
In that case, we'll head for the woods.

12:36.770 --> 12:38.320
I wish you luck.

12:41.580 --> 12:44.260
Likewise. Be careful out there.

12:51.510 --> 12:52.710
Captain?

12:52.710 --> 12:53.740
Look.

12:55.290 --> 12:56.500
Those are...

12:57.140 --> 12:58.740
An ice bear did that.

12:58.740 --> 13:02.300
We're basically leaving 
that E-Rank's group to die.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.850
They probably haven't had 
proper training or anything.

13:05.370 --> 13:08.310
Dying after coming to observe a raid... 
Talk about rotten luck.

13:08.820 --> 13:13.820
<i>Hang on. They've got a C-Rank, 
and Park Heejin, who's a B-Rank...</i>

13:13.820 --> 13:16.490
<i>So why did I assume the 
E-Rank was their leader?</i>

13:18.810 --> 13:19.860
Get ready, people!

13:30.710 --> 13:33.670
I want all of you to focus on staying alive.

13:56.430 --> 13:57.560
Stop!

13:59.270 --> 14:00.620
What is it?

14:01.480 --> 14:03.090
That should be obvious.

14:03.090 --> 14:06.900
Look at those claw marks. 
This entire forest is ice bear territory.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.660
We should turn back before we run into any.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.600
That's exactly why we'll keep going further.

14:13.880 --> 14:18.780
If this is bear territory, we'll only need to 
worry about bears while we're inside of it.

14:19.550 --> 14:22.260
It beats dealing with an 
intelligent enemy like ice elves.

14:23.470 --> 14:28.620
<i>If ice bears can thrive here, there must be 
no stronger beasts that'd prey on them.</i>

14:29.180 --> 14:31.920
I hadn't thought that far ahead.

14:32.860 --> 14:36.280
That said, it's as cold as 
you'd expect out in the woods.

14:41.530 --> 14:42.820
I've got one for each of us.

14:42.820 --> 14:44.830
Was that summoning magic?!

14:44.830 --> 14:50.170
But even high-ranked hunters have trouble 
storing more than two or three low-level items!

14:52.830 --> 14:54.800
So warm!

14:56.210 --> 14:58.390
Seriously, mister, who are you really?

15:05.820 --> 15:09.660
I brought you in here, so it's my 
responsibility to keep you safe.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.980
All I ask is you don't ask questions.

15:15.390 --> 15:17.060
That goes for the two of you, as well.

15:18.040 --> 15:22.020
Don't ask me about anything, or for anything.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.460
Change title.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.480
It's sealed shut.

15:43.910 --> 15:48.800
If we're lucky, a few of the A and 
B-Ranks will make it back alive...

15:49.990 --> 15:52.980
It's all going to depend on Hunter Kim.

15:54.110 --> 15:58.060
There's actually someone else 
who accompanied our strike team.

15:58.650 --> 16:02.520
His name is Sung Jinwoo. 
He caught my eye recently, and—

16:02.520 --> 16:03.400
What's his rank?

16:04.660 --> 16:06.180
E-Rank, sir.

16:06.180 --> 16:09.080
But I suspect he might have reawakened!

16:09.550 --> 16:11.100
Have you confirmed it?

16:13.120 --> 16:15.720
Not... directly, no.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.570
Get a load of this.

16:25.130 --> 16:28.400
It's like a who's who 
of White Tiger Guild bigwigs.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.000
There an A-Rank gate 
around here or something?

16:31.740 --> 16:33.470
Hwang Dongsoo...

16:33.470 --> 16:39.310
It's been a while, Baek Yoonho. 
Didn't think I'd run into you.

16:39.710 --> 16:41.280
Why are you here?

16:41.280 --> 16:44.770
You're supposed to be in America. 
What are you doing in our jurisdiction?

16:46.060 --> 16:47.860
Your "jurisdiction"?

16:48.220 --> 16:50.070
I got a question for you, then.

16:50.850 --> 16:56.310
What the hell's some unaffiliated E-Rank trash 
doing inside of a White Tiger Guild gate?

16:56.310 --> 16:57.530
What?

16:57.530 --> 16:59.930
This Sung Jinwoo guy.

16:59.930 --> 17:01.540
<i>Hwang's after him, too?</i>

17:01.540 --> 17:05.310
I bothered coming down here, 
and he's stuck behind a red gate?

17:05.310 --> 17:08.210
I was hoping to at least 
get a look at the bastard.

17:08.210 --> 17:11.950
And now he's probably gonna 
bite it on the other side.

17:12.360 --> 17:15.300
<i>Sung Jinwoo... You're a lucky man.</i>

17:15.970 --> 17:19.770
<i>Even Hwang Dongsoo can't do anything 
to someone on the other side of a red gate.</i>

17:19.770 --> 17:25.350
<i>The question then becomes: are you 
lucky enough to get out of there alive?</i>

17:29.990 --> 17:33.990
The experience payout here is way higher. 
I guess that's a red gate for you.

17:34.460 --> 17:38.120
Wh-Who in the world are you?

17:40.210 --> 17:42.750
Bear meat tastes better than I expected.

17:43.220 --> 17:46.120
We're not getting attacked as much...

17:46.120 --> 17:49.480
Did Hunter Sung kill most 
of the bears already?

17:49.480 --> 17:52.880
There should still be some in their dens. 
We have to be careful.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.630
I can't help but wonder...

17:55.020 --> 17:58.940
After all of that fighting, 
he still wants after-meal exercise?

18:00.680 --> 18:02.610
He's definitely a strange one.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.410
Sure is.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.030
Looks like an even match, numbers-wise.

18:18.210 --> 18:19.450
Get out here.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.840
This'll be your first job.

18:46.350 --> 18:47.410
Go.

19:17.130 --> 19:21.490
<i>Artillery with high firepower. 
Infantry that can regenerate quickly.</i>

19:21.490 --> 19:23.750
<i>They're outperforming my expectations.</i>

19:23.750 --> 19:26.350
<i>Although they do drain a ton of mana...</i>

19:31.520 --> 19:33.190
You must be the leader of the pack.

19:53.790 --> 19:57.840
<i>The shadow soldiers were wiped out instantly. 
I don't have the mana to resummon them.</i>

20:00.340 --> 20:01.560
Igris.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.170
Wow.

21:03.630 --> 21:07.710
<i>If Igris had been fighting 
with his sword the entire time,</i>

21:07.710 --> 21:09.830
<i>he definitely would've killed me.</i>

21:10.830 --> 21:13.170
<i>Only at my current level 
are we on equal footing...</i>

21:13.780 --> 21:17.460
<i>No. I might still be weaker.</i>

21:20.860 --> 21:22.340
Nice work.

21:33.040 --> 21:33.940
Help—

21:36.530 --> 21:38.610
<i>This shouldn't be possible...</i>

21:39.240 --> 21:43.570
<i>I... I'm going to join the elite 
of the White Tiger Guild!</i>

21:44.110 --> 21:47.030
<i>This can't be happening to me!</i>

21:48.480 --> 21:50.250
Captain...!
