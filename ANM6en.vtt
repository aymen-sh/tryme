00:00.770 --> 00:06.240
The Aizu Domain has extended a 
formal offer to enlist the Mibu Roshigumi.

00:06.960 --> 00:10.280
The fourth Aizu man cut down on the street.

00:11.150 --> 00:16.320
He relayed the killer's words 
to us just before he passed:

00:17.080 --> 00:22.540
"Are you Aizu dogs blind? 
The five of us will see heaven's justice done."

00:23.080 --> 00:25.880
How could anyone do 
something so awful? They'll pay.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.330
First, we need information.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.970
You're here about the
 murdered Aizu samurai.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.090
It's a good thing we had our guards up.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.550
We may be kids, but we're not easy prey.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.730
I pity you children.

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:06.250 --> 01:11.960
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:24.910 --> 02:27.390
I've always been a worrywart.

02:27.910 --> 02:31.510
I tend to take the worst view of things.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.480
<i>He's the assassin who's been 
killing the Aizu men.</i>

02:39.020 --> 02:40.040
Hajime-kun!

02:40.420 --> 02:41.470
<i>That's not iai.</i>

02:43.310 --> 02:44.030
Oh?

02:46.550 --> 02:48.880
That makes it all the more tragic.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.810
<i>This is a fight to the death.</i>

03:13.280 --> 03:14.040
Bring it.

03:21.630 --> 03:23.440
H-Hey! Wait!

03:23.440 --> 03:24.950
Let's talk this out!

03:25.480 --> 03:27.060
Move, Nio. You're in my way.

03:27.060 --> 03:28.760
I... I'm not going anywhere!

03:29.160 --> 03:31.140
Look where I'm standing.

03:31.660 --> 03:36.480
You can cut me down, but Hajime-kun's 
next strike will get you if you do.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.730
Please. Just a few words.

03:41.090 --> 03:41.870
Idiot.

03:42.910 --> 03:46.110
So you're not just any children.

03:46.710 --> 03:50.120
One has strength beyond his years.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.870
The other has courage and a brain.

03:54.450 --> 03:56.810
You're being deceived.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.620
Do you know why we must 
eliminate foreigners?

04:00.620 --> 04:02.250
U-Um...

04:02.250 --> 04:05.580
Because they come into 
our country and do bad things?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.600
"Bad things"? Such as what?

04:09.980 --> 04:13.800
Th-They threaten people with guns
 to take money and things.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.540
They bring in awful diseases.

04:16.800 --> 04:21.730
A-And they ride around 
on horses and... and, um...

04:21.730 --> 04:22.840
Opium.

04:23.050 --> 04:24.600
Wh-What's "opium"?

04:25.120 --> 04:26.540
A drug.

04:26.540 --> 04:31.560
An elixir of death. 
One dose rots both body and mind.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.240
An elixir of death?

04:34.970 --> 04:40.120
They start by trading with silver, 
but that's just bait.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.680
They quickly switch to opium.

04:43.140 --> 04:45.730
It leads to nothing but tragedy.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.640
They corrupt countries 
from within, then take over.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.530
It happened to our neighbors, the Qing.

04:52.940 --> 04:56.380
Foreigners—the English—attacked them.

04:57.360 --> 05:03.280
The war ended in defeat for the Qing, 
but the flow of opium hasn't stopped.

05:03.780 --> 05:06.990
Has anyone told you of this?

05:07.420 --> 05:08.610
<i>N-No one.</i>

05:09.210 --> 05:11.020
<i>Do all the Miburo know about this?</i>

05:11.400 --> 05:16.770
Yet the Shogunate still plans to open up
the country, and Aizu supports it.

05:16.770 --> 05:19.530
The Miburo will become their agents.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.800
They're taking advantage of your ignorance.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.300
Thoughtlessness. Failure to 
consider the consequences.

05:26.480 --> 05:30.800
In my opinion, both are crimes.

05:31.410 --> 05:35.860
The Shogunate has no idea. 
Thus, Choshu has risen up.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.190
If you stand in our way, I have no choice...

05:43.570 --> 05:44.570
but to kill you.

05:45.060 --> 05:48.230
<i>H-He's an anti-shogunate idealist.</i>

05:50.850 --> 05:52.940
Is that your idea of justice?

05:53.670 --> 05:54.580
It is.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.540
Do you call ripping out 
your victim's eyes justice, too?

06:00.040 --> 06:02.420
I couldn't make my point otherwise.

06:02.900 --> 06:07.840
In point of fact, it has rattled Aizu. 
That makes it necessary.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.510
Do you get it now? Fall back!

06:11.730 --> 06:12.550
I will not.

06:12.860 --> 06:14.050
Why, you...

06:17.810 --> 06:19.240
So you <i>do</i> get it.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.700
But we won't kill him.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.230
We need him to tell us 
where to find the other four.

06:25.830 --> 06:28.700
<i>I need to fight. For...</i>

06:30.390 --> 06:31.960
<i>For my own idea of justice.</i>

06:36.710 --> 06:38.310
You'll join the fray?

06:39.050 --> 06:40.240
How sad.

06:43.020 --> 06:45.290
<i>He'll watch out for Hajime-kun more than me.</i>

06:45.890 --> 06:46.960
<i>I'll use that to...</i>

06:53.800 --> 06:55.050
<i>Someone's there!</i>

06:55.840 --> 06:57.350
Hajime-kun, behind you!

06:58.830 --> 07:01.520
Aw, damn. I wanted to give you a scare.

07:02.190 --> 07:05.000
<i>Unthinkable. I had no idea he was there.</i>

07:05.000 --> 07:07.280
<i>What? Who is this guy?</i>

07:07.980 --> 07:10.120
What are you doing here, Kyoshiro?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.240
I came to help, brother!

07:12.540 --> 07:14.240
<i>B-Brother?</i>

07:14.560 --> 07:16.050
Wait a moment.

07:16.050 --> 07:18.680
I'm from Choshu. You're from Satsuma.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.860
Our births and upbringings 
were nothing alike.

07:22.330 --> 07:24.160
Since when are we "brothers"?

07:24.160 --> 07:27.820
Huh? We shared cups, didn't we?

07:27.820 --> 07:30.690
We drank together once and
 now you consider us family?

07:31.240 --> 07:32.450
How sad.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.970
I make sure I said to act 
independently to avoid attention.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.580
Situations change, and so do tactics.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.450
I take life as it comes.

07:41.450 --> 07:44.210
Jutaro, you're too set in your ways.

07:45.630 --> 07:46.440
<i>Not good.</i>

07:46.690 --> 07:49.750
<i>We're stuck here with 
two of the five assassins.</i>

07:50.120 --> 07:53.400
He wears swords on both hips.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.400
Are they wakizashi? Or kodachi?

07:56.400 --> 07:58.670
We've just gotta kill 'em all!

07:58.880 --> 08:03.510
Listen up. The trick to this job 
is doing what needs doing.

08:03.670 --> 08:07.280
Without whining, waiting, 
or leaving anything to chance!

08:09.630 --> 08:11.010
<i>Is he a shinobi?</i>

08:13.360 --> 08:14.270
Hajime-kun!

08:14.640 --> 08:15.490
Now...

08:17.620 --> 08:19.220
So you will stand and fight.

08:19.590 --> 08:21.540
<i>What did I pick up a sword for?</i>

08:22.290 --> 08:24.420
<i>For right now. For this moment!</i>

08:27.360 --> 08:28.480
<i>Get closer.</i>

08:30.920 --> 08:31.730
<i>Closer.</i>

08:36.400 --> 08:37.240
<i>He's in range.</i>

08:42.630 --> 08:44.000
How futile.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.590
Won't you join us?

08:59.200 --> 09:00.020
I will not.

09:05.390 --> 09:09.050
You're young and clever. 
You simply don't know anything.

09:09.490 --> 09:11.390
To be honest, I'd rather not kill you.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.800
Swear that you won't side 
with the Shogunate.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.900
That you'll have no more to do with Aizu.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.780
Tell me you'll leave 
the Miburo this instant.

09:22.780 --> 09:23.870
No!

09:30.090 --> 09:31.190
Last chance.

09:31.740 --> 09:33.960
Don't throw your life away.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.720
I am a Miburo!

09:42.480 --> 09:45.840
<i>I'll never say it! Never!</i>

09:46.590 --> 09:49.360
<i>I may die, but I'll never sell my soul!</i>

09:51.440 --> 09:52.980
Where's the soul?

09:52.980 --> 09:54.480
I can!

09:54.950 --> 09:57.900
<i>I have one, and I'm gonna keep it!</i>

09:59.000 --> 10:01.640
If you stand in our way, I have no choice...

10:03.390 --> 10:04.250
but to kill you.

10:04.660 --> 10:08.440
If nothing and no one can 
take them from you...

10:09.880 --> 10:11.920
that's your idea of justice.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.430
<i>I understand.</i>

10:14.880 --> 10:18.420
We share one purpose: to defend Kyoto!

10:18.810 --> 10:22.610
<i>Now I'm sure. It's not about 
our ideas of justice.</i>

10:23.440 --> 10:27.520
<i>Whatever happens, 
I can't let this guy run loose!</i>

10:28.130 --> 10:35.800
For the nation and for the future, 
I must sometimes sacrifice innocent souls.

10:35.990 --> 10:37.200
<i>Sacrifice?</i>

10:37.800 --> 10:43.740
<i>What gives a murderer the right 
to talk about our country's future?!</i>

10:45.070 --> 10:45.980
<i>Damn it.</i>

10:46.410 --> 10:48.190
<i>Damn it!</i>

10:55.360 --> 10:56.340
Nio!

10:56.340 --> 10:58.240
Nio! Say something!

10:59.920 --> 11:01.230
How sad.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.190
O-Okita!

11:29.640 --> 11:30.530
Hey.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.540
Nio-kun. Nio-kun.

11:34.920 --> 11:38.550
Hang in there. Can you do that?

11:38.800 --> 11:40.480
Huh? Who's he?

11:40.780 --> 11:43.010
<i>For a shinobi, he sure leaves himself open.</i>

11:47.550 --> 11:48.230
Nio!

11:48.470 --> 11:50.850
Nio! Get up! Nio!

11:53.960 --> 11:55.640
You're gonna regret this.

11:55.950 --> 11:57.650
You're dead, asshole!

11:59.160 --> 12:01.490
I'll take you down, even if it kills me.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.920
I'll smash your bones to dust 
and stomp you into hell!

12:06.400 --> 12:07.500
Hey...

12:13.970 --> 12:15.520
You're alive?

12:15.520 --> 12:17.440
Huh? Taro-kun?

12:17.440 --> 12:20.130
Bah! You couldn't just stay dead, could you?

12:20.440 --> 12:21.550
I'm so glad.

12:21.990 --> 12:23.290
And Okita-san, too?

12:23.710 --> 12:24.860
You must be a Miburo.

12:26.290 --> 12:28.090
You're in the wrong here.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.960
Grown men tempt and 
incite with honeyed lies,

12:32.480 --> 12:35.170
drawing children into bloody war.

12:36.030 --> 12:38.140
You have much to answer for.

12:39.590 --> 12:42.550
Someone always says something like that.

12:42.550 --> 12:43.530
What?

12:43.820 --> 12:49.350
"Children can't think things through. 
They need adults to guide them."

12:49.920 --> 12:51.540
But I wonder.

12:52.110 --> 12:57.750
These boys have lives of their own. 
They have their own worries and conflicts.

12:58.440 --> 13:02.050
Child society is more complex
than adults imagine.

13:03.130 --> 13:06.680
So they lie and scheme 
without a second thought.

13:07.650 --> 13:09.520
They have dreams.

13:09.800 --> 13:10.800
They have pride.

13:11.430 --> 13:12.690
They have their world.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.080
You shouldn't look down on them.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.640
They can think and act for themselves.

13:20.120 --> 13:23.630
Conceited adults only tell themselves 
they can bend kids to their will.

13:26.340 --> 13:28.800
You Shogunate dog.

13:29.750 --> 13:30.480
A dog?

13:31.930 --> 13:33.600
Is that supposed to be an insult?

13:34.090 --> 13:36.120
What a silly thing to say.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.020
Everyone is some kind of dog.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.720
Some people just don't realize it.

13:43.770 --> 13:47.630
I haven't met anyone so impossible 
to talk to since Kyoshiro.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.850
Are you even listening to me?

13:50.530 --> 13:53.520
I'm listening. I'm answering you, aren't I?

13:53.770 --> 13:57.920
I'll bet you've been called 
a poor speaker all your life.

13:57.920 --> 14:03.280
Not at all. Woman and children 
tell me I'm easy to talk to.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.090
That's not what I mean!

14:05.090 --> 14:09.700
Oh, but people do ask me to explain
 swordsmanship more clearly.

14:10.010 --> 14:10.820
That's it!

14:12.560 --> 14:15.020
The Shogunate is doomed.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.520
Why don't you see that?

14:16.520 --> 14:19.000
What? Really?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.790
Stand your ground! Tell me your ideas.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.120
I won't debate you.

14:24.690 --> 14:26.550
That's not my job.

14:26.550 --> 14:28.560
Wh-What?

14:30.140 --> 14:31.440
Anyway...

14:32.760 --> 14:35.670
If you're a swordsman, 
we should talk with these.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.080
You witless oaf.

14:41.440 --> 14:45.570
Oh, come on. You think you 
can beat Jutaro man-to-man?

14:50.780 --> 14:52.410
He hasn't left any openings.

14:53.010 --> 14:54.970
<i>Unlike you.</i>

14:56.060 --> 14:58.370
You might as well tell me your name.

14:58.370 --> 15:01.660
Oh, I like that. Like a proper duel.

15:02.350 --> 15:06.090
I am Kimura Jutaro, samurai of Choshu.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.220
I'll remember that.

15:08.420 --> 15:10.300
I'm Okita Soji.

15:11.220 --> 15:12.300
Okita-san.

15:12.780 --> 15:14.310
I feel so sad.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.310
You're going to die.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.180
The fight's started, right?

15:26.860 --> 15:28.990
This sword is for me?

15:29.440 --> 15:32.330
A masterwork. It has been 
in our family for generations.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.860
I can't accept such a treasure.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.120
Don't worry.

15:39.070 --> 15:45.170
Jutaro, work for others and the 
greater good, not for your own gain.

15:45.870 --> 15:47.610
My sincerest gratitude.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.820
I swear to serve society.

15:58.260 --> 15:59.100
<i>This cannot be.</i>

15:59.890 --> 16:05.330
<i>I haven't done nearly enough... 
for the greater...</i>

16:09.890 --> 16:10.320
Oh!

16:11.600 --> 16:13.040
I forgot.

16:14.130 --> 16:15.570
I'm a Miburo!

16:15.960 --> 16:18.320
Okita Soji of the Mibu Roshigumi!

16:19.110 --> 16:21.290
<i>H-He's so strong.</i>

16:22.200 --> 16:24.550
<i>He never feels doubt or hesitates.</i>

16:25.500 --> 16:28.440
<i>This is what it means to fight 
with your life on the line.</i>

16:29.130 --> 16:31.430
<i>This is what Okita-san can really do.</i>

16:31.670 --> 16:33.170
You sack of shit!

16:33.170 --> 16:35.220
You killed Jutaro!

16:35.220 --> 16:37.140
I'll make you regret that!

16:37.140 --> 16:39.940
You're dead, Miburo dog!

16:41.680 --> 16:42.850
A shuriken?

16:42.850 --> 16:44.180
He's a ninja!

16:44.400 --> 16:47.360
A ninja? That sounds so fun!

16:50.610 --> 16:51.560
I'll go after him!

16:51.560 --> 16:52.430
Wait!

16:52.840 --> 16:54.190
I-I'll go with you.

16:54.190 --> 16:55.310
Give it a rest!

16:58.730 --> 16:59.440
Huh?

17:00.750 --> 17:02.080
H-Hey!

17:02.830 --> 17:04.920
Hang in there, you big idiot!

17:14.370 --> 17:18.090
Is this... the Yagi house?

17:21.470 --> 17:23.360
Someone must have carried me back.

17:33.860 --> 17:34.910
Hijikata-san.

17:35.650 --> 17:36.990
I, um...

17:38.100 --> 17:39.740
Taro saved you.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.750
He showed Soji the way.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.210
Taro-kun did?

17:44.740 --> 17:47.080
Sanosuke carried you back, though.

17:47.940 --> 17:49.610
He wants dango later.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.910
I see.

17:53.230 --> 17:54.440
I'll have to thank him.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.380
So, um, what about everyone else?

17:58.200 --> 18:01.520
They say they won't come back until 
they've killed the four other brutes.

18:02.140 --> 18:04.990
Without sleeping? That's dedication.

18:09.800 --> 18:10.600
Hijikata-san.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.120
What is it?

18:12.930 --> 18:17.270
Could I please have a real sword?

18:19.280 --> 18:20.450
Why do you want one?

18:21.000 --> 18:24.520
You'd better not be thinking of revenge 
for your brush with death.

18:25.140 --> 18:27.280
N-No, nothing like that.

18:27.700 --> 18:31.820
A sword is a weapon for killing. 
Do you understand that?

18:32.400 --> 18:35.790
Yes, sir. I've seen that more 
than once since I came here.

18:36.270 --> 18:39.550
What would you do with one? 
Could you draw it?

18:40.920 --> 18:43.560
I... don't think I could.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.060
B-But, um...

18:48.570 --> 18:49.930
Hajime told me.

18:50.670 --> 18:54.560
It wasn't just some 
crazed killer this time, was it?

18:55.600 --> 18:56.160
Right.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.600
He needed to pay for what he'd done,

19:00.040 --> 19:03.840
but what he said made sense. 
It didn't sound wrong.

19:05.450 --> 19:07.290
Were the Aizu people angry?

19:07.750 --> 19:09.480
Their fellows were murdered.

19:10.370 --> 19:14.090
I suppose. They seemed angry and sad.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.500
So did Kyoshiro-san.

19:17.550 --> 19:18.450
Who?

19:19.640 --> 19:22.000
The man Okita-san killed was Jutaro-san.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.260
Kyoshiro-san was the other one.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.520
He sounded furious about losing a comrade.

19:28.970 --> 19:31.650
I hear he turned tail and ran all the same.

19:32.010 --> 19:35.010
He must be quick on his feet 
if he managed to lose Soji.

19:35.350 --> 19:40.620
I think he weighed his anger against 
his chances of dying, and chose survival.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.980
He must have been calm 
and smart enough for that.

19:45.030 --> 19:46.750
Losing a comrade made him angry.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.140
I understand that feeling.

19:49.790 --> 19:52.660
They really are just like us.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.200
<i>As observant as ever.</i>

19:56.010 --> 19:59.960
<i>His insight makes it easy to 
over-empathize with his opponents.</i>

20:01.670 --> 20:02.970
Here's your sword.

20:03.150 --> 20:03.720
Huh?

20:05.220 --> 20:09.550
I was already planning to give it to you. 
I woke up a shopkeeper to get it.

20:10.170 --> 20:13.230
It's cheap, but it's sharp.

20:15.590 --> 20:19.880
You won't run from a fight just because 
you understand the other side, will you?

20:22.350 --> 20:22.900
Right.

20:23.720 --> 20:24.290
Take it.

20:24.710 --> 20:25.340
Yes, sir.

20:27.870 --> 20:29.780
I-It's certainly heavy.

20:30.120 --> 20:34.380
We all carry something 
that makes the weight worth it.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.490
You shoulder something important, too.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.220
Don't forget that.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.130
Never stop feeling that weight.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.800
Nio, what is your burden?

20:49.600 --> 20:53.260
I want to make a world where
townspeople feel safe to go out at night.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.310
Good.

20:54.650 --> 20:57.200
I want to make a world 
where kids feel safe to cry.

20:57.480 --> 20:58.520
Good.

20:58.980 --> 21:02.280
I want to make a world 
where the weak aren't abused.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.360
Good.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.090
I really do need to stop those people!

21:08.790 --> 21:12.530
Killing people to change 
the world <i>has</i> to be wrong.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.880
Thank you for this sword, sir.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.990
I promise I'll use it with care.

21:16.990 --> 21:19.520
You're taking both? They'll get in the way.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.370
I'll use this one.

21:22.780 --> 21:25.340
This is my soul! I won't use it!

21:25.800 --> 21:27.160
What sense does that make?

21:28.770 --> 21:29.850
Well, all right.

21:31.810 --> 21:32.650
Let's go.

21:32.650 --> 21:34.320
Huh? Where to, sir?

21:34.670 --> 21:36.110
Isn't that obvious?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.940
To see that boy who set you up.

21:44.950 --> 21:49.950
<b>To
Each</b>

21:44.950 --> 21:49.950
<b>His Own
Justice</b>

23:20.040 --> 23:25.460
<b>Next time</b>

23:21.790 --> 23:23.610
T-Tanaka Taro here.

23:24.160 --> 23:30.160
I'm glad Nio's all right, but now 
I'm stuck tagging along with patrols.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.650
How am I supposed to track down shady guys?

23:34.200 --> 23:39.350
Wait. Come to think of it, 
I do know one guy I don't trust.

23:39.580 --> 23:42.400
I swear I'll dig up dirt on him.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.640
Next time: "Pride."

23:45.120 --> 23:48.440
Y-You <i>will</i> watch it, right?

23:47.110 --> 23:49.950
<b>Pride</b>
