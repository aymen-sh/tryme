00:00.740 --> 00:04.100
<b>Two Weeks Before the <i>Perseus</i>'s Departure</b>

00:02.710 --> 00:04.100
What's up with this, Senku?

00:04.100 --> 00:06.380
This wheat's all soggy.

00:06.380 --> 00:08.140
And it's sprouted.

00:08.140 --> 00:09.820
And that's totally fine.

00:09.820 --> 00:12.320
And then we dry it over a fire.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.360
Even though you just soaked it?

00:14.360 --> 00:15.990
What are you even trying to do?

00:15.990 --> 00:18.410
Knead it well and get rid of the hulls.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.120
And then beat the heck out of it!

00:21.120 --> 00:23.960
And then mix it in hot water and filter.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.720
All done. Wheat juice.

00:28.090 --> 00:32.600
Toss in some of Japan's own hops, 
<i>Humulus lupulus</i>, and boil.

00:32.910 --> 00:36.090
And then we just let the 
mighty yeast do their thing.

00:36.460 --> 00:39.580
It'll ferment on its own and become alcohol.

00:39.580 --> 00:42.600
The yeast will even carbonate it for us.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.310
Beer is rather impressive, is it not?

00:52.310 --> 00:57.950
They even paid pyramid builders 
with beer back in ancient Egypt.

00:58.210 --> 01:00.580
It's perfect after heavy labor.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.010
You're right.

01:04.450 --> 01:05.850
It's fantastic!

01:06.500 --> 01:08.880
Aren't you having any, Senku?

01:08.880 --> 01:10.370
I'll pass.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.950
Nah, I'm not the only one.

01:12.950 --> 01:16.880
The ship will sink if everyone 
gets drunk at the same time.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.680
There's always gonna be 
a few who avoid drinking.

01:22.330 --> 01:24.950
I can't drink alcohol.

01:24.950 --> 01:27.020
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:28.310 --> 01:29.890
All right, then.

01:30.240 --> 01:35.110
But so long as you're on my ship, when it's 
time to have fun, you're going to have fun.

01:35.110 --> 01:37.030
I won't allow a single exception!

01:37.280 --> 01:38.330
Francois!

01:39.490 --> 01:40.420
Understood.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.740
I shall mix a special soft drink cocktail

01:43.740 --> 01:48.710
for each of those who will not be imbibing.

01:48.710 --> 01:51.970
Isn't that a bit extreme? 
It's just a shipboard minibar!

01:51.970 --> 01:53.970
You can count on Francois 
to take it to the extreme.

01:55.270 --> 01:57.060
Let me know if you need anything.

01:57.060 --> 02:00.220
Yeah, the science team will take care of it!

02:00.480 --> 02:02.710
Thank you kindly.

02:03.660 --> 02:05.980
In that case, since you offered...

03:43.170 --> 03:44.620
Gum syrup?

03:44.860 --> 03:46.620
We're making it out of wheat.

03:46.620 --> 03:51.710
The stuff you get in the water when 
you wash wheat flour is starch.

03:52.210 --> 03:55.150
We'll add a dash of sulfuric 
acid as a secret ingredient.

03:55.150 --> 03:57.420
It's our friend Ryu-san again.

03:57.420 --> 03:59.340
Sulfuric acid?! In a drink?!

03:59.340 --> 04:01.720
How are you even supposed to drink that?!

04:02.350 --> 04:04.860
It'll melt your teeth if you drink it straight.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.950
That's why we're boiling it good.

04:06.950 --> 04:12.730
I knew it. We're going to use 
chemistry to detoxify it, right?

04:12.730 --> 04:14.900
You gotta slow down, Gen.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.810
And then we add barium carbonate.

04:16.810 --> 04:18.770
Even more poison?!

04:18.770 --> 04:21.380
I mean, it's just the name that 
makes it sound bad, right?

04:21.380 --> 04:24.770
Think about it. There's no way 
we'd be using legit poison.

04:24.770 --> 04:26.570
No, it's legit poison.

04:26.570 --> 04:27.920
Why?!

04:27.920 --> 04:30.260
Just shut up already.

04:30.260 --> 04:33.940
We've been making sugar and stuff with this.

04:33.940 --> 04:38.030
Mix it well, check the pH, 
and filter it, and it's harmless.

04:38.030 --> 04:39.760
That's how science works.

04:39.760 --> 04:42.150
Don't try this if you don't know 
what you're doing. You'll die.

04:42.870 --> 04:45.470
And now we have gum syrup.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.790
Sweet!

04:55.920 --> 04:57.950
Are you warming milk?

04:57.950 --> 05:01.150
It's not much hotter than bath water. 
Is that hot enough?

05:01.150 --> 05:03.190
That's the trick.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.360
It turned into yogurt stuff!

05:07.650 --> 05:11.620
Filtered yogurt, gum syrup, 
and lemon together make...

05:13.120 --> 05:15.830
m 0 0 l 226 0 l 226 80 l 0 80

05:13.120 --> 05:15.830
Lactic drink
acquired!!

05:32.920 --> 05:34.520
Please enjoy.

05:43.250 --> 05:46.260
I-I've never had anything like this!

05:46.260 --> 05:48.430
It's super sweet and just a little bit sour.

05:48.430 --> 05:49.980
It's so good!

05:49.980 --> 05:53.040
I tried adding apple juice to a lactic drink.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.090
Apple flavor. Good idea.

05:56.930 --> 05:59.230
It even has a cucumber garnish.

05:59.230 --> 06:02.920
It's so cute with the Suika mask.

06:03.270 --> 06:05.490
It's not just a garnish.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.720
Try dropping it into the glass once 
you've finished about half of it.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.560
It changed into watermelon flavor!

06:18.560 --> 06:21.480
It's really refreshing!

06:21.480 --> 06:22.710
That's so strange.

06:22.710 --> 06:24.630
How did apple turn into watermelon?

06:24.630 --> 06:28.490
Ah, so that's what happens when you mix 
gourd family plants with fruit juice.

06:29.260 --> 06:31.920
Your pure smile, like the sunshine,

06:31.920 --> 06:35.950
reacts with your mask 
and offers a different charm.

06:35.950 --> 06:41.170
<b>Lactic drink... 45ml</b>

06:35.950 --> 06:41.170
<b>Apple juice... 30ml</b>

06:35.950 --> 06:41.170
<b>Cucumber (grated)
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h... a bit</b>

06:35.950 --> 06:41.170
<b>Cucumber ... a bit</b>

06:36.690 --> 06:40.600
A cocktail for Suika-sama, the 2Side Sunshine.

06:42.380 --> 06:47.380
I've seen bartenders in movies 
throw drinks like that.

06:48.010 --> 06:51.830
There must be some scientific reason 
for how you mix drinks, right?

06:51.830 --> 06:52.760
You think so?

06:53.050 --> 06:54.700
None whatsoever.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.890
There isn't?!

06:55.890 --> 06:57.650
It's called flair.

06:57.650 --> 07:02.080
It serves the vital purpose of treating the 
guest's eyes in addition to their palates.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.060
Francois is a real master
of the art of hospitality.

07:06.540 --> 07:08.860
A cocktail for Tsukasa-sama.

07:08.860 --> 07:11.950
<b>Grenadine (pomegranate)
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSyrup... 20ml</b>

07:09.680 --> 07:14.030
The red of the pomegranate under 
the light of science, the black light,

07:14.260 --> 07:17.790
changes like the gentle flame 
inside Tsukasa-sama's heart.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.580
It changed blue!

07:19.580 --> 07:20.830
It's glowing...

07:20.830 --> 07:22.170
So pretty.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.600
Not bad.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.050
It's delicious.

07:29.050 --> 07:34.050
For Gen-sama, a grown-up kick 
under a simple exterior.

07:34.050 --> 07:36.720
<b>Cola... 120ml</b>

07:34.050 --> 07:36.720
<b>Chai syrup</b>

07:34.050 --> 07:36.720
<b>...1-2 teaspoons</b>

07:34.050 --> 07:36.720
<b>Lemon... 1 slice</b>

07:34.050 --> 07:36.720
<b>Chili pepper... a pinch</b>

07:39.740 --> 07:42.020
Spicy grown-up cola!

07:42.020 --> 07:43.940
For you, Kohaku-sama.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.190
<b>Spicy Cinderella</b>

07:44.440 --> 07:47.190
<b>Ginger ale... 60ml</b>

07:44.440 --> 07:47.190
<b>Orange juice... 20ml</b>

07:44.440 --> 07:47.190
<b>Pineapple juice... 30ml</b>

07:44.440 --> 07:47.190
<b>Lemon juice... 5ml</b>

07:44.440 --> 07:47.190
<b>Grated ginger... 1 scoop</b>

07:48.230 --> 07:50.060
Humanity is a force to be reckoned with.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.950
All the drinks that can be made 
with just natural ingredients...

07:56.460 --> 07:59.450
Although, everything in this world is natural.

07:59.450 --> 08:03.710
And this cocktail is for Senku-sama.

08:03.710 --> 08:08.670
<b>Three-layer Tea Latte</b>

08:03.710 --> 08:08.670
<b>Whipped matcha... 30ml</b>

08:03.710 --> 08:08.670
<b>Milk... 50ml</b>

08:03.710 --> 08:08.670
<b>Hojicha tea... 20ml</b>

08:03.710 --> 08:08.670
<b>Gum syrup... 2 teaspoons</b>

08:04.220 --> 08:08.670
From the top, whipped matcha, 
milk, and hojicha syrup.

08:09.020 --> 08:13.300
The layering represents the 
way science builds on itself.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.730
I don't care, as long as it's a drink.

08:15.730 --> 08:17.290
You mind if I stir this now?

08:17.290 --> 08:19.260
I thought you might ask that.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.730
With your elegant mixing,

08:23.030 --> 08:28.370
the many efforts of science 
will mix into a mildly sweet latte.

08:36.430 --> 08:39.080
Come on, drink with us, Matsukaze.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.050
Tell 'em all those stories about your past.

08:42.050 --> 08:43.510
Your master, was it?

08:43.510 --> 08:46.000
Tell him how awesome I used to be.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.790
That wasn't you, Ginro.

08:49.980 --> 08:54.050
My master had a strong 
spirit until the very end.

08:57.010 --> 09:00.100
There was no warning.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.970
When it rained down...

09:02.970 --> 09:09.680
Perhaps it had someone's voice, 
or perhaps it finally heard our curses...

09:10.240 --> 09:14.900
It didn't take long for us to understand 
how the wicked weapon works.

09:18.580 --> 09:22.160
Should these land in the hands of bandits, 
the island will fall prey to crime!

09:22.160 --> 09:24.410
Find them all and destroy them!

09:28.330 --> 09:29.290
Master!

09:35.370 --> 09:36.470
Matsukaze...

09:37.090 --> 09:38.890
There's no saving me now.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.480
Master...

09:40.800 --> 09:42.280
Enough of that nonsense.

09:42.980 --> 09:45.630
I've been thinking...

09:46.810 --> 09:50.580
Why did the heavens spread the 
petrification weapon among the people?

09:51.970 --> 09:54.100
At first, I thought it was divine punishment.

09:54.650 --> 09:56.090
But it's strange...

09:56.700 --> 10:03.250
If the goal was to petrify everyone, 
it would have only taken one device.

10:03.950 --> 10:09.630
And why are they made to be 
so easy for us humans to use?

10:10.510 --> 10:14.910
It's almost as though they intended for us 
to use the devices against each other.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.800
That's what upsets me the most.

10:19.340 --> 10:22.780
I want the heavens to suffer for it, Matsukaze.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.640
I want them to see that we 
humans aren't that foolish.

10:27.220 --> 10:29.660
That they're underestimating us.

10:57.170 --> 10:58.810
My fate is inescapable.

10:59.560 --> 11:04.930
I must make sure future generations 
know of the source of this evil.

11:15.900 --> 11:21.710
I'm aware that the sin of failing 
to protect my master is not one

11:21.710 --> 11:24.570
that can be erased by defeating Why Man.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.990
Still, I...

11:29.830 --> 11:32.580
<b>Matcha Beer</b>

11:29.830 --> 11:32.580
<b>Beer... 200ml</b>

11:29.830 --> 11:32.580
<b>Matcha... 1 teaspoon</b>

11:30.810 --> 11:32.580
Beer with matcha.

11:32.870 --> 11:38.170
The bitterness of adulthood will, with time, 
elevate itself into a mellow flavor.

11:38.170 --> 11:39.380
Please enjoy.

11:47.190 --> 11:49.140
He's a lightweight!

12:03.780 --> 12:05.420
I...

12:05.420 --> 12:07.700
I must become stronger.

12:07.700 --> 12:08.630
Yes.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.330
Tsukasa-dono, I'd like to borrow your chest!

12:12.330 --> 12:13.370
Sure.

12:13.370 --> 12:14.590
Tsukasa-dono...

12:15.010 --> 12:16.840
Tsukasa-dono!

12:16.840 --> 12:20.040
Forgive me! I was intoxicated 
and stepped out of line.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.090
Actually...

12:21.610 --> 12:24.450
I was thinking you need some training, as well.

12:25.770 --> 12:28.860
Are we really waking him up, too?

12:30.030 --> 12:32.970
We have a gun with us now.
Besides, Tsukasa's here.

12:32.970 --> 12:34.770
We can keep him under control.

12:35.030 --> 12:41.070
He's not stupid enough to get any weird ideas 
when the whole of humanity is on the line.

12:41.070 --> 12:43.350
You're the battle specialist.

12:43.350 --> 12:46.420
If you think you need him, 
it's your decision, Tsukasa.

12:46.840 --> 12:52.540
Fighting is my job, and he's the most 
qualified for training in that department.

13:02.170 --> 13:04.670
We need your help, Hyoga.

13:04.670 --> 13:10.430
With training in modern martial arts, 
Matsukaze will improve dramatically.

13:12.980 --> 13:15.740
I have just one condition.

13:16.810 --> 13:17.960
What's that?

13:17.960 --> 13:22.040
Do you want to be pardoned for 
offing Tsukasa and the rest?

13:21.050 --> 13:23.530
I don't need that.

13:23.880 --> 13:28.660
I would never be granted such a thing after 
the judicial institutions are revived.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.720
My condition is two revivals.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.540
Give me the right to revive two people.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.760
Hyoga-sama.

13:53.370 --> 13:54.680
What was it...

13:54.680 --> 13:56.980
Owari Kanryu-style spear techniques?

13:57.240 --> 14:01.920
Maybe I'll give this "practice" thing 
a try for the first time in my life.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.900
No, there's something else to do first.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.740
You're right, there is.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.950
There are some cute girls here.

14:11.260 --> 14:13.860
We need to get closer to them first.

14:13.860 --> 14:16.710
Moz-kun, I expect you to be proper.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.440
Kinro! Kinro!

14:28.770 --> 14:31.730
Man, I hate that stuff.

14:31.730 --> 14:34.560
How are you supposed to even go 
near them? It's so dangerous.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.810
So, er...

14:45.440 --> 14:46.950
Did you know, Kinro?

14:46.950 --> 14:52.760
Bitter defeats eventually become 
a mellow something-or-other.

14:52.760 --> 14:53.830
What are you talking about?

14:53.830 --> 14:56.820
Francois said something like that.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.010
I see.

15:00.350 --> 15:01.390
Kinro, what's that?

15:01.390 --> 15:01.870
I know not!

15:01.870 --> 15:03.550
Ow!

15:04.960 --> 15:07.630
<b>Ryusui Theater</b>

15:07.260 --> 15:08.770
The Early Middle Ages.

15:08.770 --> 15:14.300
The northern seas were ruled by us, the Vikings!

15:14.620 --> 15:17.590
With their impressive sailing skills,

15:17.590 --> 15:22.200
they arrived in the Americas 
500 years before Columbus.

15:19.060 --> 15:22.850
<b>The Americas</b>

15:22.850 --> 15:24.770
Amazing, isn't it?

15:24.770 --> 15:26.440
How did they manage it so long ago?

15:26.440 --> 15:28.990
No fair!

15:28.990 --> 15:31.360
Why can they get around so easily?!

15:31.360 --> 15:33.730
It's not as though there are signs on the seas!

15:33.730 --> 15:35.950
The sun is the only sign on the seas.

15:35.950 --> 15:38.870
But the skies aren't always clear.

15:38.870 --> 15:41.080
The Vikings sure are strange.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.210
That's why there's a legend that came about:

15:44.670 --> 15:49.010
that the Vikings must have had a stone 
that would reveal the position of the sun

15:49.010 --> 15:52.050
under any condition—a sunstone.

15:52.380 --> 15:53.340
In any case,

15:53.340 --> 15:58.260
it was exceedingly hard to determine 
your heading and position on the high seas.

15:58.260 --> 16:04.020
So it's exceedingly hard, and we're supposedly 
taking the hardest route there, aren't we?

16:05.590 --> 16:07.290
It's easy now.

16:07.290 --> 16:12.240
Thanks to the great marvel of science 
called GPS, we know exactly where we are.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.000
About that...

16:14.000 --> 16:18.120
How are we using GPS in this stone world?

16:19.410 --> 16:22.640
We coordinate with Ruri and 
the others who stayed in Japan.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.350
What is this?

16:25.350 --> 16:27.590
Look at all these hourglasses!

16:27.960 --> 16:32.390
We use sundials and hourglasses 
to transmit the time in Japan

16:32.390 --> 16:35.800
as accurately as possible to the ship.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.310
Transmit?!

16:37.310 --> 16:38.600
It's really happening!

16:38.600 --> 16:41.350
Chrome's true feelings from far beyond the sea!

16:41.350 --> 16:43.790
What are you even talking about?

16:43.790 --> 16:45.700
We're stupidly far away.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.730
How are we supposed to talk to them?

16:48.080 --> 16:49.840
Then how do we...

16:49.840 --> 16:53.690
We can't talk, but we can just 
barely receive shortwave signals.

16:53.690 --> 16:56.490
So we have them send us time signals every hour.

16:57.960 --> 16:58.890
Like that.

16:59.370 --> 17:02.120
It's 10:00 AM over there.

17:02.750 --> 17:08.210
As long as we know what hour it is, 
I can count the seconds just fine.

17:08.210 --> 17:12.670
Oh, yeah. I forgot you're a 
human stopwatch, Senku-chan.

17:12.970 --> 17:19.280
I don't know how we can tell where 
we are from what time it is, though.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.520
Don't worry.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.980
The modern grown-ups don't quite get it, either.

17:24.620 --> 17:27.710
The sun's at its highest point right now.

17:27.710 --> 17:30.320
The ship's right at 12:00.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.320
From the time difference to Tokyo, 
we get our horizontal position.

17:35.050 --> 17:37.180
From the height of the sun, 
we get our vertical position.

17:37.180 --> 17:40.270
In other words, the <i>Perseus</i> is currently...

17:40.270 --> 17:41.490
here!

17:43.460 --> 17:46.550
I don't get how it works, 
but I got the last part.

17:46.550 --> 17:49.960
We can definitely know where we are if we 
know our horizontal and vertical position!

17:49.960 --> 17:52.430
Traveling with science is awesome.

17:52.430 --> 17:55.720
We know everything as long 
as we can see the sun!

17:55.720 --> 17:56.880
Yup.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.820
As long as we have clear skies,

17:58.820 --> 18:01.640
it's smooth sailing all the way to the States.

18:08.460 --> 18:11.640
Just as soon as you say that. Yeesh...

18:11.640 --> 18:14.630
I mean... Senku-chan's the guy who put

18:14.630 --> 18:17.520
100 skill points in Intelligence, 
Grit, and Willpower

18:17.520 --> 18:20.370
and zero in Luck when he was born.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.250
There's no way we can see 
the sun through all this.

18:27.930 --> 18:31.630
Which means we'll just have to rely on 
my sailor's instincts during the day.

18:31.630 --> 18:34.800
We'll lose a lot of time if this keeps 
up for more than a few days.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.760
We're going to be lost at sea without the sun.

18:38.760 --> 18:43.970
If only we had the sunstone from 
the story about the Vikings...

18:48.930 --> 18:50.190
That's it!

18:50.460 --> 18:54.970
The new rock we got from the skarn deposit, 
nature's treasure chest.

18:54.970 --> 18:58.610
Kohaku, could you use your gorilla 
power to chisel it out cleanly?

18:59.360 --> 19:02.650
Is there a pretty gem in there or something?

19:02.650 --> 19:05.670
I'm more than happy to help 
if we're sending it to Ruri-nee.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.670
I guess... it's pretty, but...

19:10.670 --> 19:12.960
It's just a whitish rock.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.590
That's what I thought at first, too.

19:15.590 --> 19:18.670
But see, when you look at things through it...

19:19.570 --> 19:21.180
It looks a bit off.

19:21.830 --> 19:23.850
You can see it twice!

19:24.820 --> 19:27.220
That is a fascinating rock...

19:27.220 --> 19:30.010
But I don't know if Ruri-nee 
would appreciate it.

19:30.010 --> 19:33.020
Why are we even talking about that?

19:33.790 --> 19:38.720
Anything cool has a chance of turning 
out to be something awesome someday.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.820
So I check everything.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.030
That's the way of the science user!

19:46.900 --> 19:48.120
Look. See?

19:48.120 --> 19:51.920
You can see the mark twice through the rock.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.360
Is this the sun here?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.790
You can't see it at all through the clouds.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.300
Yeah, that's fine.

19:59.300 --> 20:03.090
When you point it at the sun 
at just the right angle...

20:03.860 --> 20:05.240
Look, it lined up!

20:05.240 --> 20:08.180
The two marks show up the exact same tone.

20:08.660 --> 20:10.920
Not that I know why.

20:11.560 --> 20:12.520
Which means...

20:13.040 --> 20:14.120
That's right.

20:14.120 --> 20:18.360
You can see the sun over 
there through the clouds!

20:18.360 --> 20:20.900
m 0 0 l 210 0 l 210 80 l 0 80

20:18.360 --> 20:20.900
"Sunstone"
acquired!!

20:21.210 --> 20:22.990
Calcite!

20:23.350 --> 20:25.570
Calcite is a natural prism.

20:25.570 --> 20:28.200
It splits light into two.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.420
So when these line up, that's where the sun is?

20:32.420 --> 20:34.870
Yeah, that's more or less the idea.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.540
I've heard about something like that.

20:38.430 --> 20:41.680
When they investigate Viking 
shipwrecks at the bottom of the sea,

20:41.680 --> 20:44.840
they come across a surprising amount of calcite.

20:45.290 --> 20:50.480
It's always been a mystery why the 
Vikings were carrying it around.

20:51.170 --> 20:56.320
Maybe it was neither magic 
nor a legend, but a real thing.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.690
The sunstone.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.340
Correct!

21:00.340 --> 21:02.790
And four thousand years later,

21:03.370 --> 21:08.310
we sail to the Americas, 
just like the Vikings did!

21:08.310 --> 21:10.880
Once again, with the immutable power of science!

21:14.800 --> 21:16.960
What are we making with science next?

22:01.360 --> 22:02.500
Land!

22:06.470 --> 22:08.470
F-Finally!

22:08.470 --> 22:10.500
We made it!

22:10.500 --> 22:14.580
We've arrived at the Americas!

23:51.990 --> 23:54.950
