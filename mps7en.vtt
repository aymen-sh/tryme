The three suspects in 1987.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.378
The fact that I was
trying to find the answer

incompetent police came up with...

I told you I could handle it.

00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:21.228
Well...

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.938
Other than these two, it's not
like there's anything really new.

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:31.498
Even though I found out only five
minutes ago. Yes, it was a surprise, but...

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.988
How did you even obtain a photo like
this? It's my first time seeing this, too.

00:01:42.578 --> 00:01:45.068
You must've been very
thorough with your investigation.

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:48.418
Wow! There's no joking around
with your journalism experience.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.878
But there is nothing...

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.948
on Baek Yoo Seop.

00:01:56.948 --> 00:02:00.238
Out of all these documents, I
don't have a single one on him.

00:02:00.238 --> 00:02:03.988
I never considered him as a suspect.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.138
What kind of person was he? Your
dad's older brother, Baek Yoo Seop?

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.708
Well...

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.648
I thought I knew him well.

He felt too close to call him a stranger.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.928
But the face I was so tired of seeing

00:03:01.928 --> 00:03:04.538
wasn't there in the slightest.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.998
Oh, books.

included from the beginning.

You thought I didn't know?

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.878
That's why you're not
family to me either, Dad.

simple questions right now.

If your responses include any lies, we will
have a parent-teacher conference tomorrow.

Excuse me? What kind of thing is that?

00:05:37.048 --> 00:05:41.298
- But parent-teacher conferences...
- So answer well.

But why are you here in the middle of
the night questioning me about my cap?

00:05:59.938 --> 00:06:01.678
Then, shall we do this tomorrow?

00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:04.010
Come to school with your uncle by 8:00 a.m.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.050
It's my older brother's. Why?

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.658
I just borrowed it last
night and tried it on.

00:06:12.658 --> 00:06:18.028
Last night. What was your real reason
for going to Motel Woojeong alleyway?

00:06:18.028 --> 00:06:22.058
I told you. I was just
trying to take a walk...

00:06:22.058 --> 00:06:25.380
If you're getting confused,
I'll ask more specifically.

00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:32.680
Who made you go down that alley, even turning
in the direction you were walking last night?

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.088
The one who was walking with
you and then disappeared by himself.

00:06:38.088 --> 00:06:43.340
The person who made you
lie to me about taking a walk.

00:06:43.988 --> 00:06:46.048
Who was it?

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:06.238
He just asked me to check if the
light was on on the second floor.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.768
Who?

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.908
Who asked you to do that?

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.858
You say it yourself. Who is it?

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.618
The one...

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.608
with my last name.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.228
So it was all Baek Yoo Seop.

00:08:02.228 --> 00:08:05.788
He was curious about where Lee Joo
Young was staying on the second floor.

00:08:05.788 --> 00:08:08.758
He did that even though Lee Joo Young did
not show up at Bong Bong Cafe last night.

00:08:08.758 --> 00:08:13.148
That means he was targeting
Lee Joo Young from the beginning.

00:08:13.148 --> 00:08:18.218
And this incident from last time.
When he escaped from up here.

00:08:18.218 --> 00:08:23.728
That also happened as he was
spying on Lee Joo Young down there.

00:08:23.728 --> 00:08:29.488
So the one with the blue cap, Baek
Yoo Seop, must be the suspect because...

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.098
If you rush ahead like that,
you might get motion sickness.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.328
If Baek Yoo Seop is the culprit,

00:08:43.328 --> 00:08:47.258
we won't need to wait. We
will meet him tomorrow night.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.978
Since he has to...

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.478
kill the second victim.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.788
Are you really prepared to face that?

00:09:08.538 --> 00:09:11.738
You don't need to hide
and suppress how you feel.

00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:14.898
It's natural to struggle and feel pain.

00:09:14.898 --> 00:09:17.288
He's your family in the end.

00:09:46.448 --> 00:09:49.848
It's too awful that I have
such mixed feelings right now.

00:09:52.198 --> 00:09:54.838
But that's all I feel.

00:09:54.838 --> 00:09:57.748
The rest of it...

00:09:57.748 --> 00:10:02.508

save my mom, and you,

00:10:02.508 --> 00:10:07.118
from that horrible human being.

00:10:07.118 --> 00:10:09.258
So that's why...

00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:26.168
Are you going to tell the whole
neighborhood about your mom and me?

00:10:45.718 --> 00:10:48.308
I was just disturbed about Baek Yoo Seop.

00:10:48.308 --> 00:10:51.438
No one knows him better than I do.

00:10:51.438 --> 00:10:56.038
From now on, I will fill in your
missing data and information.

00:10:56.038 --> 00:10:58.008
From now on,

we don't know what we will come across.

00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:04.258
Are you sure you can handle this?

Yes.

if it's the truth I need to find out,

00:11:24.338 --> 00:11:27.118
I'm not going to run away from it.

00:11:27.818 --> 00:11:30.648

00:12:02.178 --> 00:12:05.758
Yes. I brought your change of clothes, Mom.

00:12:12.868 --> 00:12:15.168
What should we do now?

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:20.980
You should know first
who the second victim is.

00:12:21.578 --> 00:12:23.698
Who is it?

00:12:39.618 --> 00:12:45.658

Nice to meet you.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.838
No way.

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:11.338
You really had no idea?

00:13:11.338 --> 00:13:14.098
You met an aunt you had never met before.

00:13:14.098 --> 00:13:20.288
I was told she was weak and
died at a young age of an illness.

00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:27.508
Is there anything else
you haven't told me yet?

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:32.988
I showed you upstairs, so
now you know everything.

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:39.428
You have a plan this time, too. Right?

00:13:39.428 --> 00:13:43.138
Do you think it's a coincidence
that I found a house facing them?

00:13:44.118 --> 00:13:46.408
Then from the beginning, you...

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:14.108
Based on my observation this past month,
today will be the most difficult day.

00:14:14.108 --> 00:14:18.888
Because the person we need
to save is no ordinary person.

You should have thought
of this earlier, Kyeong Ae!

00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:03.368
Oh, yes! So I just need
to save a little more...

00:16:03.368 --> 00:16:07.378
Just a little more. Just a little more.

00:16:07.378 --> 00:16:10.638
Just save a little more...

00:16:10.638 --> 00:16:14.658
Just a little more. Just a little more.

00:16:30.518 --> 00:16:35.708
Woojeong Village's mess.
The craziest person in this town.

00:16:35.708 --> 00:16:41.560

[Virture and Benevolence]

00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:46.658
That's why it was the
house across from here.

00:16:46.658 --> 00:16:49.058
Since we don't know where she might go.

00:17:01.098 --> 00:17:07.358
So you're saying we can't really trust even
the route found by the police at the time?

00:17:07.358 --> 00:17:09.888
They missed too many things.

00:17:10.778 --> 00:17:14.428
It became more apparent after last night.

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:25.938
In any case, they reported
the last whereabouts as

00:17:25.938 --> 00:17:29.648
9:00 p.m. tonight at Bong Bong Cafe.

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:32.068
The same as Lee Joo Young. Right?

00:17:33.438 --> 00:17:37.938
She must've run into the
culprit after she left that place.

00:17:42.118 --> 00:17:44.478
But today is different.

00:17:45.348 --> 00:17:48.428
Since we will be there behind her.

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:53.918
This time, we will get it right.

00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:57.758
Yes, we will. Definitely.

00:18:05.058 --> 00:18:06.978
What about school?

00:18:07.598 --> 00:18:09.058
What?

00:18:09.758 --> 00:18:13.478
Fever? 39 degrees?

00:18:13.478 --> 00:18:18.108
Yes, since I'm her only guardian...

00:18:21.558 --> 00:18:25.778
Yes, of course! She should be
going to the hospital, not school!

00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:29.318
Yes, yes, you know the
town intersection. Right?

00:18:29.318 --> 00:18:33.730
Don't even think about your
classes and take good care of her.

00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:36.278
Yes, yes.

00:18:37.148 --> 00:18:39.018
Gosh.

00:18:39.728 --> 00:18:41.958
I don't think you can do it today.

00:18:42.858 --> 00:18:45.248
I can just meet him at the hospital.

00:18:45.248 --> 00:18:48.048
Oh, it's on the way.

00:18:49.768 --> 00:18:52.778
How are your children, by the way?

00:18:52.778 --> 00:18:55.348
Oh, yes. The hospital said they can leave.

00:18:55.348 --> 00:18:57.128
But I'm letting them stay one more day.

00:18:57.128 --> 00:18:59.208
Good, good.

00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:03.128
Buy them whatever they
want to eat while you're at it.

00:19:03.128 --> 00:19:06.228
And let them see your face more often, too.

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:09.778
- Why are you doing this, Director Yoon...
- Just take it.

00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:17.998
If I don't do this, I can't feel good
about seeing my son in a few days.

00:19:18.868 --> 00:19:24.878
I'm the one who didn't let
you leave the other night.

00:19:25.868 --> 00:19:28.698
It's not like you did it on purpose.

00:19:32.468 --> 00:19:35.428
Oh, this tastes like cherry.

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:38.328
Is Yeon Woo returning home now?

00:19:38.328 --> 00:19:40.648
Yes, he called.

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.598
He said he'd come to see his dad.

00:19:45.438 --> 00:19:48.398
It's been three years now.

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:53.298
Be grateful when your
kids act cute in front of you.

00:19:53.298 --> 00:19:56.358
Your children won't
stay by your side forever.

00:19:56.358 --> 00:19:57.728
Yes.

Do you want to try one?

00:20:02.588 --> 00:20:05.608
Oh, yes. Thank you.

00:20:08.558 --> 00:20:10.078
I'm telling you.

00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:14.798
If only I become Miss Korea,
I'll buy you a nice mink coat.

00:20:15.398 --> 00:20:18.918
Geez! This is the kind of child I have!

00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:21.038
You think it's that easy

00:52:48.692 --> 00:52:50.002
Excuse me?

00:52:51.002 --> 00:52:52.582
Here.

00:52:54.842 --> 00:52:58.402
I just took it earlier. You can take it.

00:52:59.282 --> 00:53:00.742
Oh, my!

00:53:00.742 --> 00:53:02.632
Oh, my goodness!

00:53:03.382 --> 00:53:05.032
Oh, my gosh!

00:53:06.262 --> 00:53:08.212
This...

00:53:08.212 --> 00:53:10.422
I mean...

00:53:10.422 --> 00:53:12.602
Can I kiss you?

00:53:12.602 --> 00:53:15.792
- What?
- No, you can't. Get inside!

00:53:21.952 --> 00:53:23.892
Hey, Lee Soon Ae!

00:53:23.892 --> 00:53:29.472
Do you know what happened
to me today because of this?

00:53:30.242 --> 00:53:34.182
- Sis!
- I'm so sorry, Soon Ae.

00:53:34.182 --> 00:53:38.602
- Forgive me.
- I'm sorry!

00:54:16.612 --> 00:54:19.322
Thank you for everything today.

00:54:21.642 --> 00:54:24.222
I didn't see the culprit in the end.

00:54:25.122 --> 00:54:29.802
I was hoping we'd be out of the fog,
but I don't know what else went wrong.

00:54:30.902 --> 00:54:33.892
So now, we only have one more chance.

00:54:38.432 --> 00:54:41.742
But at least things became quite clear.

00:54:41.742 --> 00:54:43.842
That's enough for today.

00:55:54.492 --> 00:55:56.662
Mr. Yoon.

00:55:56.662 --> 00:55:58.472
Yoo Beom Ryong?

00:56:03.463 --> 00:56:05.543
She's dead.

00:56:18.482 --> 00:56:20.902
She's dead, Mr. Yoon.

00:57:43.342 --> 00:57:45.022
What happened?

00:57:45.022 --> 00:57:46.392
You need to explain.

00:57:46.392 --> 00:57:48.662
What you saw. What you did.

00:57:48.662 --> 00:57:50.892
You need to explain
everything from beginning to end.

00:57:50.892 --> 00:57:52.492
So she hadn't left?

00:57:52.492 --> 00:57:55.262
The time and place changed.
But the person is still dead.

00:57:55.262 --> 00:57:57.072
No one had died in that spot.

Everything starts from
scratch, and this is our end.
