WEBVTT

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:29.339
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to Trieste, Italy.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:32.259
Looks like we've got a storm rolling in
off the Adriatic

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:37.431
and a missing CIA agent in room 620
of the Grand Hotel Castelletto.

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:39.516
This is London HQ.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.476
We got a live feed up and running,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.936
and we are good to go.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.647
This is Faraday.
Pickup crew on the sixth floor.

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:48.108
- Agent Hall, you have the field.
- Copy that, boss.

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.569
Pickup team, give the signal
when you're in position.

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:54.740
Forty-five seconds. I wanna be in and out.
Vehicle team, be ready to move.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:55.823
In position.

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:58.493
Remember, I want
this piece of shit alive, Brennan.

00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:01.872
Yeah. What is he,
a ringer on your CIA softball team?

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.123
In position.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:04.708
Try not to shoot the guy.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.002
You wanna pick up the tab
for his minibar too?

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:10.255
Yeah, yeah. Get a receipt.
I'm sure Langley will reimburse.

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:12.966
Okay, everybody. Stand by.

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:17.262
Faraday, ready to breach.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:20.098
- On your knees!
- On the ground!

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:21.058
Area's secure.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.268
- Please don't shoot!
- Contact to target.

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:24.353
Clear!

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:30.901
Hog-tied and ready to ride.

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:36.990
Confirmed. We have the hard drive.

00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:37.908
Go for extraction.

00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:43.622
I changed my mind.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:46.124
I was gonna go to the embassy
and hand myself in.

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:48.919
Well, good news. We saved you a trip.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.712
Traveling on the stairwell.

00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:53.465
- Heads up, Rayner, they're coming to you.
- Copy that.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.263
Five seconds until the exit.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:07.771
Get down!

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.732
What the hell happened?

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.902
Rayner's down! Exit's compromised!
Go out the back.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.278
Copy that.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:17.572
What's going on?!

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:18.656
Let's move!

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.909
What's our play?

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:26.790
- Backup extraction point at the canal!
- Better not lose that intel, Brennan.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.583
Just...

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.732
- He's hit!
- Glover's gone!

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.275
- Call for backup!
- Who is it?

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.384
We're taking fire!

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.220
Hold your position.
I can get ground support in five minutes.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.281
- We can get to the canal in three.
- You'll be in the open.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.986
Seriously, Rox.
You gotta trust me on this.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.769
Okay. Green light.

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:49.312
- Go!
- Let's move! Come on!

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.231
- Get him outta here!
- On me!

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.112
Oh my God! Please!

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.740
Faraday, do you copy?
Nick, do you copy?

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.950
Does anybody copy? Anybody?

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.754
- Faraday, what's your location?
- Nick, where are you?

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.052
I'm at the extraction point.
I have the asset.

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:54.586
…time to go over to Dan
for today's outlook right across Jersey.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.922
Thank you, Mitch. I'm Dan Farrell…

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.927
- Shit.
- I've made you coffee.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:03.636
Thank you.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:05.262
It's to go.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.517
Are you kicking me out?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.478
I'm too old for small talk
in the morning, Michael.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:15.732
Last night was fun,
but… it ain't last night no more.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.944
Goddamn, Nicole. That's cold.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:27.410
Hey. When we first met,
did you ever think we'd hook up?

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:32.290
Uh, I was your seventh grade
English teacher, Mike. So… no.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.875
You always passed me.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:35.584
Hey.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:39.756
Look at you. You're still educating me
all these years later.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.846
I'll see you around, huh?

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.973
I imagine so!

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.104
- Hey, Gary.
- Mike.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.399
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, honey.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.236
That's a really nice suit.
You still working uptown?

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.656
- Gary works at the bank.
- Like as a teller?

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:05.824
Like as a manager.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:06.907
Oh.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.160

Jesus, Ma, you're like the feds.
You got eyes everywhere?

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.776
There's no secrets from your mother.
Not in Jersey.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.988
Is her Gary still working at the bank?

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.199
No, they fired him. He's selling hot dogs
outside The Rock now.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.826
It's kinda sad, actually.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.162
When's the date for Ronnie's wedding?

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.496
A few weeks.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.083
No, I need to know the exact date.
I have to make my appointments.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.169
- For what?
- For the right nail tech.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:03.965
You gotta book these things in advance.
I don't want them to stick me with Josie.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.968
- Oh, not Josie, huh?
- Don't be smart, kid.

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:10.722

- Two weeks from Sunday. Bye.

Mrs. Hoffman?!

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:14.119
Ms. Hoffman, if you don't mind.
And, yes, I did. Twice.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.037
- Wow.
- One and a half times at least.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.706
I don't remember her from school.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:20.333
If you didn't cut class every day,
maybe you'd remember.

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:23.169
If older women are your thing,
I know a couple of smoke shows

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.130
that play mahjong with my grandmother.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.589
I'd love to date your grandmother.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.553
If you don't mind
having dinner at 4:30.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.385
- Oh!
- Why so late?

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.138
Hey, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no. I got this.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.015
How, brother? You're as broke as me.

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:37.892
First, nobody's as broke as you.
You can barely pay attention.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:41.521
And secondly, I got an advance today,
so it's all good.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:42.897
- Thanks, Mike.
- Yeah.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.316
- All right. I gotta drain the hog!
- You do that.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.485
I didn't know you got an advance.
Good for you.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.822
What is this guy, dumb and ugly?
There's no advance. I'm broke as shit.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:54.325
Billy's out of work. We'll split this.
Come on. Break out the lunch money.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.121
Gotta be honest, Rox.
Not sure why this is our man.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.248
I got a good feeling about him, boss.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:04.169
If he's anything like that guy I remember,
he's exactly who we need.

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:07.047
- Hey, Jimmy. I need another.
- Sure thing, Mike.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:16.765
First one to get a peanut in the glass
behind the bar buys the other one a drink.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:19.726
Holy shit.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:21.644
Hiya, Mikey.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.607
Roxanne Hall. What are you doing here?

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.359
What does it look like I'm doing here?
I'm getting a drink!

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.405
- So, what, you're here by yourself?
- Yeah.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:35.950
- Uh…
- No.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.034
Date night?

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:41.247
I'm sorry. It's just…
it's just this is such a surprise, is all.

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.375
What's a surprise to me is you still got
the same haircut since high school.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.044
Hey, hey, don't knock Supercuts.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.354
- Two shots, please.
- You got it.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.858
- You can handle your liquor now?
- I always handled my liquor.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.176
I got a vomit-stained tuxedo
that says different, but...

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.180
Wait, you still got your tuxedo
from high school?

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.346
- Yeah.
- Really?

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.555
And it still fits.

00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:59.057
Ah.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.142
This is so crazy.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:04.437
I mean, I just… I pictured you walking
through that door a thousand times.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:05.647
Is it as you imagined?

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.690
In my head,
you were always wearing a bikini, but…

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.363
Do you still breakdance
outside the rec center?

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.741
Every Saturday. And you know what?
The girls still love it too.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.910
I don't remember any girls lovin' it.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.889
- What about Isabella Mingarelli?
- She only liked you 'cause I liked you.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.707
- You know this.
- No, she liked my moves. You know, that…

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:31.339
Oh my God.
She has six kids with Matty Museo.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.217
- And another one on the way.
- What about you?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.486
- What about me?
- You got kids?

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.846
Do I have kids?
No, I don't have any... Do you?

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.806
Well, I don't know. None that I know of.

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.854
Looks like
you're losing your touch.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.189
I forgot how good
these disco fries actually were.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:51.359
You forgot about a lot of good things
when you went off to college.

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.444
I guess Paterson didn't suit you, huh?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.824
- I don't think college did either.
- I heard about that.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:58.907
Yeah?

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.119
What'd you hear?

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:05.331
You got into a fight with the point guard
of the basketball team before the finals.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.916
Broke his jaw. Got kicked out.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.211
Well, actually, he was the center,
and I broke his nose.

00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:13.173
Well, you can take the girl out of Jersey.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.759
No, no, no. Wait. What happened was
he took my best friend on a date.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:18.636
She couldn't remember a thing
in the morning.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.390
People at school didn't care,
so… what happened happened.

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.392
So you threw away your college career?

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.018
Nope.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:27.603
Traded it in.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.229
For what?

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:33.193
For doing the right thing.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.654
What do you say we… call it a night?

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:40.408
What? No, we're just having fun.
You don't wanna finish the game?

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:42.327
I didn't say end the night, Mike.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.494
I mean let's

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:46.247
take it somewhere else.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.208
Oh.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.173
Oh shit!

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.176
Whoa!

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:00.762
If I'd known we were gonna do
the Gumball Rally,

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.180
I'd have had less disco fries!

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.356
Wow, look at this place.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.317
Remember that bench right there?

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.424
Where you first told me you loved me.

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:20.323
I was always trying to do
romantic stuff like that.

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:23.076
I'd do anything to make you smile.

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:29.624
Oh! I got... I gotta take this.
If it wasn't important...

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:32.418
- Mike.
- It's gonna take one second. One second.

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:36.129
Hang on.

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:38.007
Just one second.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.012
- Oh no!
- Come on. You loved this song.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.138

I wasn't dumb.

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:58.152
- Naive.
- Yeah.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:12:59.821
- Naive.
- Naive.

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:00.904
Yeah.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.449
God, I wish you hadn't left like you did.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.952
- Sh-sh-sh! No, don't talk about that.
- All right.

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:07.954
Don't mess this up, Mikey. Come on.

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:09.330

Hmm.

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.307

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:38.109
Yeah, something like that.

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:43.281

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:33.831
Morning.

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.334
Welcome to London, Mikey.

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.295
Rox, what the hell?
Where… where did Jersey go?

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.923
Oh, it didn't go anywhere. You did.

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:43.507
What?

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:46.803
No, no, no. We were… we were at the Point.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:50.640
Remember I was being very charming?
"Jersey Girl" was playing...

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.934
And then I injected you
with a tranquilizer

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:55.895
and transported you here
via freight to the UK.

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.940
No, no. I should be at work.

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:02.110
I can't... I can't be late again.
My foreman's gonna kill me.

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:23.381
Hell of a wake-up call, huh, Mike?

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.717
- Who are you?
- Tom Brennan.

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:28.177
Local 12-25.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:29.595
- What?
- I'm Roxanne's boss.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.889
Although, sometimes,
it does not feel like that.

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.724
I'm a diligent follower of orders, boss.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.269
Yeah, just not always the ones I'm giving.

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:38.020
What kind of think tank is this?

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:41.357
Think tank. That's good.
I usually tell people I'm a pilot.

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:43.067
He's got the hat and everything.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.903
- What?
- Let me buy you breakfast. You drive.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:48.238
Rox, what…

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:52.243
- I need some answers.
- Okay, what do you wanna know?

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:54.120
What do you mean? Am I being kidnapped?

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:56.247
One way you can tell
if you're being kidnapped

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.084
is if a guy tosses you the keys
to a $200,000 sport utility vehicle

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.086
and offers to buy you breakfast.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.758
I normally jimmy this shit
with a screwdriver.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:10.761
- Where... There's no place to put the key.
- Mike.

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:13.347
Right there.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.561
Somebody needs to tell me
what the hell is going on.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.771
Will do, Mike. Take a right.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.866
You might wanna try
driving on the right side.

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.569
Oh shit! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shit!

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.279
What the...

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.020
- The hell is he doing?
- The right side is the left side.

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:34.744
Do you know how confusing you sound?

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.621
- First time in London?
- What do you think?

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:39.207
His first time
out of the tristate area.

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:43.294
So you don't work
for an international think tank?

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:45.505
Nope. We work for the Union.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:46.422
What union?

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.883
Half the intelligence community
don't know we exist.

00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:52.178
- The other half regret finding out.
- You guys the FBI or something?

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:54.013
Yeah, except we do all the work,

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.682
and we don't wear coats
with our name in big yellow letters.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.893
That sounds exciting for you,
but why am I here?

00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:01.062
Because two nights ago, in Trieste, Italy,

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:04.649
a Union mission
to intercept a CIA turncoat went south.

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:06.493
- That's why I'm in London?
- Yep.

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:07.401
Basically.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:11.322
I'm sorry for being a little slow here,
but you have to fill in the blanks, okay?

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.324
Tell you what makes the Union unique.

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:15.451
We don't recruit
out of Princeton or Harvard.

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:19.705
We're not looking to tap the Yale skulls
or the Oxford tennis team.

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:22.041
We're looking for people
that fly under the radar.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:24.460
An invisible army
that keeps the world running.

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:28.047
People who do the actual work.
Street smarts over book smarts.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.424
Blue collar, not blue blood.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.719
People that build our cities,
keep production lines humming.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.847
That's who we are… and we get shit done.

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:39.517
People like us
are expected to get shit done

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.270
'cause nobody ever handed us
anything a day in our lives.

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:44.230
What he said.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:50.194
Hey, Maggie. We'll have three bacon rolls
and three black coffees for takeaway.

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.571
Ketchup or brown sauce?

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.155
Just ketchup, thank you.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.741
- What the hell is a brown sauce?
- I have no idea.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.619
Those guys over there, they work for you?

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.783
If they did,
you wouldn't have noticed 'em.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:04.542
So look here. This is Derek Mitchell.
Former CIA analyst.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.544
He was on the run
with top secret information.

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.504
- Guy you were tryin' to get in Trieste?
- Yep.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.468
- Yeah, Trieste.
- Except you guys messed it up.

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:13.009
Yeah, we messed it up.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:17.013
Now Mitchell has a hole
where his face used to be,

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:19.849
the intel is in the wind,
and we are up shit creek.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:22.268
Know what they call that?

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:26.272
I don't know.
Space Needle? Harry Potter Wand?

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:29.108
The BT Tower.
You know what the Union call it?

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:31.736
Home.

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:38.117
Look in here, Mike.

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.164
How did they get all of my shit like that?

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:44.665
Check this out.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.835
Juliet Quinn, AKA the Auctioneer.

00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:50.546
We found out she's selling the intel
on the black market in London

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.882
on behalf of a mystery seller.

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:56.802
The mystery seller being whoever killed
your guys and stole the intel.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.305
Those are the kind of details
you're gonna have to remember

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:00.765
if you wanna pass the test.

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:02.642
- What test?
- The entrance test.

00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:03.643
I don't like tests.

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:07.688
- Same thing?
- Yeah.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:09.190
Wow! Holy shit!

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:12.233
Whoa.

00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:16.697
In two weeks, that stolen intel's
gonna be sold at a black market auction

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.616
that we need to be a part of.

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.119
- That's where you come in.
- Hey, Athena.

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:24.163
What's he talking about, where I come in?

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:27.166
- Any underlying medical issues?
- Not that I know of.

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.502
Are you on any medications presently?

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:30.961
I got tranquilized last night.

00:19:31.045 --> 00:19:32.526
- I don't know if that counts.
- Nope.

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:35.216
Hey, what did you mean by
"that's where I come in"?

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:39.261
That intel Mitchell stole
wasn't launch codes or blueprints

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:40.846
for some secret missile base.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:44.725
It was… information
about every man and woman

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.561
who has ever served
a Western-allied country.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.357
Every local cop,
every rifleman in the marines.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.070
Every spook at MI5, MI6… FBI, CIA,

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:57.905
and, yeah, the Union.

00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.990
That intel gets into the wrong hands,

00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:02.702
our ability to protect the public
is history.

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.913
Here's the rub, Mike.
We need somebody clean.

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:08.374
If I send in somebody
that could turn up as Miss July

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:11.752
on the FBI's
most promising agents calendar this year,

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:15.464
they're gonna get their head blown off,
and the mission is DOA.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.884
So we need somebody with no history.

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:21.303
Basically, we need a nobody.

00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:22.430
Correct.

00:20:23.097 --> 00:20:24.097
After you.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.727
Hey, what's up, big man?

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:29.937
Oh, what the... Rox, what the hell?

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.148
- You're a tough guy, huh?
- What? Hey!

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.357
Yeah, that's right.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:34.734
- Bro. What?
- What's up, man?

00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:37.820
Let me see how tough you are now.
Too pretty to be a tough guy.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:39.506
Don't let the pretty face fool you.
I'm from the street.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:43.284
Yeah? Which street is that?
Sesame Street?

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:49.457
- Keep the new guy in one piece.
- There you go. Oh, you want some more?

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.667
Come on at me, Elmo.
Let's see what you got.

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.043
Hey, hey, hey!

00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:56.547
Yeah, I can work with this.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.091
This is Frank Pfeiffer,
physical specialist.

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.927
You were about to say you're not sure
if you're the guy for this,

00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:03.971
and honestly, I think that's a good sign.

00:21:04.054 --> 00:21:07.641
I'm not sure either,
but Roxanne believes you can do it, so…

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:11.270
You got till the end of the day
to make up your mind, okay?

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:20.279
You need a nobody, huh?
Why don't you get one of these people?

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:23.949
- I didn't mean that, Mike.
- No, you meant a nobody in a good way.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:28.913
I mean, just yesterday, I'm waking up
next to Nicole Hoffman in Paterson.

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.623
I hadn't thought about you in forever.

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:33.501
Today, I'm in London, and you're asking me
to risk my life for you?

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:36.212
- None of this makes any sense.
- Wait. Let me get this straight.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.714
You had sex
with our seventh grade English teacher?

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:41.842
- That is not the point, Roxanne.
- What is the point, Mike?

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:44.512
Why me? You haven't seen me in 25 years.

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:48.182
A guy who can be on a tiny beam
a thousand feet in the air

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:51.185
and keep his cool,
who used to be an all-star athlete.

00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:53.437
A guy I remembered I could count on.

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:56.023
But I'm supposed to count on you.
You dropped out of my life.

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:58.943
I went to college!
Let's not make this thing overly dramatic.

00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:00.903
No, no. You disappeared.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.488
That was the Union. That wasn't me.

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:04.907
I didn't know that.
How was I supposed to know that?

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.784
I'm sorry.

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:10.496
We're not asking you
for a lifetime commitment here.

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:12.748
It's one operation. That's it.

00:22:21.924 --> 00:22:25.594
Look, first-class ticket to Newark,
leaves tonight.

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.805
You could be back
in Wilson's bar tomorrow.

00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:31.141
Same bar, same stool, same friends.
Your choice.

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:53.706
Oh!

00:22:58.752 --> 00:22:59.837
Roxanne Hall?

00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:02.715
Wait. Wa... Ma, how do you know that?

00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:04.258
- I know everything.
- Look.

00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:06.677
I know you must be worried,
but I can explain.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.470
I always liked her for you.

00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:10.598
She's pretty and smart.

00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:13.642
Comes from a good family. Ambitious.

00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:15.686
- What is she up to?
- Nothing, okay? Can I...

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.021
Are you coming home?

00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:21.942
Ah, the look on your face is telling me
that the answer is no!

00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:25.738
And, yes,
I can hear the look on your face.

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:27.114
I'm your mother.

00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:29.617
Oh my God, Ma.
They should've recruited you.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.328
All right. Listen, I gotta go, Mikey.

00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:33.954
Give Roxanne a hug from me,

00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:37.249
and don't leave your best man speech
till the last minute.

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.209
Wait. Ma, I...

00:23:58.771 --> 00:23:59.813
Thanks, man.

00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:06.736
I'm in.

00:24:07.488 --> 00:24:09.198
Just call me the Jersey James Bond.

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:10.658
Double O "Go fuck yourself"?

00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:12.326
Exactly.

00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:15.829
Normally, we'd put you through
a six-month training program

00:24:15.913 --> 00:24:18.749
of everything you need to know
to be a Union agent,

00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:20.542
but, unfortunately,
we only have two weeks.

00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:22.795
So we're gonna have to do
the best we can, Mike.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.131
- Any allergies?
- Nope.

00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:27.257
Any phobias?

00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:29.343
Heights? Spiders?

00:24:29.426 --> 00:24:30.844
- Commitment?
- Nope.

00:24:30.928 --> 00:24:32.513
How many fingers can fit in your anus?

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:35.307
- All right, stop.
- I'm doing a psychological profile on you.

00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:37.518
What does my asshole
have to do with psychology?

00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:39.269
Hmm. You should read Freud.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.790
What's your relationship like
with your father?

00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:44.984
Well, he's dead now,
so, you know, we argue a lot less.

00:24:48.696 --> 00:24:49.905
Shit!

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:55.411
Mike, this is, uh… You know what?
Doesn't matter what his name is.

00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:58.288
- We just call him Foreman.
- Why do they call you Foreman?

00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:00.582
- 'Cause I used to be one.
- That makes sense.

00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:04.086
Drove a forklift for an Amazon
distribution center in Fort Worth.

00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:06.505
Cleared 10,000 packages an hour.

00:25:06.588 --> 00:25:09.091
Then I reprogrammed
their entire computer system.

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:12.594
Doubled their productivity, made half
their management level redundant.

00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:15.848
Wow. Well, thank you
for sharing your story with me.

00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:17.766
Sprint to the edge of this building.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.686
If you stop before I tell you to stop,
you fail.

00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:22.521
You slow down, you fail.

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:24.773
You take this off, you fail.

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:27.693
If you let me run off the edge
and fall to my death, do I fail?

00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:28.776
You do.

00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:34.783
This is just like the go-karts in Jersey.
Oh, I got this shit.

00:25:39.413 --> 00:25:40.914
The shit's on the wrong side.

00:25:40.998 --> 00:25:43.625
They don't have go-karts
with the wheel on this side.

00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:44.543
Mike, go again.

00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:46.503
Okay, this is a memory and reflex test.

00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:50.215
I'm gonna read out a series of numbers,
and I want you to repeat them back to me.

00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:51.133
Okay.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:55.137
One, seven, nineteen,
eight, five, three, ten.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.014
One, seven, nine...

00:25:57.097 --> 00:25:58.098
Ow! Jesus!

00:25:58.182 --> 00:26:00.684
Reflex bad. Can you finish the numbers?

00:26:00.768 --> 00:26:02.352
No, I think I forgot.

00:26:02.436 --> 00:26:03.979
Okay. Memory bad.

00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:07.941
Reflex still bad.

00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:09.025
Go!

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:14.073
- Fail!
- Damn it!

00:26:14.156 --> 00:26:15.866
It's about trust, Mike.

00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:19.036
{\an8}This guy's about to take a swing at you.
What you doin' wrong?

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:21.330
{\an8}I shouldn't have been
talking to his girlfriend.

00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:28.170

along with a verifiable bank account.

How dangerous is it gonna be?

00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:17.279
- Piece of cake.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.656

- Your five million dollars.
- Oh shit.

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:10.980
Thank you, darling.

00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:14.294

Hey, Rox. You there?

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:19.132
- There you are.
- I thought this bag would be heavier.

it was five million in pennies?

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.386
I don't know.

00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:26.348
You know, I actually never asked you.
What does a Union agent get paid?

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.017
Ten dollars an hour and free dental care.

00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:31.246
You wanna lowball a guy
carrying this much of your money?

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.022
You wanna negotiate with a woman
carrying an assault rifle?

00:29:34.106 --> 00:29:36.483
That's actually a good point.

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:39.486

- Weirdo?
- More than a weirdo.

- You're looking for the Auctioneer.
- What?

00:29:58.046 --> 00:30:00.424

- Where's he going?
- Mike!

00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:07.723
Um, we've got no signal
coming from his radio.

00:30:16.857 --> 00:30:20.736
- We got a third team in play, people.
- Shit. We got company.

00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:30.704
Who's got eyes on him?

00:30:30.787 --> 00:30:34.041
We've got definite hostiles
moving down Earlham Street.

00:30:34.124 --> 00:30:35.417

00:30:41.923 --> 00:30:43.800
They've passed Monmouth Street.

00:30:48.722 --> 00:30:50.057
I'm on my way to Mike.

00:30:52.768 --> 00:30:53.977
They're in there, mate.

00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:57.314
Taxi!

- Hello?
- Good afternoon, Mr. Weston.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.762
Where's he at?

00:31:28.845 --> 00:31:32.015
Looks like he's gone into a pub.
Martin's Row, behind the hotel.

00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:33.225
Behind the hotel?

00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:35.060
Okay.

00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:37.312

00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:38.772

00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:45.946
Uh, it's "a voice crying out
in the wilderness," actually.

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:47.948
Third team has mobile assets.

00:31:48.031 --> 00:31:51.952
Come on, come on. Somebody get there.
We gotta put this fire out, people.

00:31:52.035 --> 00:31:54.955
I did a little digging into you,
Mr. Weston.

00:31:55.038 --> 00:31:56.038
And?

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:58.125
I didn't find much.

00:31:59.042 --> 00:32:01.670
Well, I guess I'm not that fond
of paper trails, huh?

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:03.630
A man after my own heart.

00:32:03.713 --> 00:32:05.882
Now if you proceed
to the gentlemen's bathroom,

00:32:05.966 --> 00:32:08.093
you'll find further instructions in there.

00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:09.553

00:32:09.636 --> 00:32:12.472

00:32:13.223 --> 00:32:14.433
Shit.

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:23.775
You must be further instructions.

00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:26.069
This is Ricky.
He's going to count the money.

00:32:26.153 --> 00:32:27.320
Are you carrying a gun?

00:32:27.904 --> 00:32:28.780
Yes, I am.

00:32:28.864 --> 00:32:31.950
Well, take it out… and put it on the side.

00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:39.166
Hey!

00:32:55.015 --> 00:32:57.684
- So where are you from?
- Pat... Um…

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:00.645
Boston.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.442

00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:07.277
Yeah.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.570
It's my favorite movie.

00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:10.154
No shit.

00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:14.117
A man from the hood,
but he's good at counting.

00:33:14.618 --> 00:33:17.621
Yeah. That spoke to me, you know?

00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:20.290
Nice seeing yourself
reflected on screen. I get that.

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:26.254
- Looks good.
- Excellent.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.467
But what now? Where's the device?

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.635
You're holding it.

00:33:34.763 --> 00:33:36.723
I guess we don't get
to meet in person, huh?

00:33:36.806 --> 00:33:39.392
Good luck in the auction, Mr. Weston.

00:33:39.476 --> 00:33:40.727
That was a piece of cake.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.480
Might be due for a promotion
or at least a beer, huh?

00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.819
- Holy shit. Who was that?
- Piece of cake, huh?

00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:51.613
Get down!

00:33:56.952 --> 00:33:59.204
- When I say get down, get down.
- I am down.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.920
Foreman, where's the backup?

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:10.840
Let's go!

00:34:20.141 --> 00:34:21.851
Holy shit. Who are these guys?

00:34:21.935 --> 00:34:25.021
I wouldn't bother learning their names.
Mike, go!

00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:28.275
- Are you sure?
- Yes! Take the device! Go!

00:34:49.796 --> 00:34:51.715
Then listen to your teacher.

00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:53.216
Repeat after me.

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:54.925

00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:17.616

Shit. I'm running!
This place is like a damn labyrinth!

00:36:09.209 --> 00:36:10.043
Yeah!

00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:11.044
Oh shit.

00:36:12.462 --> 00:36:14.923
Oh God. All right, I'm okay.

00:36:19.803 --> 00:36:21.846
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Miss! Miss, hey!

00:36:26.142 --> 00:36:27.477
You gotta be kidding. What...

00:37:12.355 --> 00:37:13.440
Hey! Help!

00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:25.702
Rox, watch out!

00:37:43.887 --> 00:37:44.887
Holy shit.

00:37:55.398 --> 00:37:57.859
Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go.

00:38:01.738 --> 00:38:04.324
Let's roll.

00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:15.794
Shit.

00:38:21.049 --> 00:38:22.300
I'm sorry.

00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:32.267
Hey.

00:38:32.769 --> 00:38:35.480
- It's totally busted.
- You can't get anything from it?

00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:38.316
Well, the microchip,
the iOS, it's just totally fried.

00:38:38.399 --> 00:38:41.569
It's like somebody fell on it
and dropped it in a sink or somethin'.

00:38:42.237 --> 00:38:44.072
- So go tell him.
- No, you tell him.

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:46.241
- You tell him.
- You go tell him.

00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:48.660
Yeah. They had these, boss.

00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:51.579
- Makarovs. So Russians, right?
- Yep.

00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:52.497
Thanks, man.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.834
My guess is Moscow is tracking
everybody else in this auction.

00:38:55.917 --> 00:38:58.753
Easier to kill the opposition
than outbid 'em.

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:03.299
Let me tell you something, man.
My first day in the field…

00:39:03.967 --> 00:39:05.426
…I got my ass kicked too.

00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:07.135
Yeah?

00:39:07.595 --> 00:39:08.638
Not by a woman.

00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:14.686
Not that there's anything wrong with that,
you understand… Just clarifying.

00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:18.106
You know what? I think we got a leak.

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.023
Think about it.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.026
First Trieste, now this.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.653
We don't have a leak.

00:39:23.736 --> 00:39:25.446
I trust everybody in this room.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:26.906
As far as what happened today,

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:29.367
there's at least five other groups
in this thing.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:32.161
They'd all do whatever the hell it takes
to get that intel.

00:39:32.245 --> 00:39:35.498
So we gotta assume it's open season
on everybody in this auction.

00:39:35.582 --> 00:39:36.875
We ain't in the auction.

00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:39.627
I mean, not anymore,
not without a working device, so…

00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:42.338
Okay, but look.
There's five other groups, right?

00:39:42.422 --> 00:39:45.216
So that means
there's five other devices out there.

00:39:45.717 --> 00:39:49.679
So if we can't fix ours,
then… why don't we steal another one?

00:39:49.762 --> 00:39:51.931
I mean, would that work?

00:39:52.015 --> 00:39:53.015
In theory.

00:39:53.683 --> 00:39:54.517
Possibly.

00:39:54.601 --> 00:39:56.728
The security of the Western world
depends on it,

00:39:56.811 --> 00:39:59.063
not to mention the future
of this organization,

00:39:59.147 --> 00:40:01.816
so I guess "in theory, possibly"
is gonna have to do.

00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:05.403
The auction takes place
in less than 48 hours.

00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:07.739
Let's all go home and get some rest, huh?

00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:09.282
Rox, can I have a word?

00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:18.791
Seems serious.

00:40:21.044 --> 00:40:22.837
Ronnie's wedding.

00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:26.758
I'm the best man. I'm supposed to be
planning a bachelor party.

00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:29.594
Real-life stuff, huh?

00:40:30.178 --> 00:40:31.763
So are you gonna jab me again?

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:35.016
Come on, Mike.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:37.977
I know why we're here.
Brennan wants you to send me home, right?

00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:40.521
Yeah. Well, you're not wrong.

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:43.816
Maybe it's better you just go home.
Stay alive.

00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:47.487
Seriously, you took a chance on me,
and it didn't work out,

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.280
but I don't like
letting other people down.

00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:52.533
You did good. You did everything
you were supposed to do.

00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:55.161
The mission just fell apart.
Not your fault.

00:40:55.244 --> 00:40:58.289
I just wanna see it through
to prove you didn't make a mistake.

00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:01.584
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:03.878
You gonna give me another chance?

00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:10.760
- Could we have two tequilas, please?
- Coming up.

00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:13.554
He's not gonna
slip me anything, is he?

00:41:14.973 --> 00:41:17.976
Let's drink to it. To second chances.

00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:24.607
Intelligence gathering indicates
the other groups in the auction represent

00:41:24.691 --> 00:41:28.069
China, North Korea,
Syria, Russia, and Iceland.

00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:30.238
Iceland?

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.281
Just kidding. It's Iran. It's always Iran.

00:41:32.949 --> 00:41:33.950
Who can we get to?

00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:37.537
None of them are gonna be easy,
but hired muscle is like anything else.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:41.416
You get what you pay for,
and North Korea… pays shit.

00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:46.421
Oh. Well, they don't look very Korean.
I would know because I'm Korean.

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:49.173
Very astute, Athena.
They are, in fact, not Korean.

00:41:49.257 --> 00:41:50.967
They are very Eastern European.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.469
Former Soviet Bloc mercenaries
is what they are.

00:41:53.553 --> 00:41:56.389
Our comms unit triangulated a signal,
and, uh,

00:41:56.472 --> 00:41:59.600
they are holed up
in this vacant mansion in Hampstead.

00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:02.364
Foreman, I need you on the ground today.
We're gonna steal a device.

00:42:02.437 --> 00:42:06.357
Let's be sure it's actually the right one.
Roxanne, Frank, you're with Foreman.

00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:07.900
Athena, you got recon.

00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:09.652
Mike, since you're still here,

00:42:09.736 --> 00:42:11.946
I'm guessing Roxanne
didn't listen to me again.

00:42:12.905 --> 00:42:13.905
Rox.

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:16.450
He can handle it.

00:42:16.909 --> 00:42:19.412
All right, Mike.
Your lucky day. Let's move out.

00:42:26.919 --> 00:42:28.337
Surveillance in position.

00:42:28.421 --> 00:42:29.922

Foreman, any luck?

00:43:34.946 --> 00:43:36.364
No device in here.

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:38.074
Okay. One more, guys.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.310
Huh?! Oh!

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.570
Mike!

00:44:27.707 --> 00:44:28.541

00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:05.912
You got it?

00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:07.788
Boom.

00:45:07.872 --> 00:45:08.998
Look at that, huh?

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.420
Wow.

00:45:16.422 --> 00:45:17.422
You did good, Mike.

00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:20.259
Not bad for a nobody, huh?

00:45:21.302 --> 00:45:24.180
We got it. We're on our way out.

00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:29.060
Athena?

00:45:40.446 --> 00:45:41.446
Oh shit.

00:45:41.989 --> 00:45:46.035
Oh no, no, no. Hang in there, sweetie.
Frankie's here, baby. Come on. I got you.

00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:49.163
There we go. Come on. Hey, baby.

00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:52.100
Tell 'em to get the med bay ready.
We're coming in now. Come on, sweetie.

00:45:52.124 --> 00:45:53.167
She's dead, Frank.

00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:01.842
Goddamn it!

00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:18.276
Boss, we've been compromised.
You gotta get out of there.

00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:19.402
Clear the building!

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.002
Oh shit.

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:48.806
Could be the damn Russians again.
Revenge for the Seven Dials.

00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:51.267
No, bro.
How'd they know about our headquarters?

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.436
Someone's got eyes on us.

00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:54.519
Wait.

00:46:56.355 --> 00:46:57.916
- It's Brennan.
- It's Brennan!

00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:58.941
Boss, you okay?

00:46:59.442 --> 00:47:00.651
Yeah, we got it.

00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:03.404
Athena… We lost her.

00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:06.073
Okay.

00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:08.199
You got it.

00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:10.619
Bomb missed most of the control rooms.

00:47:10.703 --> 00:47:14.373
I don't have numbers on the casualties,
but we're still on our feet, just.

00:47:14.457 --> 00:47:15.499
Now what?

00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:17.501
Scatter. Wait for word.

00:47:44.278 --> 00:47:48.157
- This is your safe house?
- Yeah, one of 'em.

00:47:56.999 --> 00:47:57.999
You okay?

00:47:59.752 --> 00:48:00.752
Yup.

00:48:02.046 --> 00:48:03.923
I'm sorry about your friend, Rox.

00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:08.344
I'm here if you wanna talk.

00:48:11.847 --> 00:48:12.847
Yeah.

00:48:28.614 --> 00:48:31.367
- I'll sleep on the chair.
- You can't sleep in the chair.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:33.994
I can make a bed in the corner,
on the floor.

00:48:34.954 --> 00:48:36.622
You can sleep in the bed, Mike.

00:48:55.891 --> 00:48:57.935
It's not really
a safe house, is it?

00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:03.274
It's more like a safe room.

00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:08.487
- Yeah.
- Right?

00:49:08.571 --> 00:49:09.571
Yeah.

00:49:13.993 --> 00:49:16.245
You gonna hog the blankets
like you always did?

00:49:18.164 --> 00:49:19.498
I didn't hog the blankets.

00:49:20.666 --> 00:49:22.960
- Oh yeah, you did.
- Oh no, I didn't.

00:49:23.043 --> 00:49:23.878
Oh, you did.

00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:25.379
No, I didn't.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:30.009
You did. And… …you snore too.

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:36.056
I didn't snore. You snored.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.726
- No, you snored. You always snored.
- No, you snored.

00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:40.186
You snored.

00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:42.271
- What are you, five?
- You're five.

00:49:44.732 --> 00:49:45.941
Go to sleep, silly.

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:51.489
And just for the record,

00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:54.408
I'm not makin' a move on you here.

00:49:56.035 --> 00:49:57.244
Just for the record,

00:49:58.037 --> 00:49:59.037
me either.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.129
Officials say
it was an electrical spark

00:50:07.213 --> 00:50:10.799
that triggered the explosion
at the iconic London landmark last night.

00:50:10.883 --> 00:50:13.427
Several people were taken to hospital
for their injuries,

00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:16.472
but so far, there have been
no reported deaths from the accident.

00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:19.016
Electrical spark?
That's the best they could come up with?

00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:21.519
Almost sounds believable, huh?

00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:25.147
Brennan called.
The auction's at 1800 hours. Let's get it.

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:29.735
The next station is Queensway.

00:50:29.818 --> 00:50:32.655
Please mind the gap
between the train and the platform.

00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:04.562
Good to see you, boss.

00:51:05.312 --> 00:51:08.190
Good to be seen. Some of us got lucky.

00:51:08.983 --> 00:51:09.983
Yeah.

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:12.778
What's the body count?

00:51:13.862 --> 00:51:17.533
Let's, uh… let's focus on that
after we punch back, okay?

00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:19.075
Okay.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.454
Well, looks like it's up and running.

00:51:22.538 --> 00:51:24.665
Activated last night.
Foreman's working on it.

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:27.626
We should be able to track Quinn's signal
as soon as the auction starts,

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.086
but then we gotta make sure

00:51:29.169 --> 00:51:31.672
the bidding lasts long enough
to get the exact location.

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:34.675
If the buy-in's five million dollars,
how much will the bidding go up to?

00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:36.552
Like, enough to buy the Knicks

00:51:36.635 --> 00:51:39.263
and pay somebody
to teach 'em how to play basketball.

00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:41.557
Holy shit. Who's floating the cash?

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.640
We are.

00:51:43.976 --> 00:51:44.976
Who are you?

00:51:45.019 --> 00:51:46.061
I'm the CIA.

00:51:46.145 --> 00:51:48.814
And we're funding
tonight's little dance,

00:51:48.897 --> 00:51:50.899
so if you could grab Quinn and the intel

00:51:50.983 --> 00:51:55.404
before the US government finance
the 401K of every foreign hostile

00:51:55.487 --> 00:51:59.575
between here and Pyongyang,
well, then we sure would appreciate it.

00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:03.162
Get the intel,
you live to fight another day.

00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:06.081
Screw it up, that's the Union done.

00:52:08.917 --> 00:52:10.794
Where can I get a coffee around here?

00:52:33.942 --> 00:52:35.778
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:52:35.861 --> 00:52:37.946
Welcome to tonight's auction.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.198
Okay. Foreman.

00:52:39.281 --> 00:52:40.574
Just started.

00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:43.160
- Roxanne?
- Moving into position now.

00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:46.497
- Had any disco fries today, Mike?
- Nope.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.625
Great. They're not as good
the second time around.

00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:51.919
Some things can be.

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:55.547
With only one item on the docket,
we'll begin bidding straightaway

00:52:55.631 --> 00:52:58.175
at the opening price
of 100 million dollars.

00:52:58.258 --> 00:53:00.678
- I have 100 million. 125.
- Hey, Bezos?

00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:04.390
If you don't wanna be working a forklift
on Monday, get the damn tracker working!

00:53:04.473 --> 00:53:06.600
- Um, almost there.
- Come on now.

00:53:06.684 --> 00:53:08.227
It's my boss.

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:09.310
150 million.

00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:13.399
He probably wants to know if he needs
to sell one of the states to pay for this.

00:53:13.899 --> 00:53:16.151
I think we could lose Idaho.
Nobody'd notice.

00:53:16.235 --> 00:53:18.654
- I'm from Idaho.
- You think I don't know that?

00:53:19.738 --> 00:53:21.115
We got a signal yet?

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.243
- 175 million.
- Right. Here we go.

00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:25.536
Showtime.

00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:29.081
Getting the lockdown
on the location. Rox, start heading east.

00:53:29.164 --> 00:53:30.164
Got it.

00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:41.009
200 million dollars.

00:53:41.093 --> 00:53:43.262
It's narrowing down
to the Southwark area.

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:46.640
A heads-up
would be nice, Rox.

00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:50.477
Hold on, Mike.

00:53:52.187 --> 00:53:53.981
250 million.

00:53:56.734 --> 00:53:58.777
Do I have 275?

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:05.075
275 million.

00:54:05.743 --> 00:54:07.453
I hope you know what you're doing.

00:54:07.536 --> 00:54:09.204
300 million dollars.

00:54:09.288 --> 00:54:10.456
Not my money.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.879
325 million.

00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:24.261
Do I have an advance on 325 million?

00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:27.306
Do I have 350 million?

00:54:27.389 --> 00:54:29.850
- Dude.
- Um, it's calibrating. I need more time.

00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:32.269
Do I have 350?

00:54:32.352 --> 00:54:35.731
- Okay
- 350 million dollars.

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:39.026
Do I have 375?

00:54:43.822 --> 00:54:44.948
Going once.

00:54:47.201 --> 00:54:49.870
- Brennan.
- What do you want me to do? My bid is in.

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:52.331
You know how an auction works?
I can't bid against myself.

00:54:52.414 --> 00:54:53.499
Going twice.

00:54:56.543 --> 00:54:58.504
I have 375 million.

00:54:58.587 --> 00:55:00.672
We're still alive, Rox.
Net closin' in.

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:05.687
They're somewhere
near St. Paul's.

00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:07.387
Two minutes out.

00:55:08.013 --> 00:55:10.015
Okay, we're close. We've got a location.

00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:12.976
About to locate the building.

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:15.187
- 425 million.
- No. No. What happened?

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:18.273
- Uh, shit, it's buffering.
- "Shit, it's buffering."

00:55:18.857 --> 00:55:20.067
Where to, Foreman?

00:55:20.567 --> 00:55:23.320
This is your computer guy?
He looks like the janitor.

00:55:23.403 --> 00:55:25.048
- Can we get a young person?
- Hold on, man!

00:55:25.072 --> 00:55:26.633
- I'll do it myself.
- Going twice.

00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:29.910
- How do you work this thing?
- What are you doin'? Don't do...

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:33.580
- New bid at 550 million dollars.
- Shit. I...

00:55:33.664 --> 00:55:35.584
- There goes Boise.
- Connection's back.

00:55:36.124 --> 00:55:39.837
- Rox, she's in Nicholls Avenue.
- Nice job, Foreman.

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:45.550
Roxanne?

00:55:46.426 --> 00:55:48.720
- We're closin' in.
- Right, you're a block away.

00:55:48.804 --> 00:55:50.973
Do I have 575 million?

00:55:51.056 --> 00:55:52.641
There! Rooftop level.

00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:17.416
Six hundred million dollars.

00:56:17.499 --> 00:56:21.003
Do I have any advance
on six hundred million dollars?

00:56:21.086 --> 00:56:22.754
How about zero dollars,

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:26.008
and I don't advance this bullet
through your skull?

00:56:26.091 --> 00:56:27.091
Damn.

00:56:27.134 --> 00:56:29.177
That concludes tonight's bidding.

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.433
Roxanne Hall.

00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:38.395
I'm surprised they let the Union
stay involved after Trieste.

00:56:38.478 --> 00:56:42.357
After six of our people got killed,
we don't pass this to nobody else.

00:56:42.441 --> 00:56:45.652
You shouldn't let this job
get too personal. Clouds the judgment.

00:56:45.736 --> 00:56:47.195
It's all personal.

00:56:48.864 --> 00:56:51.867
Mr. Weston, how duplicitous of you.

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:55.746
It's Mike McKenna.
Jersey branch. Where's Ricky tonight?

00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:57.873
He has his yoga class on Tuesdays.

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:02.419
- Where's the intel, Quinn?
- You know you can call me Juliet, darling.

00:57:02.502 --> 00:57:06.048
I'll be callin' you "that bitch I buried
in London" if you don't start talkin'.

00:57:06.548 --> 00:57:10.302
You see, this is why
I hate dealing with the agencies.

00:57:10.886 --> 00:57:13.138
Everything always starts at a ten,
doesn't it?

00:57:13.221 --> 00:57:14.848
Shoulda seen her in high school.

00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:18.352
The intelligence is in a lockbox
in Holland Park.

00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:20.437
I'm… very happy to drive you.

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.688
I'll drive.

00:57:22.564 --> 00:57:24.066
You're in the passenger seat.

00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:27.444
He's in the back
with a gun pointed at your head.

00:57:27.527 --> 00:57:28.528
How's that sound?

00:57:30.072 --> 00:57:31.114
Fabulous.

00:58:11.113 --> 00:58:13.824
Oh, for God's sake.
It's not bloody booby-trapped.

00:58:13.907 --> 00:58:14.907
You can relax.

00:58:20.956 --> 00:58:21.956
Mmm.

00:58:37.014 --> 00:58:38.015
Thank you.

00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:51.569
Is that it?

00:58:52.237 --> 00:58:53.572
Yup, that's it.

00:58:54.489 --> 00:58:55.741
Congratulations.

00:58:57.075 --> 00:58:58.410
Let's go.

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:03.415
- You expecting somebody?
- No.

00:59:19.139 --> 00:59:20.139
Rox.

00:59:22.809 --> 00:59:23.809
Nick.

00:59:24.144 --> 00:59:25.144
Roxanne,

00:59:25.854 --> 00:59:27.439
your life is in danger.

00:59:28.315 --> 00:59:30.484
All of our lives are in danger.

00:59:32.736 --> 00:59:34.863
Please… let me in.

00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:49.586
Well, this evening gets
stranger and stranger.

00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:52.839
Agent Faraday… back from the dead.

00:59:54.174 --> 00:59:57.469
- Nick Faraday. Local 12-25.
- Oh, cool. You're Union.

00:59:57.552 --> 00:59:59.054
- That's right.
- Hi.

00:59:59.137 --> 01:00:03.016
One of the six dead agents in Trieste.
You're looking well for it.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.100
How?

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:07.062
How… how are you still alive, Nick?

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:09.272
The current carried me to the ocean.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.734
Got myself to a doctor,
then got myself here.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.487
Rox, Trieste was a setup.

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:19.699
Someone knew we were coming.
That means there's a leak in the Union.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:23.745
So, what? You were just playing dead
until you figured out who it was?

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.623
- That's right.
- You shoulda told me.

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:29.751
- It was to keep you safe.
- I can keep myself safe, Nick.

01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:31.461
Gimme a name.

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.966
- Tom Brennan.
- No.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.593
The stolen intel has details
on everyone who's ever worked

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:41.221
for the US government
going back to the Cold War,

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.764
including mission logs.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.475
Including classified mission logs.

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:48.937
How much do you know about
Tom Brennan before he set up the Union?

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:51.898
Did you know he used to run black ops
for the CIA?

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.317
Tom Brennan has a history, Rox.

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:57.445
He's done things
our government has felt compelled to bury.

01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:59.948
Things that were never meant
to see the light of day.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:03.243
All right, but if all that was true,
how come you didn't tell me?

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:04.494
I was trying to protect you.

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.789
You spent two weeks pretending to be dead.
Why should she trust you, asshole?

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:09.875
'Cause I'm married to her, asshole.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:12.168
What?

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.380
We're separated.

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:17.423
Really?

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:20.135
- This guy?
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:22.721
I'm sure her dad was pleased as punch
when you walked in.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.431
Bill and I had a great rapport.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:27.642
Oh, Bill? You didn't have to call him
Mr. Hall like everybody else?

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:29.561
Let me tell you about me and Bill.

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:31.956
- Yeah, no, no, no, tell me.
- Hey, we're not gonna do this.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.107
They ought to call this the "Re-union."

01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:36.985
You got proof that it was Brennan?

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:40.030
Proof is in the intel.
And it can't go to Brennan.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:41.823
Who do you suggest giving it to?

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:44.993
Cameron Foster and the CIA are in London
overseeing the operation.

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:46.119
Hand it over to them.

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:48.705
That guy who thinks he's Gary Oldman?
He's full of shit.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:50.289
Listen, new guy.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:53.084
Why don't you bench yourself
and let the grown-ups talk, okay?

01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:56.087
This guy
had all the combat training, right?

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:58.506
Yes, Mike. He'd beat you in a fight.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:00.926
All right, I'll let that slide. This time.

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:03.929
Roxanne, I'm asking you to trust me.

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.640
Brennan will kill for this intel.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.560
Too many Union agents are dead.
I don't wanna see anyone else join them.

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:12.520
Especially not you, baby.

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:17.651
Trieste, the Seven Dials, the HQ.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:20.111
You know it makes sense.

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:22.113
Brennan.

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:24.866
He'll have a track on your location.
We should scatter.

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:26.826
Suppose you want the intel as well?

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.454
No. The CIA can arrange a pickup.

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:32.582
We can rendezvous
at the Albert Bridge at dawn,

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:35.335
and we can pass it over together.
Let them handle this.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.670
What about her?

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.798
Oh, darling.
No, I'm just a simple middleman.

01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.050
Best to cut me loose, I'd say.

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:43.260
Let me handle her.

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:10.245
Rox. Rox!

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:11.496
Come on.

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:13.832
Well, now she's stealing a car.
That's good.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.221
Husband.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.850
Uh-uh. We're not gonna do that.

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:33.893
You didn't wanna tell me you were married?

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:37.188
A, we're separated.
B, I thought he was dead.

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:39.733
Yeah, like ten minutes
before you came to see me.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.860
You drive right to the bar
after the funeral?

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:44.738
- Why would that matter to you?
- You know why it matters to me!

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:48.074
Do you care that I've been married
to somebody in the last 25 years?

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.743
To that asshole? A little bit. I do.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:53.204
Okay. What was that shit about my dad?
"Oh, I bet you call him Mr. Hall."

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:55.415
Like somehow as if my dad was the problem.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.292
If you wanna talk about it, let's talk.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.878
Your father had a problem
because you had a Black girlfriend.

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:01.504
Your dad didn't like me either.

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:03.628
They were being protective.
They were old-fashioned.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.384
Old-fashioned. Let me pull out
my appropriate racism chart,

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:09.971
and let's see where old-fashioned falls
between small-town housewife

01:04:10.055 --> 01:04:12.974
and Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan!

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.480
My dad was an asshole.
I should've said something.

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.440
- Yeah.
- I shoulda done a lot, and I didn't.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.419
But you shoulda told me the truth
before manipulating me into coming here!

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:26.029
I didn't manipulate you. I saved you!

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.948
I came and dragged you
out of your small, little life.

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:31.334
- "My small, little life." Yeah, well.
- Yeah.

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:33.453
I gave you an opportunity
to be a part of something.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:36.790
I gotta tell you, Rox.
It might not be perfect, but it's honest.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:40.960
Yeah. I live in the same house.
I got the same job and the same friends.

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:43.755
And you know why?
'Cause I can count on them.

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:46.299
They'd lie in traffic for me.
I'd do the same for them!

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:49.928
Can you say that about the people
that you have in your life? I doubt it.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.012
But…

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.306
Maybe I can, maybe I can't.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.642
But this is a chance for you, Mike.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:58.353
You wanna go back to Paterson
and throw that all away?

01:04:58.436 --> 01:04:59.604
Oh, just stop, Rox.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:05.402
How come everybody else
can see your potential except for you?

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:08.696
You know, thanks for the advice.
See you at the next high school reunion.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:56.661
Hey, Mikey! Hey, man, where you at?

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:59.372
You are missing an epic bachelor party!

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.583
I know, but I am so sorry. I'm...

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:07.380
Check it out! This ass belongs
to Stephanie Tranata after Sunday!

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.466
- Woo-hoo!
- Whoa... Is that Ronnie?

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:12.010
- Hey, man! Look who it is!
- Mikey!

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:14.137
- Yeah!
- That's my best man!

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:17.599
Ronnie, I promise you, I'm gonna be there
for the wedding, okay? I promise.

01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:19.642
I'm never gonna forgive you, man!

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:21.269
Keep your pants on.

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:24.564
I'm kidding! I'm kidding, bro.
We love you, buddy.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:27.567
Hey, whatever you're doin',
it's gotta be important, right?

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:28.650
- Yeah!
- Right.

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:30.945
You do you, Mikey!

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:36.618
Sorry about that.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.922
What are you doin' here, Mike?

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:34.050
The mission ain't over.
I ain't goin' home.

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:38.179
- You're still an asshole.
- Oh, you've always been an asshole.

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:41.224
- Thanks for coming, Mike.
- No problem.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:42.892
I would have got here a lot sooner,

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.478
but I was standing on the wrong bridge
for 20 minutes.

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:48.398
He should be here.

01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:07.125
So I'm on the bridge, Nick,
and you're not here.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:09.919
I'm guessing this isn't gonna be
great news, is it?

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:13.756
- Afraid I'm not coming, Rox.
- Oh, what? So this was a setup?

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.008
You and Brennan.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:18.303
If you check your bank balance,
you'll see a parting gift

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:21.347
of a quarter of the proceeds
from the buy-in to the auction.

01:08:21.431 --> 01:08:24.309
I had to, uh, cover my escape.

01:08:24.392 --> 01:08:25.768
What about the intel?

01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:28.730
The bags switched back at the house.

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:32.275
I mean, the Iranians did promise
good money for it.

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:35.111
Wouldn't be fair
to leave 'em empty-handed.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.780
And the Union? No loyalty, Nick?

01:08:37.864 --> 01:08:38.948
Yeah, the Union.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:41.159
It sounds good in the beginning, you know?

01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:45.622
Then you save the world a few times,
and there's no credit and no reward.

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:49.083
Brennan's blue-collar bullshit
really started to piss me off

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:52.670
right around the time my wife decided
she'd had enough of me

01:08:53.254 --> 01:08:55.548
just because… I wanted more.

01:08:56.174 --> 01:08:59.469
You didn't have to kill Athena
or bomb the London branch.

01:08:59.552 --> 01:09:02.472
I would've stopped at Trieste
if you guys hadn't been so persistent.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.349
And I was content to play dead forever,

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:07.060
but once you got the Koreans' device,
I had to take the Union out.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.228
Or you and Brennan
would never stop coming after me.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:10.647
You're right about that.

01:09:11.230 --> 01:09:13.566
And that would've
cramped my style, Roxanne.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:15.943
And we wouldn't want that.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.572
- Well, that's disappointing.
- Roxanne.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:26.245
Look here, Nick.

01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:29.207
In the history of men screwin' up,

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.418
you might have just screwed up the worst.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.586
Hmm.

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:36.214
I'll be seeing you, baby.

01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:55.066
Drop the intel. Hit the ground now.

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:57.777
Come on, Foster.
You can't possibly think all this is real.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.363
Agent Hall. Agent…

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:02.281
Mike!

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:06.494
Agent Mike, you got five seconds
before we open fire!

01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:09.414
- Look, when I say go, follow me.
- Follow you? Where?

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:11.666
- Remember the trust exercise?
- Yeah.

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:13.102
- Did I let you die?
- Two.

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:14.585
- Shit. Yeah.
- Remember that.

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:18.172
That shiner, is that what Brennan gave you
while you were handcuffin' him?

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:20.550
Yeah, I know.
He's quite fast for an old man.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:22.760
Maybe prison will slow him down.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:25.304
Yeah, well, he taught me
everything I know.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:29.850
Go!

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.273
Shit!

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:40.111
Oh! Goddamn! Come on! Get out of my way!

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:52.290
I want that goddamned son of a bitch boat
pulled over! No one gets off!

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:54.292
Please halt your vessel.

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:58.045
Sir, please pull your vessel to the shore.

01:10:58.629 --> 01:11:00.882
You have known fugitives on board.

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:10.975
There's Faraday. Right there.

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:15.146
- Oh, you put a track on him?
- Yeah, I put a track on him.

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:17.106
I might be an asshole, but I'm not stupid.

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:20.526
- I didn't mean that. I was just…
- I know. Forget it.

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:21.944
Istria?

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:25.490
Yup. But the truth is, Mike,
the Union is out of the game.

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:26.991
We're on the run from the CIA.

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:29.952
Every cop and every agent in London
is looking for you,

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:33.915
and if you get caught, you're looking
at hard time for treason, so, you know…

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:37.668
Look, I'm not worried about it, all right?
I'm in it as long as you're in.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.717
Okay. All we need to do now
is figure out how we get on a plane.

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:47.929
Are you insane? Ah.

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:49.513
Bobby!

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.893
- What the hell? Where you been?
- Hey, hey, Bobby.

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.812
No bullshit, I swear to Christ.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:57.814
Roxanne, she kidnaps me,

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:01.275
she makes me join some secret agency
to fight terrorists in London.

01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:03.986
Ha-ha. Real funny, asshole.
You had us worried.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.489
Ronnie's getting married on Sunday.
You gotta be here.

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:10.660
I need a favor. Are you still coordinating
all the cargo flights going out of Newark?

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.746
Right. Nothin' leaves the airport
without me knowin' about it.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.122
What do you need?

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:18.292
You stupid? I need to leave an airport
without anybody knowing.

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.183
- Gary?
- Yeah.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.398
Container 726.
Tell Bobby he owes me, yeah?

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:41.482
I'll do that.

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:55.495
Hey, here.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.822
Does this remind you of something?

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.782
Think about it.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:35.703
Janitor's closet… by the gym.

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:36.913
That's the one.

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:38.831
- Eighth grade.
- Yeah.

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:07.317
Hey.

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:09.110
Foster.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:13.866
I assume you're sitting in your office
having a nice chai latte

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:15.534
and listening in on this,

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:18.329
so I know you
and the whole Central Incompetence Agency

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:21.791
think I'm behind this,
and somehow, Roxanne Hall is involved

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:24.543
and, of course, as usual,
you've got it dead wrong.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:27.964
So now the Union is on ice, and meanwhile,

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:30.925
the real bad guys, dollars to doughnuts,

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:34.929
they're selling your stolen intelligence
right this goddamn minute.

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:37.181
And you know what happens next?

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:42.019
An old flame of mine
runs a CIA office in Istanbul.

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:46.607
She'll be driving her grandkids
to soccer practice

01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:49.402
when the whole car's blown to smithereens

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.571
because some terrorist cell
got her home address

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:56.283
and the... and the make and model
of her car from your stolen intel!

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.495
Every agency, every employee,

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:03.374
from the bigwigs to the regular Joes,
are gonna be droppin' like flies.

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:05.501
You ready for that, Foster?

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:07.628
'Cause this is coming down on your head.

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:11.382
You better pray what's left of my team
can find that intel

01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:12.967
before somebody else does.

01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:18.931
It's not that I think it's small.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.182
Excuse me?

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:23.811
Your life… in Paterson.

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:26.188
You know, what I said in the car?

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:30.026
I don't think that your life
has been small.

01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:31.109
Oh.

01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:37.825
You know, I just needed to get out
and see what else was out there, you know?

01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:39.617
I get that.

01:15:42.329 --> 01:15:44.373
Was it everything you wanted it to be?

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:46.542
Sometimes.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:49.086
Sometimes, no.

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:57.845
You know, I don't… know
if we definitely get out of this.

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:00.848
We might not win this one,

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.351
but I'm glad it's you and me.

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:09.273
And I'm really glad
I walked back into that bar.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:25.956
Oh, welcome to Istria. Oh-ho!

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.542
I read my travel guide on the way.

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:32.838
Everywhere you go,
there's a Bobby Breslin, huh?

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:44.433
- See you're still good at it.
- It's all in the wrist.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:57.446
Well, he always said
he wanted to sail around the world.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.990
Looks like he's gonna get his chance.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:03.285
You two ever go on vacation together?

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:05.162
- Nope.
- Honeymoon?

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:06.246
Uh-uh.

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:11.460
You ever go anywhere nice just to,
I don't know, hang out, go for a swim?

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:12.711
Not shoot somebody?

01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:15.381
Nope. Never.

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:18.300
It's worth thinkin' about.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:31.146
I knew it.

01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:40.322
Looks like they're on the move.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:42.407
Let's go.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:47.830
You okay, Rox? You cool?

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.958
Yeah. I'm cool. Don't I look cool?

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.919
Well, you always look cool, but… Oh shit.

01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:00.968
That was either
the president of Croatia's motorcade...

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:03.721
Or the deal for the intel
is about to go down.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:27.870
Hi.

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.705
Hi. Coca-Cola for me, and…

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:31.331
Ice water.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:32.373
Sparkling.

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:34.668
Sparkling.

01:18:34.752 --> 01:18:35.752
Thank you.

01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:38.255
You brought bodyguards?

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:41.592
Well, not as many as you.

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:46.180
You must treat with caution a man
who is willing to betray his friends.

01:18:46.263 --> 01:18:47.848
The Union weren't my friends.

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:49.516
They were my employers.

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:52.811
And now I'm freelance, so let's do this.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:55.856
I tease. Indeed.
Let's finish this quickly.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:10.162
Once the payment is verified,
we can complete the transaction.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:14.917
Once the intel is verified,
we can complete the payment.

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:18.295
Well, well, well.

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:20.506
What are the odds, huh?

01:19:22.883 --> 01:19:24.551
You made a big mistake, Roxanne.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:28.764
- Who is this?
- This is Nick's former partner.

01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:30.599
Professional and personal.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.394
- Hello, Rox.
- Hello, Juliet.

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:35.437
- Do we have a problem here?
- No.

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:38.274
Oh, we absolutely have a problem here.

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:42.778
Any quarrel you have with Mr. Faraday
has nothing to do with me.

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:44.446
Okay, look here.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.241
If you wanna sit at the big kids' table

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:50.703
and buy stolen secrets
from an ex-secret agent, fine by me,

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.037
but what we're not gonna do

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:55.082
is sit here and pretend
like you don't know what you're doing.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:57.918
So what do you want, Rox?

01:19:58.002 --> 01:20:01.839
I want you to go to prison
for murder, espionage, and treason.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.718
- Roxanne.
- I'm taking you both in right now.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:08.846
- It appears we have a complication.
- I can assure you...

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:11.140
Your assurances are worth very little now.

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:15.144
I'm afraid I must treat this
as the conclusion of our negotiations.

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:20.990
Get off me.
Remove your hand!

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:24.361
Get the intel!

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.074
Get his bag!

01:20:32.202 --> 01:20:35.748
It's a sad day when you can't even trust
an Iranian terror cell, huh?

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:38.792
Like I said, Rox,
you made a big mistake coming here.

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:41.920
Oh, my big mistake was marrying you.
Coming here was just reckless.

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:43.047
I guess it was.

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:45.591
- Kill her.
- Wait.

01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:49.219
Nick, darling.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:54.308
This was fun, but now it feels messy,
and that's just not me.

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:56.643
What are you talkin' about?

01:20:56.727 --> 01:21:00.314
I think maybe the best thing for us
will be to have a little break. Hm?

01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:03.734
- Chance for the dust to settle.
- Juliet.

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:08.697
Roxanne, if you live through this,
I'm sure you'll come after me.

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:10.074
Oh, you can count on it.

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:13.202
Yes. Well, remember
that I spared your life

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:16.413
and consider that I might be
more useful to you out in the field.

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:18.999
I expect we'll meet again.

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:22.544
Nick, I suspect we probably won't.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:27.382
Juliet!

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.804
I just love a girls' girl, don't you?

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:43.023
So that's what we're doing now, Rox?
You're just gonna shoot me in cold blood?

01:21:43.107 --> 01:21:45.526
- Five dead in Trieste?
- They were collateral damage.

01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:48.570
Oh, you're making this
easier and easier for me.

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:50.280
Get up. Let's go.

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:09.925
Son of a bitch.

01:22:18.559 --> 01:22:19.893
After him!

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:38.454
If you come after me, Rox,
I'm gonna have to kill you.

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:40.706
Oh, I don't think that's gonna happen.

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:49.339
I could have taken you out in Trieste,
but I didn't.

01:22:49.423 --> 01:22:52.759
Didn't or couldn't?
Let's find out, shall we?

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.597
- Hey, Rox. Where are you?
- Just regretting my life choices.

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:58.557
What about you?

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.601
Up on the roof. It's getting real crowded.

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:07.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:10.861
Here. Here.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:17.700
Shit.

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:20.204
Rox, I could use a hand.

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:21.580
On my way, Mike.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:25.626
Oh! Oh, I drop that, and it smashes,
you know who gets smashed next, right?

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:27.002
You don't get to go home.

01:23:27.878 --> 01:23:29.796
You having second thoughts, huh?

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.632
Hey! No safety rope?

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:35.010
My foreman would have your ass.
Oh, don't look down.

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:37.638
Here, here, here.
Come and get it. Come on.

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.223
You want it? Come get it.

01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:18.177
Mike!

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:19.846
I got this!

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.600
Jesus! Oh!

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:41.493
Mike!

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:45.664
You're welcome!

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:46.748
You're welcome!

01:24:58.302 --> 01:25:00.304
Try to hold onto this this time, okay?

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:07.603
- I told you I got a couple of guys.
- Let's see if you can get some more.

01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:15.901
That's enough, Rox.

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:18.322
That's enough.

01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:20.907
Now give me the intel or lose her forever.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.201
Take the shot, Mike.

01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:26.330
You do not have the shot, Mikey.

01:25:26.413 --> 01:25:28.373
Go ahead, Mike. Do it.

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:31.042
Don't do it.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.045
Go ahead, Mike.

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.547
Be a good boy. Come on.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:47.434
You had the shot.
You're just too chickenshit to take it.

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:52.229
Mike, run!

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:01.698
Hey. Hey!

01:26:04.034 --> 01:26:05.369
Hey!

01:26:05.452 --> 01:26:06.452
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:17.089
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:19.299
Hi, sir. Hi. Here, let me help you out.

01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:21.426
Come on. There you go.
Thank you very much.

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:24.096
I will take good care of her.
I won't get a scratch on her.

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:02.134
Son of a bitch!

01:27:33.165 --> 01:27:34.541
Shit!

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.679
Mike! Where are you?

01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:48.847
I'm in a car.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:49.765
Where?

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:50.891
I don't know!

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:52.559
What do you mean you don't know?

01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:53.769
I'm in the trunk.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:55.437
In the trunk?

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:08.784
- Give it up, Nicky!
- You know I got the better car!

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:11.661
It's not about the car, baby!

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:13.288
It's about the driver!

01:28:41.107 --> 01:28:42.192
Oh shit!

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.779
What?

01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:47.447
Wait. Oh!

01:28:47.948 --> 01:28:50.033
- That's the trunk you're in!
- Yeah!

01:28:50.116 --> 01:28:51.827
Well, get outta the trunk, Mike!

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:53.411
I'm workin' on it!

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:05.257
Oh shit! Rox!

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:06.174
Wasn't me!

01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:34.661
Mike, get back in the car!

01:29:38.164 --> 01:29:40.125
- What?
- Get back in the car, Mike!

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:04.648
You prick!

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:09.362
Rox, where are ya? Let's go.

01:30:09.446 --> 01:30:11.156
I'm heading north up the coast!

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.616
You still in the game?

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:14.618
Yeah, I'm back in the game, Rox!

01:30:15.452 --> 01:30:16.536
I'm back in the game.

01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:26.963
Here you go, bitch!

01:30:33.887 --> 01:30:35.555
Goddamn it.

01:30:44.064 --> 01:30:46.066
Rox, are you taking a breather? Come on!

01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:47.359
No, smart-ass!

01:30:59.746 --> 01:31:00.746
Shit.

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:23.561
Argh!

01:31:41.663 --> 01:31:42.664
Mike!

01:31:44.082 --> 01:31:45.208
Mike!

01:31:51.047 --> 01:31:52.047
Mike.

01:31:58.763 --> 01:31:59.848
Shit.

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:02.099
Hey.

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:05.103
What... You... You're alive?

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:07.647
Oh my God. Car started swerving.

01:32:08.148 --> 01:32:10.442
I remember my training,
all couple weeks of it.

01:32:10.984 --> 01:32:13.236
I just screamed,
and I just jumped outta the car.

01:32:13.319 --> 01:32:16.072
It was actually pretty cool.
I think you'd have been impressed.

01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:19.743
Why'd you stop?

01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:23.663
'Cause I thought you were dead, asshole!

01:32:24.247 --> 01:32:26.666
Aw! I didn't know you cared!
That is so sweet.

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:28.585
You know what?
You shoulda stayed in the car!

01:32:28.668 --> 01:32:32.047
Hey, I almost died.
You could show a little sympathy.

01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:33.423
A little softer side.

01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:39.637
- You better hold on to something.
- Let's get his ass.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:47.103
- I know where he's goin'.
- Oh, Mr. Big Shot on a big yacht, huh?

01:32:47.187 --> 01:32:51.191
Well, we can't let that happen.
You know what? Bang a right right here.

01:32:51.274 --> 01:32:52.484
Bang a right here.

01:33:29.145 --> 01:33:31.356
- Okay, when I say "jump," jump, okay?
- Okay!

01:33:32.774 --> 01:33:33.983
Jump!

01:33:34.067 --> 01:33:36.027
No! Wait! It's stuck! Oh!

01:33:40.865 --> 01:33:41.908
God… damn!

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:48.832
You threw a car at me?!

01:33:49.415 --> 01:33:51.709
Hands on your head and hit the ground!

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:55.088
Hey, I'm gonna strangle you to death
with my bare hands!

01:33:56.005 --> 01:33:59.342
- Get on the floor now, asshole!
- That's not how this is goin' down.

01:33:59.425 --> 01:34:01.678
Oh, that's exactly
how it's goin' down, Nicky.

01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:03.721
That's not how this is goin' down, Rox!

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:05.473
I can't go in!

01:34:06.599 --> 01:34:07.684
Look at this!

01:34:08.935 --> 01:34:10.186
Look at where we are!

01:34:11.604 --> 01:34:12.730
Ain't it beautiful?

01:34:13.982 --> 01:34:17.527
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life
in a cage, Rox. No way.

01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:19.487
Goddamn it, Nick! Hit the ground!

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:21.072
We could still sell it!

01:34:21.823 --> 01:34:23.950
Hundreds of millions of dollars!

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:26.119
That could be us!

01:34:26.202 --> 01:34:28.246
He's full of shit, Rox, and you know it.

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.873
We could disappear.

01:34:30.456 --> 01:34:33.751
Travel the world like we always…
like we always dreamed about.

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.421
Funny thing I learned about me.

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:37.504
I'm a homebody.

01:34:43.553 --> 01:34:44.929
Rox!

01:35:04.741 --> 01:35:06.576
He didn't give you much choice, Rox.

01:35:08.661 --> 01:35:09.661
Nope.

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:21.381
So what now?

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:29.307
Look, we all know

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:32.101
you can never predict
how two people will fall in love.

01:35:32.185 --> 01:35:35.021
Sometimes they meet in high school,
and they know right away.

01:35:35.104 --> 01:35:38.566
Sometimes they meet at a bar in Jersey…

01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:41.152
…one of them gets drunk
and takes his shirt off…

01:35:42.195 --> 01:35:43.279
It wasn't me.

01:35:44.697 --> 01:35:48.243
And thankfully, somebody else
happens to be the bartender,

01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:50.954
and she has to drive his sorry ass home.

01:35:51.621 --> 01:35:54.499
When I heard they were tying the knot,
I wasn't upset.

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:57.001
We were absolutely relieved.

01:35:57.085 --> 01:36:00.797
Finally, somebody was crazy enough
to take this guy off of our hands.

01:36:02.215 --> 01:36:05.093
No, seriously. I love ya,
and I'm always here for you.

01:36:05.176 --> 01:36:07.762
Congratulations.
Give it up for them, guys!

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:09.681
Mike, cheers!

01:36:11.307 --> 01:36:12.307
God bless you.

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:14.560
Congrats. Congratulations.

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:17.480
Boys, better get ready.

01:36:19.148 --> 01:36:22.652
Ready, brother.
Hey, I'll see you on the floor?

01:36:22.735 --> 01:36:23.569
Yeah.

01:36:23.653 --> 01:36:25.571
- Get ready for me.
- You got it.

01:36:27.073 --> 01:36:28.073
Nice speech.

01:36:29.242 --> 01:36:30.618
Rox.

01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:33.204
I didn't know you crash weddings
in Paterson.

01:36:33.288 --> 01:36:35.164
I told you I was a homebody.

01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:39.252
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

01:36:39.335 --> 01:36:40.920
- So do you.
- Thank you.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.674
So, uh, this is a

01:36:45.717 --> 01:36:46.843
good turnout.

01:36:49.262 --> 01:36:51.723
Wait, is… is that Ms. Hoffman?

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:53.182
- No. No, don't.
- Is that her?

01:36:53.266 --> 01:36:54.266
Please.

01:36:55.018 --> 01:36:56.018
Ms. Hoffman!

01:36:57.061 --> 01:36:58.061
Hi!

01:36:59.439 --> 01:37:00.606
Hey, Nicole.

01:37:01.774 --> 01:37:04.527
- Oh, Nicole. Oh, right, Nicole.
- Yeah, Nicole.

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:06.279
You know, Nicole looks good.

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:09.198
- You had to do that, didn't you?
- I'm sorry, yes.

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:21.586
- Mike, get out here!
- Come on, Mikey!

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:24.630
You know, Rox,
when I was up on that mountain,

01:37:24.714 --> 01:37:26.174
and you thought I was dead…

01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:27.091
Yeah.

01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:30.845
…even though Faraday might have got away,
you came back for me.

01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:32.971
And your point is?

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:35.183
Nothing. I mean, I just…

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:38.853
- I think I saw a few tears there.
- No, you didn't.

01:37:38.936 --> 01:37:40.188
- Okay.
- Sorry.

01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:41.147
Hmm.

01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:43.232
- Well, what about you?
- What?

01:37:43.316 --> 01:37:45.026
When Faraday had the gun to my head,

01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:47.153
you could have taken a shot,
and you didn't.

01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:50.323
It was too risky.

01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:53.117
I gave you permission.

01:37:53.743 --> 01:37:55.995
I don't care.
I would never take that chance.

01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:59.248
I don't wanna mess up your hair.

01:38:02.085 --> 01:38:05.963
You know, I think I saw
a… janitor's closet back there.

01:38:08.383 --> 01:38:09.383
Wanna go?

01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:11.594
Are you serious?

01:38:11.677 --> 01:38:12.678
Yes, I'm serious.

01:38:12.762 --> 01:38:14.055

I got a job for you.
