00:01.370 --> 00:03.210
<b>EPISODE TWO
AND NOW… I'M GOING TO MOVE THE EARTH</b>

00:03.290 --> 00:05.290
<b>If it's the Earth that moves,</b>

00:05.880 --> 00:08.130
<b>reason and beauty become one.</b>

00:10.510 --> 00:14.430
<b>The cosmos is unified
under a single order.</b>

00:15.840 --> 00:19.640
<b>If the theory accepted
by the Church is the geocentric model,</b>

00:21.060 --> 00:23.890
<b>mine is heliocentrism. How about that?</b>

00:26.480 --> 00:29.190
<b>Helio… centrism?</b>

00:29.900 --> 00:32.360
<b>S-Such an idea…</b>

00:34.740 --> 00:35.570
<b>could…</b>

00:36.660 --> 00:37.490
<b>No.</b>

00:39.780 --> 00:41.950
<b>That's just plain wrong.</b>

00:43.910 --> 00:45.710
<b>I'll give you three reasons.</b>

00:48.290 --> 00:51.130
<b>First, there are too many contradictions.</b>

00:51.630 --> 00:54.130
<b>If the Earth is moving…</b>

00:57.340 --> 01:00.760
<b>why do I land in the same spot
when I jump?</b>

01:02.310 --> 01:03.390
<b>Second.</b>

01:03.480 --> 01:05.890
<b>If we accept that the Earth is moving,</b>

01:05.980 --> 01:07.600
<b>who would support that theory?</b>

01:08.310 --> 01:10.690
<b>The Earth is at the center of the universe</b>

01:10.770 --> 01:14.440
<b>because God wanted
humankind's home to be special.</b>

01:15.110 --> 01:17.570
<b>To deny that would be disastrous.</b>

01:19.660 --> 01:20.870
<b>And third.</b>

01:21.370 --> 01:23.750
<b>Risking your life for intuition</b>

01:24.330 --> 01:25.620
<b>is foolish.</b>

01:27.210 --> 01:28.630
<b>A sound argument.</b>

01:29.250 --> 01:31.540
<b>However, I disagree with your third point.</b>

01:33.710 --> 01:36.800
<b>It's because my life is on the line</b>

01:36.880 --> 01:38.340
<b>that I believe my intuition.</b>

01:40.760 --> 01:43.390
<b>And what if you're wrong?</b>

01:44.850 --> 01:45.930
<b>It doesn't matter.</b>

01:46.560 --> 01:48.980
<b>A wrong answer is not a meaningless one.</b>

01:49.980 --> 01:52.820
<b>"A wrong answer is not a meaningless one"?</b>

01:53.570 --> 01:55.150
<b>Are you insane?</b>

01:55.240 --> 01:58.660
<b>I don't find
your heliocentric theory beautiful,</b>

01:58.740 --> 02:01.660
<b>nor will I jump through fire to prove it.</b>

02:03.620 --> 02:05.450
<b>I don't want to come here tomorrow.</b>

02:05.950 --> 02:06.790
<b>Is that so?</b>

02:08.540 --> 02:09.420
<b>Huh?</b>

02:09.500 --> 02:12.170
<b>I'll see you tomorrow then.</b>

02:22.050 --> 02:25.010
<b>The heavens are still,
and the Earth moves?</b>

02:25.520 --> 02:29.770
<b>Not only that,
but it rotates and revolves too?</b>

02:31.520 --> 02:34.150
<b>How could something
that ridiculous be true?</b>

02:36.480 --> 02:37.320
<b>Just look.</b>

02:37.400 --> 02:40.660
<b>Even now, the stars are moving
in small increments.</b>

02:41.910 --> 02:44.120
<b>Watch for an hour, and it's clear.</b>

02:45.290 --> 02:47.450
<b>Even the idea of rotation is impossible.</b>

02:57.170 --> 02:59.090
<b>Man, that hurt!</b>

02:59.170 --> 03:00.880
<b>How clumsy of me.</b>

03:02.140 --> 03:05.100
<b>I thought the mountains
flipped over for a second.</b>

03:09.680 --> 03:11.770
<b>The mountains flipped over?</b>

03:13.650 --> 03:15.940
<b>B-But that's only because</b>

03:16.020 --> 03:17.730
<b>I was moving.</b>

03:17.820 --> 03:20.200
<b>It's not the mountains that moved.</b>

03:22.110 --> 03:23.990
<b>That much is obvious.</b>

03:24.700 --> 03:27.830
<b>But if I extend that obvious logic…</b>

03:31.790 --> 03:35.250
<b>If I'm the Earth,
and the mountains are the Sun…</b>

03:36.540 --> 03:38.340
<b>If the observer moves…</b>

03:40.420 --> 03:42.180
<b>the still object in the distance</b>

03:42.680 --> 03:44.720
<b>will also appear to move.</b>

03:51.020 --> 03:53.690
<b>It may… be rotating.</b>

03:54.190 --> 03:55.770
<b>No, wait!</b>

03:56.730 --> 03:59.190
<b>Even if I accepted the rotation…</b>

04:01.490 --> 04:03.530
<b>there's no way it's revolving.</b>

04:04.030 --> 04:07.200
<b>Let's say Earth moves
for the sake of argument.</b>

04:07.910 --> 04:11.290
<b>I'll apply Ptolemy's model
to the heliocentric theory.</b>

04:11.790 --> 04:14.960
<b>I just need to expand
or shrink the epicyclical radius</b>

04:15.040 --> 04:18.460
<b>of the planets thought to be
beyond the Sun to equal the radius</b>

04:18.540 --> 04:20.710
<b>of the current Sun's revolution.</b>

04:20.800 --> 04:23.010
<b>For planets closer than the Sun,</b>

04:23.090 --> 04:25.720
<b>I'll expand the center
of their epicycles to equal the Sun.</b>

04:25.800 --> 04:29.140
<b>If their induction path
is the same as the current Sun's orbit,</b>

04:29.220 --> 04:33.640
<b>and the Earth followed the same path
as it revolved around the Sun…</b>

04:36.940 --> 04:39.650
<b>This is ridiculous blasphemy.</b>

04:39.730 --> 04:41.360
<b>It's nonsense and plain wrong.</b>

04:42.190 --> 04:44.530
<b>Not only that, I could be arrested.</b>

04:44.610 --> 04:46.320
<b>I have no reason to pursue it.</b>

04:47.620 --> 04:50.580
<b>The individual planets move in sequence,</b>

04:51.200 --> 04:54.080
<b>and the cosmos is unified
under a single order.</b>

04:54.660 --> 04:57.130
<b>Everything moves in a harmonious sequence?</b>

04:57.630 --> 05:01.300
<b>The entire universe moves
under a single order?</b>

05:04.380 --> 05:05.550
<b>It's all lies!</b>

05:05.630 --> 05:08.090
<b>The planets move independently.</b>

05:09.970 --> 05:11.140
<b>That has to be it.</b>

05:11.220 --> 05:12.140
<b>Because if not…</b>

05:14.600 --> 05:16.600
<b>If the vastness of heaven</b>

05:16.690 --> 05:18.270
<b>moved with one mind</b>

05:18.900 --> 05:21.320
<b>in such a rational way…</b>

05:23.400 --> 05:24.990
<b>I can't help but see…</b>

05:27.110 --> 05:29.660
<b>this theory as beautiful!</b>

05:29.740 --> 05:32.160
<b>EARTH</b>

05:32.240 --> 05:35.160
<b>SUN, EARTH</b>

05:36.960 --> 05:39.420
<b>It may… be true.</b>

06:03.230 --> 06:05.740
<b>ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH</b>

07:15.140 --> 07:18.560
<b>Your observations have grown
even more precise lately.</b>

07:19.520 --> 07:20.770
<b>Did something change?</b>

07:26.690 --> 07:27.530
<b>If I may.</b>

07:30.190 --> 07:32.070
<b>Hubert,</b>

07:32.160 --> 07:33.740
<b>why put yourself in danger</b>

07:34.570 --> 07:37.540
<b>and give up your place in heaven
just for this?</b>

07:38.830 --> 07:41.080
<b>Do you want to deny the existence of God?</b>

07:41.580 --> 07:42.670
<b>It's the opposite.</b>

07:43.710 --> 07:45.750
<b>I do it because I believe in God.</b>

07:49.260 --> 07:50.420
<b>Most people believe</b>

07:50.920 --> 07:54.260
<b>this world is an ugly place
filled with greed and corruption,</b>

07:54.340 --> 07:56.890
<b>while the afterlife is pure and beautiful.</b>

07:57.510 --> 07:58.390
<b>But</b>

07:59.100 --> 08:01.270
<b>I can't accept that.</b>

08:02.640 --> 08:04.600
<b>This world created by God</b>

08:05.400 --> 08:07.520
<b>is surely the most beautiful of all.</b>

08:11.110 --> 08:15.240
<b>A person doesn't need
faith, money, or status to know that.</b>

08:16.410 --> 08:18.450
<b>I will show</b>

08:18.530 --> 08:21.080
<b>that even trapped in this tiny skull,</b>

08:21.580 --> 08:24.170
<b>my intellect is all I need
to understand God's works.</b>

08:25.290 --> 08:28.460
<b>That's why I don't read
the holy scripture.</b>

08:28.540 --> 08:29.880
<b>I read nature.</b>

08:32.090 --> 08:34.970
<b>But doesn't a life like that…</b>

08:36.760 --> 08:38.430
<b>frighten you?</b>

08:39.260 --> 08:40.180
<b>It does.</b>

08:42.680 --> 08:43.600
<b>Even so,</b>

08:44.100 --> 08:47.610
<b>a life that isn't frightening
is missing its essence.</b>

08:52.070 --> 08:54.490
<b>Oh, and one more thing.</b>

08:54.570 --> 08:56.780
<b>This is your last day of observation.</b>

08:57.570 --> 08:58.490
<b>What?</b>

09:00.490 --> 09:03.000
<b>I've discovered a way to continue alone.</b>

09:03.620 --> 09:07.540
<b>Then what do I do from tomorrow?</b>

09:09.130 --> 09:11.840
<b>Good question. You're free to choose.</b>

09:12.920 --> 09:14.130
<b>However,</b>

09:14.840 --> 09:15.970
<b>continue astronomy.</b>

09:16.470 --> 09:17.800
<b>For your own sake.</b>

09:21.510 --> 09:23.640
<b>Though that's just a suggestion.</b>

09:25.230 --> 09:27.650
<b>Well, thank you for everything.</b>

09:36.400 --> 09:37.410
<b>It's over.</b>

09:37.910 --> 09:38.910
<b>Just like that.</b>

09:39.740 --> 09:41.330
<b>What was this all about?</b>

09:41.830 --> 09:43.490
<b>"Continue astronomy," he says?</b>

09:43.580 --> 09:45.290
<b>I can't do that.</b>

09:50.040 --> 09:52.460
<b>Potocki? Why is he in front of the house?</b>

09:54.010 --> 09:55.090
<b>Hi!</b>

09:56.670 --> 09:57.680
<b>Huh?</b>

09:59.180 --> 10:00.340
<b>Hello there.</b>

10:05.220 --> 10:07.020
<b>Are you Rafal?</b>

10:07.520 --> 10:09.940
<b>I'm the Inquisitor, Nowak.</b>

10:10.860 --> 10:14.360
<b>I'm here to inquire about Hubert's actions
since his recantation.</b>

10:15.360 --> 10:16.820
<b>I-Is that so?</b>

10:17.320 --> 10:21.160
<b>Hubert has fully reformed,
and he's been living modestly.</b>

10:21.820 --> 10:23.660
<b>Oh? I'm glad to hear that.</b>

10:24.370 --> 10:29.120
<b>After all, a man charged
as a heretic twice will be put to death.</b>

10:29.620 --> 10:32.340
<b>His collaborators
would face serious charges too.</b>

10:32.420 --> 10:35.420
<b>All that extra work
is no fun for me either.</b>

10:35.920 --> 10:37.840
<b>Th-That sounds rough.</b>

10:37.920 --> 10:40.260
<b>I can't tolerate those foolish heretics.</b>

10:40.340 --> 10:42.220
<b>Glad to have your support.</b>

10:44.260 --> 10:45.350
<b>So tell me then…</b>

10:48.180 --> 10:49.310
<b>What's this?</b>

10:51.690 --> 10:53.860
<b>I found it in your bookcase.</b>

10:54.480 --> 10:56.820
<b>I haven't told Potocki yet,</b>

10:57.400 --> 11:01.740
<b>but it sure seems to contain
detailed notes about blasphemous research.</b>

11:02.780 --> 11:03.820
<b>What is this?</b>

11:03.910 --> 11:05.910
<b>It's… uh…</b>

11:07.290 --> 11:09.080
<b>What could it be?</b>

11:11.460 --> 11:13.080
<b>That belongs to me.</b>

11:14.880 --> 11:16.590
<b>H-Hubert?!</b>

11:17.090 --> 11:21.090
<b>I thought it would be harder to find
if I hid it in that child's room,</b>

11:22.050 --> 11:24.260
<b>but it seems I've been caught.</b>

11:24.850 --> 11:28.020
<b>Oh? So that's the case, is it?</b>

11:28.720 --> 11:32.270
<b>But you'd better think carefully, Hubert.</b>

11:32.350 --> 11:33.560
<b>Do you realize</b>

11:33.650 --> 11:37.110
<b>where such a statement will lead you?</b>

11:40.320 --> 11:43.360
<b>I came back to finish what I started.</b>

11:45.490 --> 11:47.410
<b>Be honest, please.</b>

11:47.490 --> 11:50.750
<b>Does this really belong to you?</b>

11:51.910 --> 11:54.040
<b>Of course it does.</b>

11:54.750 --> 11:57.710
<b>In fact, you're the one
who should think carefully.</b>

11:58.380 --> 12:02.260
<b>Do you really think a child
could assist with my research?</b>

12:04.140 --> 12:06.800
<b>Well, I suppose that's true.</b>

12:06.890 --> 12:08.890
<b>Sorry about that, Rafal.</b>

12:11.180 --> 12:14.060
<b>-In that case, put Hubert under arrest.
-Huh?</b>

12:14.730 --> 12:17.060
<b>Wait!</b>

12:17.150 --> 12:18.690
<b>So suddenly?!</b>

12:19.730 --> 12:20.990
<b>Oh, that's right.</b>

12:22.860 --> 12:25.110
<b>I came to give you this.</b>

12:30.240 --> 12:31.660
<b>-Farewell.
-Huh?</b>

12:33.040 --> 12:34.000
<b>Hubert!</b>

12:35.120 --> 12:37.710
<b>Will you really just go?</b>

12:38.210 --> 12:40.130
<b>Weren't you going to finish something?</b>

12:43.970 --> 12:45.380
<b>I just did.</b>

12:52.980 --> 12:54.730
<b>And so, Hubert</b>

12:55.230 --> 12:56.520
<b>was burned to death.</b>

13:00.020 --> 13:02.070
<b>ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH</b>

13:02.150 --> 13:02.990
<b>-Orb.
-Orb.</b>

13:11.910 --> 13:12.830
<b>He died.</b>

13:13.330 --> 13:14.750
<b>To save me.</b>

13:16.170 --> 13:17.960
<b>I know he was a heretic,</b>

13:18.630 --> 13:21.130
<b>but what was the right thing for me to do?</b>

13:22.380 --> 13:24.130
<b>His unfinished work…</b>

13:25.550 --> 13:27.050
<b>Three stars.</b>

13:28.640 --> 13:30.220
<b>Orion's Belt?</b>

13:31.140 --> 13:34.020
<b>Why is only Alnilam
in the center painted black?</b>

13:36.230 --> 13:37.230
<b>I'm fond of the way</b>

13:37.730 --> 13:42.980
<b>those mountains
and rocks resemble Orion's Belt.</b>

13:43.940 --> 13:44.780
<b>Wait!</b>

14:05.800 --> 14:09.130
<b>I've come to the mountain

14:09.220 --> 14:10.640
<b>but I don't see--</b>

14:28.490 --> 14:29.910
<b>This is</b>

14:30.780 --> 14:31.740
<b>a letter?</b>

14:33.580 --> 14:36.410
<b>"To the person who finds this letter."</b>

14:37.250 --> 14:39.870
<b>Please forgive the curt opening,</b>

14:40.370 --> 14:42.750
<b>but I have no idea who you are.</b>

14:43.250 --> 14:46.920
<b>However, I have decided

<b>to the one I deem most trustworthy.</b>

14:50.890 --> 14:52.680
<b>Now to the main order of business.</b>

14:53.260 --> 14:56.520
<b>The documents you see here

<b>into heliocentrism.</b>

14:59.810 --> 15:02.440
<b>I now place all my trust in you</b>

<b>and beg you to finish what I started.</b>

15:06.860 --> 15:07.940
<b>Please,</b>

15:08.030 --> 15:10.150
<b>burn everything.</b>

15:11.990 --> 15:16.040
<b>I am confident that I have spent more time

15:16.540 --> 15:17.790
<b>Because of that,</b>

15:17.870 --> 15:20.330
<b>there is something I alone know.</b>

15:20.410 --> 15:22.000
<b>SUN, EARTH</b>

15:22.080 --> 15:24.380
<b>Heliocentrism can likely never be proven.</b>

15:25.920 --> 15:28.130
<b>There are too many uncertain factors.</b>

15:29.170 --> 15:30.220
<b>It surely must be</b>

15:30.300 --> 15:32.720
<b>the realm of God himself.</b>

15:33.390 --> 15:34.890
<b>If that is the case,</b>

15:34.970 --> 15:37.560
<b>such an imperfect theory should disappear.</b>

15:39.480 --> 15:41.640
<b>Despite that, I don't have the will</b>

15:41.730 --> 15:43.480
<b>or the courage to burn it myself.</b>

15:43.980 --> 15:45.650
<b>Instead, it is my selfish hope</b>

<b>that someone superior to me

15:51.740 --> 15:52.910
<b>That is you.</b>

15:54.450 --> 15:56.160
<b>You are capable of burning it.</b>

15:56.870 --> 16:01.000
<b>Your powers of reason
are far stronger than my intuition.</b>

16:01.660 --> 16:03.120
<b>You can do it.</b>

16:04.210 --> 16:06.500
<b>A reward for the task
can be found in the box.</b>

16:07.000 --> 16:08.710
<b>The amount should be sufficient.</b>

16:11.050 --> 16:13.010
<b>And so, I leave it to you.</b>

16:16.970 --> 16:19.010
<b>Well, it is what it is.</b>

16:20.060 --> 16:23.020
<b>I understand why he chose
to leave this letter too.</b>

16:24.230 --> 16:26.730
<b>Heliocentrism is indeed an amazing idea.</b>

16:27.560 --> 16:30.610
<b>But it's too dangerous,
too out of step with the times,</b>

16:31.690 --> 16:33.950
<b>and more than anything else,
too uncertain.</b>

16:34.990 --> 16:37.370
<b>This is the most reasonable outcome.</b>

16:38.370 --> 16:39.950
<b>The materials must be burned.</b>

16:41.540 --> 16:43.210
<b>It's just as Hubert said.</b>

16:45.080 --> 16:46.630
<b>My powers of reason</b>

16:46.710 --> 16:48.250
<b>set the documents aflame.</b>

16:57.850 --> 16:58.680
<b>But…</b>

17:04.520 --> 17:05.770
<b>Ow!</b>

17:07.560 --> 17:09.360
<b>More than that reasoning,</b>

17:09.940 --> 17:13.110
<b>my intuition wants to believe
in heliocentrism!</b>

17:17.410 --> 17:19.030
<b>Everyone, listen up!</b>

17:19.120 --> 17:23.870
<b>While we're sorry to see him go,
today is the day Rafal leaves our school!</b>

17:23.950 --> 17:24.790
<b>However,</b>

17:25.750 --> 17:27.670
<b>he'll be attending university.</b>

17:28.330 --> 17:29.460
<b>And everyone,</b>

17:29.540 --> 17:32.130
<b>what is the most appropriate field
for him to study?</b>

17:32.760 --> 17:34.090
<b>Do you remember?</b>

17:34.670 --> 17:36.510
<b>-Theology!
-Theology!</b>

17:36.590 --> 17:37.680
<b>That's right.</b>

17:38.180 --> 17:41.390
<b>Rafal, do you have any parting words?</b>

17:41.470 --> 17:42.310
<b>Yes.</b>

17:45.930 --> 17:48.100
<b>Thank you for all you've done for me.</b>

17:48.600 --> 17:50.480
<b>We won't see each other anymore,</b>

17:50.560 --> 17:53.730
<b>but I pray that you receive
God's blessings.</b>

17:55.070 --> 17:56.280
<b>Oh, and one more thing.</b>

17:58.950 --> 18:01.240
<b>I'm going to study astronomy.</b>

18:05.290 --> 18:08.710
<b>Though it pains me to say it,
the world is full of fools.</b>

18:09.790 --> 18:13.550
<b>And before I knew it,
I was at the head of the line.</b>

18:17.050 --> 18:18.220
<b>The real me</b>

18:18.720 --> 18:22.470
<b>is neither dignified,
nor wise, humble, or capable.</b>

18:22.550 --> 18:25.100
<b>What I am is arrogant, brazen,</b>

18:25.180 --> 18:26.980
<b>rash, and helpless.</b>

18:27.770 --> 18:30.940
<b>And now… I'm going to move the Earth.</b>

18:39.490 --> 18:41.620
<b>If you need help, just ask an adult.</b>

18:43.660 --> 18:45.490
<b>See? Just like that.</b>

18:49.250 --> 18:50.370
<b>Here you go.</b>

18:50.460 --> 18:51.880
<b>Thank you very much!</b>

18:51.960 --> 18:55.170
<b>I can't just ignore a crying child.</b>

18:55.670 --> 18:57.380
<b>Be good to your family, okay?</b>

18:58.550 --> 18:59.380
<b>Yes, sir!</b>

19:00.510 --> 19:02.300
<b>Nowak, we'd better get moving.</b>

19:02.890 --> 19:05.010
<b>Huh? Oh, right.</b>

19:08.890 --> 19:12.150
<b>I hope you'll forgive the sudden visit.</b>

19:14.980 --> 19:17.030
<b>What do you intend to do?</b>

19:17.820 --> 19:19.190
<b>I have a child!</b>

19:20.150 --> 19:24.030
<b>Oh, is that so? I have a daughter myself.</b>

19:24.120 --> 19:28.290
<b>She just turned four,
and she's quite cute.</b>

19:30.620 --> 19:33.130
<b>Look, this is a letter from my daughter.</b>

19:33.210 --> 19:35.670
<b>I always carry it with me.</b>

19:37.750 --> 19:40.550
<b>Whenever I think of her,
I get the same feelings.</b>

19:41.260 --> 19:44.140
<b>Comfort, strength, and…</b>

19:45.760 --> 19:47.010
<b>worry.</b>

19:48.270 --> 19:51.480
<b>Love for my child
has become my reason to live.</b>

19:52.230 --> 19:54.940
<b>I don't ever want her to suffer.</b>

19:55.980 --> 20:00.570
<b>So any research that will disrupt
the peace can't be overlooked.</b>

20:02.240 --> 20:07.200
<b>To tell the truth, I don't have
any lofty ideals like protecting humanity.</b>

20:07.700 --> 20:10.500
<b>But when it comes to protecting
the lives and faith</b>

20:10.580 --> 20:13.830
<b>of my family and friends,</b>

20:14.830 --> 20:16.420
<b>there's nothing I won't do.</b>

20:19.460 --> 20:21.220
<b>I'm home!</b>

20:23.970 --> 20:25.260
<b>Oh, my.</b>

20:25.340 --> 20:27.800
<b>So this was your family.</b>

20:36.690 --> 20:39.570
<b>Okay, this is where the wicked gather.</b>

20:39.650 --> 20:41.150
<b>I'll leave the rest to you.</b>

20:41.650 --> 20:43.820
<b>I have dinner with my family to get to.</b>

20:43.900 --> 20:44.910
<b>Huh?</b>

20:44.990 --> 20:47.370
<b>Aren't inquisitors celibate too?</b>

20:47.450 --> 20:49.120
<b>You didn't know?</b>

20:49.200 --> 20:51.950
<b>Nowak never joined the clergy.
He's a layperson.</b>

20:52.450 --> 20:53.660
<b>I don't know the details,</b>

20:53.750 --> 20:57.630
<b>but the Bishop thinks highly of him
and made an exception.</b>

20:57.710 --> 20:59.380
<b>He was once a mercenary.</b>

20:59.460 --> 21:01.090
<b>A mercenary?</b>

21:01.170 --> 21:03.840
<b>How could such bloody hands
do the Lord's work?</b>

21:04.340 --> 21:05.590
<b>It's unthinkable.</b>

21:06.550 --> 21:08.430
<b>How could this be?</b>

21:09.430 --> 21:11.270
<b>Don't get so disheartened.</b>

21:11.770 --> 21:14.060
<b>I'm sure the Bishop has his reasons.</b>

21:15.940 --> 21:17.350
<b>You must</b>

21:18.020 --> 21:19.270
<b>be joking.</b>

21:20.940 --> 21:22.610
<b>You're joking, right?</b>

21:25.070 --> 21:26.070
<b>Huh?</b>

21:28.160 --> 21:32.740
<b>Not only are you abandoning theology,
but it's to study astronomy?</b>

21:34.410 --> 21:37.540
<b>Has Hubert being arrested as a heretic</b>

21:37.620 --> 21:39.750
<b>momentarily robbed you of your senses?</b>

21:42.380 --> 21:44.630
<b>If you don't retract that statement,</b>

21:44.720 --> 21:48.010
<b>I won't sign
this university admission form!</b>

21:52.180 --> 21:53.680
<b>Recently,</b>

21:54.390 --> 21:57.770
<b>after my sudden change in direction,</b>

21:57.850 --> 22:01.060
<b>my future has grown quite precarious.</b>

22:02.820 --> 22:04.650
<b>Being honest,</b>

22:04.740 --> 22:06.360
<b>skillfully explaining myself,</b>

22:06.450 --> 22:09.200
<b>and settling all concerns
would be a Herculean task.</b>

22:12.620 --> 22:14.240
<b>Now, declare it!</b>

22:15.000 --> 22:16.910
<b>You won't study astronomy!</b>

22:18.250 --> 22:19.290
<b>And so…</b>

22:20.580 --> 22:22.790
<b>Understood. I declare it.</b>

22:23.590 --> 22:25.550
<b>I'll never study astronomy again.</b>

22:26.510 --> 22:28.130
<b>…I simply lied.</b>

22:28.760 --> 22:33.220
<b>Oh, my son!
You've returned to your normal self?</b>

22:33.310 --> 22:35.520
<b>Yes! I was being a fool!</b>

22:36.020 --> 22:37.680
<b>I'm so happy!</b>

22:38.520 --> 22:40.480
<b>One can express anything in words.</b>

22:40.980 --> 22:42.770
<b>That's why lying is so convenient.</b>

22:44.360 --> 22:47.070
<b>The rational judgment I've developed</b>

22:47.570 --> 22:49.570
<b>can help me avoid trouble.</b>

22:53.910 --> 22:55.700
<b>Right. That's the way.</b>

22:56.660 --> 22:58.540
<b>Even if I enroll in theology,</b>

22:58.620 --> 23:00.620
<b>I can transfer to astronomy later.</b>

23:01.420 --> 23:04.840
<b>Not going to university
would defeat the purpose.</b>

23:06.300 --> 23:08.420
<b>Proving heliocentrism</b>

23:08.920 --> 23:11.050
<b>could take 30 or 40 years.</b>

23:11.930 --> 23:14.260
<b>But even then, it's no pipe dream.</b>

23:14.760 --> 23:17.720
<b>I just need to proceed little by little.</b>

23:19.310 --> 23:20.770
<b>Still,</b>

23:20.850 --> 23:23.980
<b>if my father hates astronomy so much,</b>

23:25.440 --> 23:29.190
<b>why are there so many
books on it inside this house?</b>
