00:00.470 --> 00:03.730
<b>A few days ago</b>

00:05.440 --> 00:08.980
<b>I am here! Like I am every day!</b>

00:08.980 --> 00:11.690
<b>Detective Tsukauchi... 
and the principal, too?</b>

00:12.110 --> 00:14.360
<b>Are you here about Aoyama?</b>

00:16.100 --> 00:18.060
<b>And what comes after.</b>

00:18.060 --> 00:21.860
<b>Right now, we are only telling 
a select number of people.</b>

02:00.940 --> 02:02.900
<b>First, there is the fact that currently,</b>

02:03.240 --> 02:07.860
<b>the pro heroes are searching 
high and low for All For One,</b>

02:07.860 --> 02:10.990
<b>but their chances of finding 
him seem very low.</b>

02:11.750 --> 02:14.320
<b>Bakugo said something like that, too...</b>

02:14.320 --> 02:17.100
<b>But to hear it all laid out like that...</b>

02:17.100 --> 02:18.690
<b>Does it mean there's no point?</b>

02:18.950 --> 02:22.320
<b>No, it's the opposite. It'll tie 
together with Eraser's plan.</b>

02:22.700 --> 02:25.650
<b>As Class A's homeroom 
teacher, I have an idea.</b>

02:26.250 --> 02:28.460
<b>With Mr. Aizawa's plan...</b>

02:28.750 --> 02:32.170
<b>In order to draw out a cunning coward,</b>

02:32.170 --> 02:35.410
<b>you have to slowly soften his heart.</b>

02:35.720 --> 02:38.840
<b>So pretend like "We've searched 
desperately but still can't find him.</b>

02:38.840 --> 02:40.940
<b>What the hell, scum?"</b>

02:40.940 --> 02:42.580
<b>That's an interesting way to put it.</b>

02:43.150 --> 02:46.050
<b>We'll proceed on the assumption 
that Search is working.</b>

02:46.050 --> 02:50.680
<b>All For One should be minutely 
aware of all our movements.</b>

02:51.190 --> 02:53.970
<b>We'll show him that our efforts 
since Midoriya's return</b>

02:53.970 --> 02:56.180
<b>are resulting in frustration 
and exhaustion.</b>

02:56.640 --> 02:59.500
<b>We'll make him think we're making 
one bad move after another</b>

02:59.500 --> 03:02.400
<b>and make him feel good thinking everything 
is going according to his plan.</b>

03:02.750 --> 03:06.830
<b>We'll use Eraser's plan to 
use the informant, Aoyama,</b>

03:06.830 --> 03:09.790
<b>to lure All For One somewhere.</b>

03:09.790 --> 03:11.930
<b>We're trying to increase that 
plan's chances of success.</b>

03:12.790 --> 03:14.420
<b>Then, Aoyama is--</b>

03:19.480 --> 03:21.350
<b>I'm so glad!</b>

03:22.840 --> 03:25.250
<b>Aoyama...!</b>

03:25.250 --> 03:29.270
<b>Excuse me, but what about 
what Aoyama's father said?</b>

03:29.880 --> 03:31.920
<b>If we failed, we would be killed.</b>

03:31.920 --> 03:34.270
<b>If we lied, we would be killed.</b>

03:34.840 --> 03:36.910
<b>That's what he said.</b>

03:36.910 --> 03:40.060
<b>If we don't know how he 
can tell what is a lie,</b>

03:40.060 --> 03:43.740
<b>then isn't there still some danger 
to Aoyama and his family?</b>

03:44.080 --> 03:45.730
<b>We have a plan for that, too.</b>

03:46.350 --> 03:48.220
<b>According to Mr. and Mrs. Aoyama,</b>

03:48.220 --> 03:51.630
<b>All For One only contacts 
them through a voice call.</b>

03:51.630 --> 03:53.400
<b>They have no written contact.</b>

03:53.890 --> 03:55.760
<b>He likely has many other such "friends,"</b>

03:55.760 --> 03:59.590
<b>so I don't think he scrutinizes everything 
they say carefully before acting.</b>

04:00.070 --> 04:04.380
<b>His system can probably tell immediately 
by their voices if someone is lying.</b>

04:04.650 --> 04:08.130
<b>Therefore, if there is 
no lie in that audio,</b>

04:08.130 --> 04:10.400
<b>then he can show up without fear.</b>

04:10.400 --> 04:12.780
<b>That's why we'll use Aizawa's idea,</b>

04:12.780 --> 04:14.300
<b>and use HIM!</b>

04:15.520 --> 04:16.730
<b>C'mon!</b>

04:20.780 --> 04:21.700
<b>Hey.</b>

04:21.700 --> 04:23.530
<b>Shinso!</b>

04:23.930 --> 04:25.820
<b>Your costume's so cool!</b>

04:26.260 --> 04:30.560
<b>I was surprised when I heard the 
details of the plan from Mr. Aizawa.</b>

04:30.560 --> 04:32.820
<b>Because during the combat battles...</b>

04:33.450 --> 04:37.190
<b>However, I cannot make the 
person I brainwash talk.</b>

04:37.190 --> 04:40.920
<b>Also, orders that require 
them to think won't work.</b>

04:41.280 --> 04:43.630
<b>I thought that was what you said.</b>

04:44.220 --> 04:45.780
<b>Look at this mess.</b>

04:46.410 --> 04:49.160
<b>I thought I'd be transferring 
to the hero course in April</b>

04:49.160 --> 04:51.470
<b>and competing with you all.</b>

04:52.000 --> 04:55.640
<b>I kept training to improve my 
Quirk so I could do that,</b>

04:55.640 --> 04:58.430
<b>but I didn't think we wouldn't be 
able to move on to the next grade.</b>

04:58.430 --> 05:02.220
<b>Improve your Quirk? So you really can...?</b>

05:02.700 --> 05:04.820
<b>Yeah, I can do it.</b>

05:05.410 --> 05:08.410
<b>If I control Aoyama and his 
parents and make them talk,</b>

05:09.120 --> 05:12.990
<b>then neither my will nor their 
feelings will get in the way.</b>

05:12.990 --> 05:15.470
<b>Wow!</b>

05:15.470 --> 05:18.990
<b>But in order to do that, 
it's harder to activate.</b>

05:18.990 --> 05:20.140
<b>You're amazing!</b>

05:20.140 --> 05:22.010
<b>Thanks, Shinso!</b>

05:22.010 --> 05:24.430
<b>Will you be in Class A? Class B?</b>

05:24.430 --> 05:25.460
<b>Join Class A! A!</b>

05:25.460 --> 05:26.600
<b>What's your hero name?</b>

05:26.980 --> 05:28.330
<b>They're so cheerful...</b>

05:28.330 --> 05:30.100
<b>What's with these guys?</b>

05:30.370 --> 05:35.390
<b>Shinso was able to train his 
Quirk thanks to Aizawa's help.</b>

05:35.700 --> 05:38.300
<b>Mr. Aizawa really is amazing!</b>

05:38.710 --> 05:42.440
<b>By the way, Shinso doesn't have 
his provisional license yet,</b>

05:42.440 --> 05:44.090
<b>but since it's an emergency,</b>

05:44.090 --> 05:47.810
<b>we got special permission from 
the acting chairman, Mera.</b>

05:47.810 --> 05:49.060
<b>Whoa!</b>

05:49.530 --> 05:52.530
<b>But isn't the problem what comes next?</b>

05:52.530 --> 05:55.690
<b>We're supposed to lure out the villains 
and round them all up at once?</b>

05:55.690 --> 05:56.630
<b>Is that possible?</b>

05:57.090 --> 05:58.380
<b>Even if there are less heroes now,</b>

05:58.730 --> 06:01.380
<b>if a large number of us 
gather in one place,</b>

06:01.380 --> 06:03.050
<b>then won't that give us away?</b>

06:03.600 --> 06:06.520
<b>It'll be fine if they aren't there.</b>

06:06.520 --> 06:10.390
<b>In order to make that work, there's 
another key person we need.</b>

06:14.920 --> 06:17.280
<b>This is a request from All 
Might and the others.</b>

06:17.670 --> 06:19.890
<b>This is a crucial job.</b>

06:21.000 --> 06:22.090
<b>Can you do it...</b>

06:22.590 --> 06:23.930
<b>Phantom Thief?</b>

06:27.320 --> 06:32.260
<b>"You have a few days to Copy this 
person's Quirk and learn to use it."</b>

06:32.690 --> 06:34.160
<b>Are you kidding?</b>

06:34.870 --> 06:36.290
<b>Sorry.</b>

06:37.060 --> 06:39.350
<b>My voice didn't reach him.</b>

06:40.060 --> 06:42.710
<b>Tell me! Who altered you?!</b>

06:43.660 --> 06:48.450
<b>I am Kurogiri, the protector 
of Tomura Shigaraki.</b>

06:48.960 --> 06:52.420
<b>You were in Class 2-A at U.A. High School!</b>

06:52.420 --> 06:54.930
<b>We were all going to become heroes!</b>

06:54.930 --> 06:57.000
<b>You're Oboro Shirakumo!</b>

06:58.460 --> 07:03.610
<b>Besides, we still don't know if this 
guy is Kurogiri or Shirakumo.</b>

07:04.220 --> 07:08.330
<b>I've lost one eye, and my 
Erasure is barely working.</b>

07:08.850 --> 07:10.440
<b>In the next battle,</b>

07:10.440 --> 07:12.380
<b>I won't be able to do anything.</b>

07:17.530 --> 07:18.700
<b>I heard that at Jaku,</b>

07:19.510 --> 07:22.920
<b>without Eraser Head, we 
would've been wiped out.</b>

07:25.040 --> 07:27.120
<b>I was always told as a kid</b>

07:27.840 --> 07:31.130
<b>that I couldn't be a 
superhero with my Quirk.</b>

07:32.320 --> 07:35.260
<b>That it was a Quirk for a side character...</b>

07:43.170 --> 07:44.330
<b>Monoma.</b>

07:45.340 --> 07:48.440
<b>This plan won't work if 
we're missing anyone.</b>

07:48.790 --> 07:51.640
<b>I can bring him out. Just tell me when.</b>

07:58.760 --> 08:00.600
<b>There are no side characters here.</b>

08:02.990 --> 08:04.500
<b>Up until now...</b>

08:04.500 --> 08:05.840
<b>And from now on...</b>

08:07.240 --> 08:08.660
<b>You're the star!</b>

08:13.370 --> 08:16.170
<b>I'm pulling the strings!</b>

08:16.470 --> 08:20.470
<b>Division</b>

08:21.150 --> 08:24.510
<b>As expected, he brought 
a large army with him.</b>

08:24.870 --> 08:26.260
<b>All squads, move!</b>

08:26.550 --> 08:30.620
<b>If he gets One For All, then there's no 
need for him to run and hide anymore!</b>

08:32.120 --> 08:33.490
<b>We'll end it here...</b>

08:35.100 --> 08:37.480
<b>and this is where we're planning to start!</b>

08:49.040 --> 08:49.710
<b>Dabi.</b>

08:49.710 --> 08:52.100
<b>Don't tell me what to do, Leader!</b>

08:52.370 --> 08:54.760
<b>I didn't think I'd get to see you here,</b>

08:54.760 --> 08:56.630
<b>Dad!</b>

08:56.630 --> 08:59.370
<b>But first, a funeral for your friends?</b>

09:09.330 --> 09:11.190
<b>I won't let you,</b>

09:11.590 --> 09:13.190
<b>idiot brother!</b>

09:13.190 --> 09:15.360
<b>Shoto!</b>

09:16.440 --> 09:18.590
<b>You're gathering in droves...</b>

09:19.270 --> 09:22.820
<b>Are you planning a free-for-all here?</b>

09:23.250 --> 09:24.950
<b>Activate Operation Troy!</b>

09:33.250 --> 09:34.290
<b>Cages?</b>

09:35.880 --> 09:37.970
<b>You think these'll hold us?</b>

09:38.660 --> 09:43.240
<b>They should know that these will 
be torn apart in a second.</b>

09:43.770 --> 09:46.740
<b>So why did they use it 
at such a large scale?</b>

09:46.740 --> 09:49.860
<b>It'll work this time, All Might.</b>

09:49.860 --> 09:50.720
<b></b>

09:50.980 --> 09:54.630
<b>It's a plan we all refined together.</b>

09:54.630 --> 09:56.360
<b>I'm sure it'll go well.</b>

09:57.090 --> 09:59.580
<b>We weren't able to bring him down before.</b>

09:59.960 --> 10:01.850
<b>Your stomach was gouged out.</b>

10:02.600 --> 10:05.230
<b>But you and I are both still alive!</b>

10:05.230 --> 10:07.730
<b>We can do it this time, All Might!</b>

10:08.230 --> 10:09.130
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:09.790 --> 10:12.040
<b>I see, All Might.</b>

10:12.660 --> 10:14.390
<b>I know what you're after.</b>

10:14.700 --> 10:18.200
<b>Away from U.A., away from 
the makeshift fortress.</b>

10:18.200 --> 10:20.100
<b>We needed to do all this!</b>

10:21.180 --> 10:22.420
<b>To make you overconfident</b>

10:22.810 --> 10:24.510
<b>and draw you out.</b>

10:24.510 --> 10:25.950
<b>And then--</b>

10:25.950 --> 10:27.610
<b>I'm pulling the strings!</b>

10:33.400 --> 10:34.780
<b>Now, everyone!</b>

10:35.860 --> 10:38.320
<b>Get in there!</b>

10:38.800 --> 10:43.640
<b>You're trying to split us up!</b>

10:49.670 --> 10:52.040
<b>Neito Monoma</b>

10:55.510 --> 10:57.520
<b>The cage is moving?</b>

10:57.520 --> 11:00.190
<b>You think these things will hold us?!</b>

11:00.600 --> 11:01.700
<b>Break them.</b>

11:04.390 --> 11:05.670
<b>Hurry.</b>

11:08.880 --> 11:10.430
<b>Cages like this...</b>

11:10.430 --> 11:12.700
<b>...won't last three seconds!</b>

11:14.730 --> 11:16.400
<b>Those three seconds...</b>

11:16.710 --> 11:18.470
<b>...were what we wanted!</b>

11:18.970 --> 11:20.900
<b>We just need three seconds.</b>

11:22.290 --> 11:24.310
<b>Limit their movements...</b>

11:26.150 --> 11:27.880
<b>and split them up.</b>

11:31.020 --> 11:32.910
<b>We'll get the first move by seconds!</b>

11:33.620 --> 11:34.450
<b>Deku!</b>

11:34.450 --> 11:35.230
<b>Right!</b>

11:36.460 --> 11:40.840
<b>It's all to make you go through 
the warp gates at the same time</b>

11:40.840 --> 11:43.380
<b>and make sure to split you up!</b>

11:45.780 --> 11:47.880
<b>I'm pulling the strings!</b>

11:48.250 --> 11:49.620
<b>This is stupid!</b>

11:49.620 --> 11:53.230
<b>How much money did you waste just 
to do this, you money worshippers?!</b>

11:53.230 --> 11:58.030
<b>Well, we have a countermeasure 
against Shigaraki's Decay, too!</b>

11:58.030 --> 12:00.560
<b>You just keep brazenly showing up,</b>

12:00.560 --> 12:03.000
<b>but we'll send you scattering!</b>

12:17.540 --> 12:19.920
<b>What... the...?</b>

12:20.740 --> 12:22.140
<b>We can do this!</b>

12:22.490 --> 12:25.040
<b>Get 'em!</b>

12:26.240 --> 12:27.270
<b>Huh?</b>

12:29.170 --> 12:30.020
<b>De--</b>

12:38.660 --> 12:39.640
<b>Fat!</b>

12:39.640 --> 12:42.270
<b>Get the ones who're left! Take command!</b>

12:42.270 --> 12:44.190
<b>I'm leaving Young Aoyama to you!</b>

12:44.660 --> 12:45.540
<b>Roger!</b>

12:48.270 --> 12:50.040
<b>"We will defeat you here!"</b>

12:50.040 --> 12:51.730
<b>That was a good bluff!</b>

12:51.730 --> 12:54.120
<b>M-M-M-Merci!</b>

12:54.120 --> 12:56.830
<b>Young Monoma, return to Aizawa!</b>

12:56.830 --> 12:57.750
<b>Yup.</b>

12:59.140 --> 13:00.810
<b>We've successfully split them up!</b>

13:01.270 --> 13:05.140
<b>We will now move on to Phase 2!</b>

13:09.350 --> 13:12.850
<b>Gunga Villa Site</b>

13:16.850 --> 13:18.370
<b>This is...</b>

13:19.060 --> 13:20.360
<b>Welcome!</b>

13:25.670 --> 13:27.620
<b>Gunga Villa...</b>

13:28.690 --> 13:30.070
<b>I see.</b>

13:30.360 --> 13:32.160
<b>Sorry, Endeavor.</b>

13:32.160 --> 13:36.380
<b>I guess he's not going to come wearing 
stuff that I can cut through.</b>

13:36.380 --> 13:38.620
<b>Don't worry. I wasn't expecting you to.</b>

13:39.880 --> 13:42.080
<b>We figured out that the sludgy Warp you have</b>

13:42.080 --> 13:44.170
<b>is a lesser version of Kurogiri's</b>

13:44.170 --> 13:46.380
<b>at the battle in Camino.</b>

13:47.020 --> 13:49.540
<b>The warping distance is much shorter,</b>

13:49.540 --> 13:51.480
<b>and you can't warp yourself.</b>

13:51.940 --> 13:55.420
<b>The U.A. Barrier was also strengthened 
to account for that.</b>

13:55.420 --> 13:58.930
<b>This is all a result of your conceit, 
the consequences of your own actions!</b>

13:59.730 --> 14:03.180
<b>Splitting us up and 
attacking us separately.</b>

14:03.180 --> 14:05.160
<b>It's a great plan!</b>

14:05.160 --> 14:09.680
<b>But you need to take into consideration 
whether or not you can win.</b>

14:10.500 --> 14:16.370
<b>Even if you split up your forces 
because you've lost so many heroes,</b>

14:16.370 --> 14:19.990
<b>you really are a cruel man, Endeavor.</b>

14:20.430 --> 14:23.580
<b>Did you pit One For All against Tomura?</b>

14:23.580 --> 14:25.590
<b>That's a huge risk.</b>

14:26.220 --> 14:27.710
<b>Moreover,</b>

14:26.300 --> 14:31.510
<b>Camino Ward</b>

14:28.130 --> 14:31.920
<b>there's the cruelest matchup of all--</b>

14:32.400 --> 14:36.550
<b>Putting your youngest child in the difficult 
situation of cleaning up your mess,</b>

14:36.550 --> 14:40.130
<b>and continuing the abuse 
against your eldest!</b>

14:40.990 --> 14:43.190
<b>We've split up the villains 
according to plan!</b>

14:43.710 --> 14:46.770
<b>It appears the fighting has 
commenced at each location.</b>

14:47.100 --> 14:50.160
<b>The real battle starts now, All Might.</b>

14:50.160 --> 14:50.910
<b>Yeah.</b>

14:55.910 --> 14:59.710
<b>Sky above U.A. High</b>

15:11.560 --> 15:13.130
<b>U.A.?</b>

15:13.130 --> 15:14.640
<b>What is this place?</b>

15:19.540 --> 15:21.040
<b>Denim Head, this is bad!</b>

15:21.750 --> 15:22.820
<b>They got us!</b>

15:23.140 --> 15:24.090
<b>Deku's--</b>

15:26.650 --> 15:29.650
<b>Okuto Island</b>

15:35.470 --> 15:37.150
<b>Deku's not here!</b>

15:37.580 --> 15:38.650
<b>Deku?!</b>

15:39.040 --> 15:40.180
<b>Why?</b>

15:40.180 --> 15:42.190
<b>Shouldn't you be with Shigaraki?</b>

15:42.960 --> 15:46.450
<b>Danger Sense didn't activate...!</b>

15:50.760 --> 15:53.520
<b>Himiko Toga...</b>

15:54.440 --> 15:56.220
<b>Deku's not here?</b>

15:56.600 --> 15:57.650
<b>What happened?</b>

15:57.650 --> 15:58.850
<b>I don't know!</b>

15:58.850 --> 16:00.570
<b>He was pulled somewhere else!</b>

16:00.570 --> 16:02.620
<b>I-I-Isn't this bad?</b>

16:02.620 --> 16:04.900
<b>Without him, we can't fight 
like we were planning.</b>

16:04.900 --> 16:06.240
<b>We have to tell the others!</b>

16:06.840 --> 16:09.000
<b>Whatever, let's just do this!</b>

16:09.000 --> 16:10.560
<b>It's already started--</b>

16:10.970 --> 16:15.760
<b>The fight against the greatest 
villain in recorded history!</b>

16:18.060 --> 16:20.540
<b>The ground's so far down...</b>

16:21.060 --> 16:22.600
<b>I'm in the sky.</b>

16:22.600 --> 16:23.840
<b>Floating.</b>

16:25.920 --> 16:29.700
<b>No Jailbreakers or Front 
members were brought here.</b>

16:30.260 --> 16:31.430
<b>Just me.</b>

16:32.130 --> 16:33.580
<b>Oh well.</b>

16:34.310 --> 16:38.140
<b>Don't get in my way this time, Me.</b>

16:55.600 --> 16:57.180
<b>An electromagnetic barrier!</b>

16:57.840 --> 16:59.770
<b>My body's getting stiff.</b>

17:00.490 --> 17:01.270
<b>But--</b>

17:01.570 --> 17:02.530
<b>Whoa, there!</b>

17:04.310 --> 17:05.320
<b>You're fraying apart!</b>

17:08.130 --> 17:10.630
<b>As long as you're moving with 
your brain and muscles,</b>

17:10.630 --> 17:14.140
<b>a strong electrical current running 
through your body will stiffen you up.</b>

17:14.140 --> 17:16.110
<b>No matter how strong you are,</b>

17:16.110 --> 17:17.640
<b>it'll work for at least a second!</b>

17:18.890 --> 17:23.940
<b>Blocks from the ground fly up 
and disintegrate in the sky...</b>

17:25.270 --> 17:28.390
<b>They installed this to prevent 
Decay from spreading, huh?</b>

17:29.110 --> 17:29.930
<b>But--</b>

17:30.440 --> 17:32.360
<b>That will lead to your ruin.</b>

17:32.360 --> 17:33.900
<b>Jeanist.</b>

17:34.550 --> 17:36.240
<b>We're floating in the sky, right?</b>

17:36.630 --> 17:38.610
<b>If you use up your ground that fast,</b>

17:38.610 --> 17:41.260
<b>your precious stage will disappear!</b>

17:41.870 --> 17:43.610
<b>No need to worry.</b>

17:44.550 --> 17:46.720
<b>We have plenty of raw material.</b>

17:47.520 --> 17:49.890
<b>Don't you understand yet, Shigaraki?</b>

17:49.890 --> 17:51.580
<b>Has your brain short-circuited?</b>

17:52.090 --> 17:58.300
<b>Coffin in the Sky</b>

17:52.400 --> 17:55.470
<b>This place was created to defeat you--</b>

17:55.470 --> 17:57.130
<b>the Coffin in the Sky!</b>

18:03.810 --> 18:07.850
<b>Plates F10-35 and G10-45 have been damaged.</b>

18:08.180 --> 18:10.560
<b>Okay, we'll replace them right away!</b>

18:10.930 --> 18:12.100
<b>Let's go, everyone!</b>

18:12.100 --> 18:12.920
<b>Okay!</b>

18:13.570 --> 18:15.180
<b>Parts please.</b>

18:16.520 --> 18:19.450
<b>Um, what was your name again?</b>

18:19.970 --> 18:21.200
<b>Creaty.</b>

18:21.530 --> 18:23.630
<b>My friends call me Yao-momo!</b>

18:23.630 --> 18:25.400
<b>Please call me what you wish.</b>

18:26.210 --> 18:28.780
<b>With your widespread attacks 
that cause instant death</b>

18:28.780 --> 18:31.210
<b>and speed of All Might at his peak,</b>

18:32.050 --> 18:35.050
<b>we needed to figure out 
where to detain you.</b>

18:36.190 --> 18:40.770
<b>The two battles we fought against you 
after you awakened showed us the way.</b>

18:42.150 --> 18:43.440
<b>That's pretty good.</b>

18:43.810 --> 18:45.880
<b>Let's make it fly!</b>

18:46.370 --> 18:49.470
<b>A mere 16-year-old girl made this possible.</b>

18:50.460 --> 18:53.060
<b>The evacuation system 
suggested by the principal</b>

18:53.060 --> 18:54.810
<b>was added to the countermeasures 
against Decay.</b>

18:55.670 --> 18:58.050
<b>Splitting the area blocks 
into even smaller sections</b>

18:58.050 --> 19:00.350
<b>and turning them into drones 
with an upgraded program.</b>

19:01.260 --> 19:04.280
<b>There weren't enough raw materials due 
to the collapse of the supply chain,</b>

19:06.660 --> 19:08.650
<b>it needed to be constructed 
in a short timeframe,</b>

19:10.720 --> 19:15.760
<b>and a lot of energy was needed for its 
movement and the electromagnetic barrier.</b>

19:16.910 --> 19:19.850
<b>Wow! Manga, isn't this crazy?</b>

19:19.850 --> 19:21.250
<b>You feeling it?</b>

19:21.250 --> 19:22.900
<b>It's like I'm screaming "Whoa!"</b>

19:22.550 --> 19:27.140
<b>Whoa</b>

19:22.900 --> 19:24.270
<b>First years! Focus!</b>

19:24.270 --> 19:27.140
<b>We're basically second years, 
though. Right, Manga?</b>

19:27.140 --> 19:28.810
<b>We're the cornerstones!</b>

19:28.810 --> 19:31.530
<b>Let's do our best so we can 
keep Shigaraki locked up!</b>

19:31.530 --> 19:33.450
<b>Yeah!</b>

19:33.450 --> 19:37.030
<b>Charge your best, Chargebolt!</b>

19:37.560 --> 19:40.300
<b>Everything that we've done up until now</b>

19:40.300 --> 19:42.490
<b>is powering this coffin!</b>

19:43.580 --> 19:45.700
<b>It's not for fame or glory.</b>

19:46.300 --> 19:49.790
<b>We are just doing this because 
we want to protect the future.</b>

19:50.520 --> 19:52.180
<b>We are the ones</b>

19:52.860 --> 19:54.720
<b>who will stop your destruction!</b>

20:13.130 --> 20:15.570
<b>It's time to stop showing off your toys.</b>

20:15.570 --> 20:16.940
<b>With a shock wave...</b>

20:16.940 --> 20:18.240
<b>It's no use!</b>

20:18.240 --> 20:21.100
<b>Did you forget the shitty 
game we played at Jaku?</b>

20:23.760 --> 20:25.020
<b>My Quirk...</b>

20:33.850 --> 20:38.570
<b>You don't like Erasure, 
right, Mr. Last Boss?</b>

20:38.570 --> 20:40.330
<b>Don't move. You'll be out of position.</b>

20:41.770 --> 20:46.820
<b>I can't move, but as long as I 
keep contact with him like this,</b>

20:46.820 --> 20:50.400
<b>Monoma can use Copy past his 
limit of five minutes.</b>

20:51.120 --> 20:54.740
<b>We were supposed to create an advantageous 
situation for Midoriya like this</b>

20:54.740 --> 20:56.970
<b>with him at the center of the operation.</b>

20:57.410 --> 20:58.760
<b>But...</b>

20:59.160 --> 21:01.910
<b>This is bad. Midoriya's not here.</b>

21:02.290 --> 21:03.830
<b>On top of that,</b>

21:04.400 --> 21:09.080
<b>back then, Shigaraki's 
body wasn't complete.</b>

21:23.800 --> 21:26.380
<b>Dynamight, what's that? 
What can you tell us?</b>

21:26.380 --> 21:27.930
<b>Dunno! Never seen it--</b>

21:37.410 --> 21:40.800
<b>I thought you were cool...</b>

21:41.760 --> 21:45.320
<b>I'm really disappointed,</b>

21:46.950 --> 21:49.160
<b>Eraser Head.</b>

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
<b>Preview</b>

23:21.070 --> 23:21.990
<b>Here's the preview!</b>

23:22.750 --> 23:25.590
<b>The intense decisive battle continues.</b>

23:26.100 --> 23:30.560
<b>Even though the heroes' plan to 
separate the villains succeeded,</b>

23:30.920 --> 23:33.680
<b>I was the only one who didn't end 
up where I was supposed to be.</b>

23:34.690 --> 23:36.520
<b>Get back, Izuku Midoriya!</b>

23:36.880 --> 23:38.760
<b>To protect everyone!</b>

23:39.580 --> 23:41.680
<b>Next time, "Inflation."</b>

23:42.260 --> 23:45.990
<b>That girl sings of love 
in the midst of war.</b>

23:45.980 --> 23:49.980
<b>Next time: Inflation</b>

23:46.610 --> 23:48.230
<b>Go beyond!</b>

23:48.230 --> 23:49.610
<b>Plus Ultra!</b>
