WEBVTT

00:20.740 --> 00:22.830
They won't be escaping.

00:23.370 --> 00:26.210
The scout plane made sure of that.

00:27.990 --> 00:32.200
We'll pin them down and 
assassinate the enemy scientist.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.470
A-A-Assassinate?!

00:35.720 --> 00:41.020
According to that gentleman, Mr. Gen, 
there's only one OP scientist.

00:41.460 --> 00:46.150
In other words, in order to bring 
down the Youth Kingdom of Science...

00:47.390 --> 00:50.680
we need only to erase their leader,

00:54.560 --> 00:56.740
Doctor Taiju.

00:59.050 --> 01:01.740
That's a legit good idea!

01:01.740 --> 01:04.660
B-B-But can you really pull that off?

01:10.900 --> 01:12.180
We can.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.750
How?

01:18.420 --> 01:19.700
I can.

01:21.410 --> 01:28.750
Oh, Mr. Gen, if Stan says he can do it, 
you have no reason to ask him anything else.

01:30.270 --> 01:32.070
It can be done.

01:33.270 --> 01:36.120
<i>I'm so sorry, Doctor Taiju-chan.</i>

01:36.120 --> 01:42.080
<i>I need to tell him to beware of 
the assassin headed his way...</i>

01:42.570 --> 01:45.290
<i>But they'd obviously eavesdrop on our radios.</i>

01:45.880 --> 01:49.460
<i>And there's no way to get in touch 
with them when I'm being watched.</i>

01:56.950 --> 02:00.070
<i>This is pretty bad.</i>

03:48.380 --> 03:52.410
Can we really trust this Gen guy?

03:53.010 --> 03:54.630
Trust?

03:54.630 --> 04:02.820
Anyone who trusts an enemy defector should 
get their head checked right away.

04:03.850 --> 04:07.980
I'll keep him until he 
gives up some information.

04:07.980 --> 04:10.470
He's almost certainly an enemy spy.

04:11.020 --> 04:12.900
R-Right!

04:12.900 --> 04:16.570
Of course he is! I knew that!

04:16.570 --> 04:20.950
I just wanted to make sure you weren't 
letting your guard down, Stanley.

04:20.950 --> 04:23.030
Yup, I was just testing.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.230
Why are you stopping, Luna?

04:32.230 --> 04:35.500
Y-You're just going too fast!

04:37.880 --> 04:40.050
Check this out, miss!

04:40.050 --> 04:43.260
I'm carrying five more bottles than he is!

04:43.490 --> 04:44.770
My ass you are!

04:44.770 --> 04:49.270
I know you're filling each one 
with less water to fake it!

04:49.270 --> 04:52.530
Carlos! Max! You're both late!

04:52.530 --> 04:54.790
It couldn't have been that 
hard to get food and water.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.560
It's so much, though!

04:56.820 --> 04:58.720
Why do we need so much?

04:59.040 --> 05:01.940
You won't catch me whining, miss!

05:02.160 --> 05:06.280
Unlike this wannabe pick-up artist!

05:05.220 --> 05:08.680
Your legs are shaking like a newborn deer!

05:08.680 --> 05:09.740
Mister elephant!

05:09.300 --> 05:10.650
Don't!

05:16.150 --> 05:17.960
You're so useless.

05:19.220 --> 05:22.250
All right, fine. You're leaving me no choice.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.300
I'll help carry some.

05:24.300 --> 05:28.470
You mustn't, miss!
I'll take care of all of it!

05:28.470 --> 05:30.060
You can give up acting tough!

05:30.060 --> 05:33.430
Just take a nap! I'll carry it!

05:35.580 --> 05:38.450
They're totally hopeless.

05:38.450 --> 05:40.770
Luna, you aren't carrying any.

05:40.770 --> 05:42.920
But those two can't...

05:48.050 --> 05:51.880
Let me make it clear: 
I never said you don't <i>have to</i>.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.160
I said you <i>aren't</i>.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.790
Don't leave evidence on your body 
that you did any heavy lifting.

05:58.790 --> 06:02.040
You still have work after this.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.020
Work?

06:18.520 --> 06:20.540
<i>The air's stagnant.</i>

06:21.440 --> 06:22.650
<i>Not a good sign.</i>

06:23.540 --> 06:26.350
<i>You can always trust a sailor's instincts.</i>

06:30.680 --> 06:32.610
Is that the enemy ship?

06:33.590 --> 06:35.370
It's huge!

06:35.370 --> 06:37.360
W-Wow.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.930
That enemy science guy isn't bad.

06:39.930 --> 06:42.060
Though there's no way he's as good as Xeno.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.090
Is that for measuring the 
temperature and humidity?

06:49.660 --> 06:51.660
And that's a wind vane?

06:51.660 --> 06:54.810
Brought to us by our ever-caring Doctor Xeno.

06:55.330 --> 06:58.820
I told him I can figure it out by feel.

06:58.820 --> 07:02.110
Though, the more data I have, 
the more certain I can be.

07:03.230 --> 07:05.710
Why are you checking the weather?

07:05.710 --> 07:08.150
Are you doing weather forecasts or something?

07:09.700 --> 07:12.150
The weather affects my bullet velocity.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.580
You aren't gonna...

07:25.220 --> 07:26.840
From this distance?!

07:28.620 --> 07:30.720
I'm sniping him.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.410
Snipe...

07:37.410 --> 07:42.690
I'm taking out the enemy science leader 
with Xeno's sniper rifle of science.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.360
Snipe?!

07:44.360 --> 07:45.940
Yep, that's right.

07:46.440 --> 07:51.400
We avoid a full-on confrontation 
and eliminate key targets,

07:51.400 --> 07:55.160
finishing combat with minimal casualties.

07:55.570 --> 08:00.410
Sniping is the most elegant, 
scientific means of warfare, is it not?

08:09.030 --> 08:11.720
We've already got a read on 
them with our scout plane.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.590
This is the optimal position.

08:14.050 --> 08:16.090
Y-You're killing them?

08:16.490 --> 08:19.350
Just the enemy science leader.

08:19.350 --> 08:22.390
Don't you think that's a little too cruel?

08:29.360 --> 08:30.910
Just kidding!

08:30.910 --> 08:36.370
But I gotta make sure these 
two don't chicken out, right?

08:36.370 --> 08:38.150
You're so cool, miss!

08:38.150 --> 08:40.490
S-So, so cool! You're the best!

08:40.900 --> 08:44.650
Also... what's that job for me 
you were talking about earlier?

08:44.650 --> 08:47.710
What's with this striped outfit?

08:47.710 --> 08:50.500
You look fantastic.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.440
Well, Stanley's a guy, after all.

08:52.440 --> 08:53.490
Must be his thing.

08:53.490 --> 08:54.970
She's just so pretty.

08:54.970 --> 08:57.370
Each stripe is five inches.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.350
You're a tape measure.

08:59.990 --> 09:03.390
I can line you up to get a 
precise distance to the target.

09:05.530 --> 09:10.330
Luna, you're just about the same age as them. 
They'll be the least suspicious of you.

09:10.970 --> 09:16.110
Get on the ship and find their 
leader scientist, Doctor Taiju.

09:16.370 --> 09:17.750
I only need three seconds.

09:17.750 --> 09:21.990
Bring him out on the deck for three 
seconds, and give me a signal.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.960
I'll take him out in a single shot.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.720
<i>I'm the cool-headed Luna.</i>

09:36.720 --> 09:39.600
<i>I'm Luna, a capable woman!</i>

09:44.400 --> 09:48.980
<i>They would've survived if they'd taken 
the ship out into the open seas.</i>

09:49.680 --> 09:52.480
<i>They only stayed because they 
can't leave their buddies behind.</i>

09:52.480 --> 09:55.010
<i>Can't expect much grit from a bunch of kids.</i>

09:59.430 --> 10:01.530
<i>Knowing that...</i>

10:02.690 --> 10:06.790
<i>they're bound to come to the rescue 
if they see a chick begging for help.</i>

10:03.110 --> 10:04.630
Help me!

10:09.130 --> 10:11.800
<i>They sent in a spy,</i>

10:11.800 --> 10:16.710
<i>so we'll counter with a spy ourselves.</i>

10:17.830 --> 10:19.530
What's wrong? Are you all right?

10:19.530 --> 10:21.140
Help me, please!

10:21.680 --> 10:25.600
I barely escaped from the 
terrible Doctor Xeno's kingdom!

10:26.220 --> 10:27.310
Doctor Xeno?!

10:28.280 --> 10:29.480
She's cute.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.600
Is this really the time?

10:33.780 --> 10:35.570
<i>This is a tough call.</i>

10:36.410 --> 10:38.860
<i>I'd love to help her,</i>

10:38.860 --> 10:41.070
<i>but we can't take her at her word.</i>

10:41.540 --> 10:43.950
<i>What are you going to do, Senku?</i>

10:46.280 --> 10:47.750
Are you all right?

10:47.750 --> 10:49.950
You're safe now.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.340
Come aboard the ship.

10:54.450 --> 10:56.560
Th-Thank you.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.510
Get her inside to treat her wounds!

11:05.750 --> 11:07.240
Slick...

11:07.240 --> 11:08.480
Senku...

11:18.450 --> 11:21.150
She's in! I knew she could do it!

11:21.150 --> 11:23.770
The enemy's all over her!

11:24.590 --> 11:29.410
Stanley's putting her in so 
much danger! That asshole!

11:29.950 --> 11:34.930
Man, how many hours are we going 
to wait here until we snipe... them...

11:36.380 --> 11:38.150
Right, of course.

11:38.150 --> 11:43.620
We're waiting until she brings the target 
out onto the deck. As long as it takes.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.110
And that's what all this water's for?

11:46.110 --> 11:49.640
So you can stay focused for as many 
hundreds of hours as it takes?

11:49.640 --> 11:53.250
Stanley's a total freak.

11:53.820 --> 12:00.020
So, which one of you is the 
famed science boy, Doctor Taiju?

12:05.450 --> 12:06.490
Hey.

12:07.070 --> 12:08.850
Let's treat your wounds over here.

12:09.200 --> 12:13.640
She's suspicious.
Is it really safe to bring her aboard?

12:13.640 --> 12:16.140
Sure we can. She's got a cute face.

12:17.090 --> 12:19.320
I mean, Senku's a dude, too.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.740
He's head over heels.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.500
He probably has a thing for blondes.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.510
I'm not sure about that.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.180
That woman...

12:31.650 --> 12:34.470
There's a fifty-fifty chanceâ€”no,

12:34.470 --> 12:36.460
a 70 percent chance she's an enemy spy.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.240
Not a problem!

12:39.240 --> 12:43.070
We're going to extract everything
she knows about Xeno's crew...

12:44.000 --> 12:47.890
and transmit an encrypted message 
to Tsukasa's special squad.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.790
The most powerful weapon in a 
science battle is information.

12:51.790 --> 12:53.610
Spy versus spy.

12:53.610 --> 12:56.780
We're two sly foxes outfoxing each other.

12:56.780 --> 12:58.920
I knew it wasn't what it looked like!

13:16.390 --> 13:19.400
I don't see anything that 
could be the enemy base.

13:19.810 --> 13:23.950
We can't get more than a rough 
idea of where Chrome is, either.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.280
It'd be nice to have a bit more information.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.150
We need to capture the enemy science 
leader before they get ours.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.180
That means gathering intel as quickly as we can.

13:40.190 --> 13:46.930
Anyway, we're hoping to cooperate 
with you to revive all of humanity!

13:47.230 --> 13:52.510
We aren't going to surrender or anything, 
but we're always open to discussions!

13:54.410 --> 13:56.600
So the enemy can hear this, too?

13:56.600 --> 13:58.220
Radio transmissions.

13:58.220 --> 13:59.720
Just in case.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.710
We have to give it a shot, you know?

14:03.080 --> 14:06.150
We don't even know what 
Doctor Xeno is like, but...

14:20.030 --> 14:22.420
<i>My mission...</i>

14:23.310 --> 14:27.560
<i>is to find the science leader, Doctor Taiju, 
and bring him onto the deck.</i>

14:28.690 --> 14:30.120
<i>That's a lot of people...</i>

14:30.120 --> 14:31.720
<i>This could be pretty tough.</i>

14:33.310 --> 14:35.030
<i>Nah, no problem!</i>

14:35.030 --> 14:37.700
<i>I'm the cool-headed Luna!</i>

14:37.700 --> 14:39.730
<i>The capable woman, Luna!</i>

14:39.730 --> 14:43.930
<i>I can't just go up and ask, 
"Which one's Doctor Taiju?"</i>

14:43.930 --> 14:46.690
<i>They're still suspicious of me as it is.</i>

14:48.010 --> 14:50.240
<i>Based on my profiling...</i>

14:51.010 --> 14:53.960
<i>he's an intellectual who single-handedly led</i>

14:53.960 --> 14:57.530
<i>the youth in advancing stone world 
science all the way to here.</i>

14:57.530 --> 15:01.800
<i>A hard-working, diligent man who oozes smarts.</i>

15:02.510 --> 15:05.340
<i>That's totally my type!</i>

15:05.580 --> 15:09.460
<i>In other words, I have to 
find someone who's my type!</i>

15:10.510 --> 15:14.950
<i>I'll use my own emotions in 
the service of my mission!</i>

15:14.950 --> 15:17.970
<i>I'm so cold and capable!</i>

15:21.740 --> 15:22.810
<i>This man?</i>

15:24.330 --> 15:25.650
<i>Nope.</i>

15:30.170 --> 15:31.350
<i>This man?!</i>

15:35.020 --> 15:36.370
<i>Nope.</i>

15:37.480 --> 15:39.030
<i>This... man...</i>

15:39.950 --> 15:40.840
<i>Nah.</i>

15:44.450 --> 15:46.090
<i>Definitely not.</i>

15:51.180 --> 15:56.100
<i>There's a good chance he won't show himself 
that quickly in front of an outsider like me.</i>

15:56.100 --> 15:59.100
<i>I might be in this for the long haul.</i>

15:59.100 --> 16:01.310
<i>Which one is Doctor Taiju?</i>

16:03.040 --> 16:03.950
Taiju-kun.

16:03.950 --> 16:05.110
Yeah?

16:08.820 --> 16:10.330
We were looking for you.

16:10.330 --> 16:12.820
There's something heavy we need you to carry.

16:12.820 --> 16:14.220
Oh, my bad.

16:14.220 --> 16:15.570
I'll be on my way.

16:22.570 --> 16:25.190
<i>Not the ideal image of a scientist...</i>

16:25.190 --> 16:26.600
<i>But that's all right.</i>

16:26.600 --> 16:30.550
<i>Anyone else might have missed you, Doctor Taiju.</i>

16:30.760 --> 16:33.280
<i>Now comes the hard part.</i>

16:33.280 --> 16:36.320
<i>He's going to be aboard the ship, 
focused on science work.</i>

16:36.320 --> 16:38.450
<i>He won't be so quick to come outside.</i>

16:38.450 --> 16:41.340
<i>How do I lure him onto the deck?</i>

16:42.170 --> 16:45.870
I'm on my way back on deck!

16:48.910 --> 16:50.900
<i>I just need to point at him!</i>

16:51.860 --> 16:54.650
<i>And... that'll be...</i>

16:54.890 --> 16:55.960
Heya.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.370
Luna-san, was it?

16:59.340 --> 17:00.880
I'm Senku.

17:01.810 --> 17:03.210
<i>It's so natural...</i>

17:03.210 --> 17:04.710
<i>Slick Senku...</i>

17:04.710 --> 17:09.090
<i>He's trying to slowly pry information 
about Doctor Xeno out of her.</i>

17:09.720 --> 17:11.410
I need info on Xeno.

17:11.410 --> 17:13.080
Tell me everything you know.

17:16.290 --> 17:17.210
Senku.

17:17.210 --> 17:17.840
What?

17:18.620 --> 17:21.870
I'm right in the middle of interrogations.

17:21.870 --> 17:24.640
Allow Francois to tend to our guest.

17:25.190 --> 17:28.560
We first need her to open up to us.

17:29.370 --> 17:31.610
Please make use of Bar FranÃ§ois.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.660
To get her on our side, 
we need to answer to her wants!

17:40.380 --> 17:44.810
So long as we don't know what Luna-sama 
wants, we'll simply have to guess.

17:45.750 --> 17:51.190
In that case, the one thing that 
no one in the world hates...

17:52.610 --> 17:54.170
Ice cream!

17:54.170 --> 17:56.320
I'm gonna need some citations on that.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.850
I'm citing me, the foremost authority on greed.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.530
He's right, though.

18:00.530 --> 18:03.970
I can't think of anything that fewer 
people would hate than ice cream.

18:03.970 --> 18:07.690
I've never heard of anyone who 
says they don't like ice cream.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.310
The ingredients are exceedingly simple.

18:10.930 --> 18:11.990
Milk.

18:11.990 --> 18:12.800
Sugar.

18:13.110 --> 18:13.990
Gelatin...

18:13.990 --> 18:18.050
Or, in our case, we'll use powdered arrowroot.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.320
It'll give it a smooth texture.

18:20.590 --> 18:23.520
Now we just need some vanilla essence.

18:26.900 --> 18:30.970
Vanilla doesn't grow in the States, 
so we're synthesizing ours with science.

18:30.970 --> 18:35.590
I do remember you making some 
for Valentine's Day, too.

18:36.090 --> 18:41.090
Wrap a test tube with copper wire, 
toss in some iron,

18:41.090 --> 18:44.510
and zap it with some portable high-voltage!

18:46.080 --> 18:47.750
It's glowing purple!

18:51.720 --> 18:53.640
What is he up to?

18:57.010 --> 18:58.480
It smells like a pool!

18:58.480 --> 19:00.610
More like a photocopier.

19:00.610 --> 19:02.720
It's producing ozone.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.420
We're getting further and 
further from ice cream!

19:05.420 --> 19:08.010
Are you sure about this?
Is this supposed to work?

19:08.970 --> 19:10.620
Boil some bay leaf extract

19:10.940 --> 19:17.630
in our good friend sodium hydroxide and 
infuse it with some of that ozone we made...

19:18.670 --> 19:21.230
and you get vanilla essence.

19:21.930 --> 19:23.590
Out of nowhere!

19:23.590 --> 19:25.810
A sweet scent...

19:30.040 --> 19:33.300
We stir the ingredients well as we let it cool.

19:33.300 --> 19:37.770
Throw some salt onto ice and you can get 
it ten or twenty degrees below freezing.

19:44.210 --> 19:46.070
<i>Doctor Taiju's on the deck!</i>

19:46.070 --> 19:48.330
<i>If I go up to him and point...</i>

19:48.630 --> 19:49.580
Whoa, there.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.160
What are you up to?

19:52.750 --> 19:54.960
You're hurt. You need to take it easy.

19:56.260 --> 19:59.300
Thanks. It's okay.

19:59.300 --> 20:03.580
Then just put it in a bag and squeeze it out...

20:06.510 --> 20:09.330
and you've got soft serve.

20:15.150 --> 20:16.200
Here you go.

20:51.390 --> 20:53.520
Was it that electricity?

20:54.050 --> 20:55.750
How did you...

20:55.750 --> 20:57.410
Do you even have vanilla?

20:57.410 --> 21:00.260
When you don't, you make do.

21:00.870 --> 21:03.530
Two million years of human tenacity.

21:04.350 --> 21:08.440
You reach into the fundamentals of 
realityâ€”into the moleculesâ€”

21:08.440 --> 21:11.020
and make things that aren't supposed to exist.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.540
That's the real thrill of organic chemistry.

21:17.020 --> 21:18.470
<i>No! No!</i>

21:18.470 --> 21:20.940
<i>I'm supposed to be attracted to intellectuals!</i>

21:20.940 --> 21:23.800
<i>Doctor Taiju is the science leader!</i>

21:23.800 --> 21:27.070
I-It came out pretty nicely, huh?

21:27.070 --> 21:31.810
In Xeno's words, it's extremely...

21:34.120 --> 21:35.730
elegant.

21:38.960 --> 21:39.940
Luna...

21:41.730 --> 21:44.980
Was Doctor Xeno a former NASA scientist?

21:45.750 --> 21:47.360
How did you know?!

21:52.500 --> 21:53.620
Who is he?

21:57.060 --> 21:58.690
Doctor Xeno...

21:59.270 --> 22:01.630
He got me started on rocket building.

22:08.370 --> 22:11.290
He's my science mentor.

23:51.990 --> 23:54.950
