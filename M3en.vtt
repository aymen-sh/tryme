<b><i>At Easton Magic Academy,
each dorm is overseen by a prefect.</i></b>

00:08.650 --> 00:13.650
<b><i>The three prefects boasts
some of the greatest talent in Easton.</i></b>

00:13.780 --> 00:18.580
<b><i>All of them have the skills necessary
to become a Divine Visionary.</i></b>

01:54.460 --> 02:01.800
<b><i>A few years ago, a tournament was held for
13-15 year olds in the middle school division.</i></b>

02:03.010 --> 02:07.180
<b><i>One magic user singlehandedly
overpowered all the other competitors.</i></b>

02:08.270 --> 02:10.020
<b><i>They had only been nine at the time.</i></b>

02:10.480 --> 02:13.110
<b><i>Their name was Margarette Macaron.</i></b>

02:13.360 --> 02:16.570
<b><i>The future prefect of Orca dorm.</i></b>

02:17.780 --> 02:20.360
<b>Well, well. If it isn't the Sword Cane...</b>

02:20.570 --> 02:22.530
<b>Rayne Ames.</b>

02:22.950 --> 02:25.040
<b>Of all people...</b>

02:25.120 --> 02:29.040
<b>Not only will I face Mash Burnedead,
but a Divine Visionary</b>

02:29.170 --> 02:31.670
<b>will also entertain me?</b>

02:38.380 --> 02:40.430
<b>But you are...</b>

03:48.330 --> 03:52.210
<b>The powerless... winter.</b>

03:59.420 --> 04:02.220
<b><i>What the hell is going on here?</i></b>

04:03.880 --> 04:07.510
<b>Not every powerful magic user
strives to be a Divine Visionary.</b>

04:07.850 --> 04:11.270
<b>"Divine Visionary" is just a title, after all.</b>

04:12.140 --> 04:15.400
<b>Compared to myself who genuinely
sought nothing but strength,</b>

04:15.600 --> 04:19.070
<b>and you who sought a superficial position.</b>

04:20.650 --> 04:24.200
<b>Which one of us is stronger?</b>

04:31.450 --> 04:32.830
<b>Partisan.</b>

04:33.790 --> 04:35.080
<b>Sounds.</b>

04:40.000 --> 04:42.050
<b>Okay, I'll roll first.</b>

04:44.800 --> 04:46.680
<b>A 67.</b>

04:49.970 --> 04:51.470
<b>Let's see...</b>

04:51.560 --> 04:57.940
<b>"Easily duped by a scheming beauty's
charm spell. Lose five million Lond."</b>

04:58.190 --> 05:00.820
<b>What the hell!?
This board game's a piece of crap!</b>

05:02.190 --> 05:03.900
<b>Oh, no!</b>

05:04.320 --> 05:06.530
<b>I'm next.</b>

05:08.200 --> 05:10.080
<b>A 25.</b>

05:12.410 --> 05:16.870
<b>"Head to holding cell for restraining
a love interest like a stalker."</b>

05:17.370 --> 05:19.590
<b>"Skip 320 turns."</b>

05:21.380 --> 05:26.090
<b>This board game might be dangerous
as it may predict our futures.</b>

05:27.590 --> 05:34.230
<b>"Your little sister suddenly brings home
a boyfriend. Return to start"!?</b>

05:38.230 --> 05:42.070
<b>"Return a lost item to the police.

05:42.940 --> 05:44.070
<b>I'm glad.</b>

05:44.490 --> 05:47.070
<b>All right. Guess I'm next.</b>

05:48.410 --> 05:50.280
<b>A 98.</b>

05:52.660 --> 05:54.120
<b>Let's see...</b>

05:54.290 --> 05:57.580
<b>"It's discovered you can't use magic,
and you are executed."</b>

05:58.290 --> 05:59.790
<b>"Game over."</b>

06:04.340 --> 06:05.800
<b>Game over!?</b>

06:06.050 --> 06:08.970
<b>Gotta laugh. Just gotta laugh it off!</b>

06:08.970 --> 06:11.050
<b>What's up with this board game!?</b>

06:11.350 --> 06:13.560
<b>- Graviole. Graviole. Graviole.
- Just let 'em try!</b>

06:13.640 --> 06:16.310
<b>- Graviole. Graviole. Graviole.
- Yeah, let 'em try!</b>

06:16.520 --> 06:19.310
<b>- Graviole. Graviole. Graviole.
- Just let 'em try!</b>

06:20.150 --> 06:24.190
<b><i>I never dreamed he'd be surrounded

06:29.280 --> 06:31.990
<b><i>I'm sure it will.</i></b>

06:33.030 --> 06:36.950
<b>- I'm the future wife, you hear?
- More like, what the hell is this thing!?</b>

06:34.790 --> 06:36.450
<b>I have to keep it going.</b>

06:37.790 --> 06:39.000
<b>Partisan!</b>

06:40.420 --> 06:42.000
<b>Shiver Sounds!</b>

06:46.050 --> 06:47.760
<b>Howling Sounds!</b>

07:00.690 --> 07:03.270
<b>I wouldn't attack if I were you.</b>

07:04.060 --> 07:07.860
<b>They'll explode in response
to your spellcasting.</b>

07:09.360 --> 07:11.030
<b>Rayne Ames.</b>

07:11.780 --> 07:16.290
<b>Do you know why we desire stimulation?</b>

07:16.830 --> 07:23.130
<b>Art, love, sports, drinking,
drugs, gambling...</b>

07:23.330 --> 07:28.050
<b>None of these things are necessary
to live a normal life.</b>

07:28.170 --> 07:30.010
<b>So why seek them?</b>

07:31.090 --> 07:33.180
<b>The answer is simple.</b>

07:33.970 --> 07:37.140
<b>Because boredom is as good as death.</b>

07:39.850 --> 07:43.560
<b>We live for those stimulations.</b>

07:44.190 --> 07:46.110
<b>Yet, you...</b>

07:46.480 --> 07:50.320
<b>You're awfully easygoing,
meddling in other's business.</b>

07:52.320 --> 07:53.950
<b>How boring.</b>

07:54.910 --> 07:59.830
<b>I can't imagine someone with values
like you could ever fulfill me.</b>

08:00.080 --> 08:02.120
<b>Be a dear and step aside.</b>

08:02.210 --> 08:05.580
<b>I've got to see Mash Burnedead.</b>

08:06.380 --> 08:08.590
<b>He's a brazen kid.</b>

08:09.300 --> 08:12.260
<b>Brazen enough to tell me...</b>

08:12.970 --> 08:16.600
<b>that he will become a Divine Visionary
even without magic.</b>

08:17.100 --> 08:19.850
<b>That he will change the perception
of this world.</b>

08:23.890 --> 08:26.610
<b><i>His mood shifted?</i></b>

08:27.150 --> 08:32.280
<b>If he went against Margarette, not even
Lord Rayne would walk away unscathed.</b>

08:33.900 --> 08:38.410
<b>Rayne may act aloof,
but he always takes care of others.</b>

08:38.830 --> 08:40.660
<b>By the way, Nerey...</b>

08:40.830 --> 08:44.250
<b>What do you know about marks?</b>

08:44.580 --> 08:50.170
<b>Well, the number of marks increases
in accordance with your absolute magic power?</b>

08:50.250 --> 08:51.630
<b>Correct.</b>

08:51.800 --> 08:58.760
<b>Easton Magic Academy has had
many double-liners cross our step, of course.</b>

08:59.180 --> 09:04.440
<b>But there have only been an extremely
small number of triple-liners.</b>

09:05.020 --> 09:09.770
<b>If two lines means magic itself
recognizes their talent,</b>

09:09.770 --> 09:13.530
<b>then those with three lines
must be chosen by the gods.</b>

09:13.990 --> 09:17.160
<b>The summer... of bliss.</b>

09:17.660 --> 09:22.660
<b>And the youngest to ever
acquire three lines is...</b>

09:23.330 --> 09:26.540
<b>the one named Rayne Ames.</b>

09:27.040 --> 09:29.590
<b>Change the perception of this world...</b>

09:29.790 --> 09:34.470
<b>I'll make sure that brazen kid
goes as far as he can go.</b>

09:37.470 --> 09:40.640
<b>"It's discovered
you can't use magic. Executed."</b>

09:44.020 --> 09:46.270
<b>I'm gonna get some fresh air.</b>

09:47.440 --> 09:51.650
<b>He acts cool,
but it must be eating him up inside.</b>

09:51.650 --> 09:55.490
<b>Of course it is.
He didn't do anything wrong.</b>

09:55.490 --> 09:59.990
<b>If I were in his shoes,
I would keep blaming society.</b>

10:11.340 --> 10:13.460
<b>No one will ever spot me out here.</b>

10:14.960 --> 10:19.010
<b>I can't eat this specialty cream puff
in everyone's presence.</b>

10:25.310 --> 10:29.190
<b><i>A triple-liner. A talent gifted by the gods.</i></b>

10:29.940 --> 10:33.690
<b><i>To find someone my age
who's achieved that level.</i></b>

10:34.780 --> 10:37.700
<b><i>Just how blessed am I?</i></b>

10:38.610 --> 10:43.160
<b><i>Howling Sounds will create a chain explosion
in reaction to chanting.</i></b>

10:43.450 --> 10:48.960
<b><i>He may be a triple-liner,
but he has to chant to use magic.</i></b>

10:49.160 --> 10:51.540
<b>Orter Madl put you up to this, didn't he?</b>

10:52.420 --> 10:56.710
<b>It's not like you to take an interest
in school affairs, but you're here.</b>

10:56.840 --> 10:59.510
<b>This pretty much has to be
Orter Madl's doing.</b>

10:59.510 --> 11:02.470
<b>Dear me. I have no idea
what you're talking about.</b>

11:04.510 --> 11:08.600
<b>Your target Mash Burnedead
can't use magic.</b>

11:10.600 --> 11:15.440
<b>In this world, lack of magic
is basically having no human rights.</b>

11:15.770 --> 11:18.690
<b>An ordinary human
would feel despair, no doubt.</b>

11:19.450 --> 11:23.990
<b>Jealous of those who can use magic,
regretting being ever born, hating society...</b>

11:23.990 --> 11:26.580
<b>All of those would be reasonable reactions.</b>

11:27.370 --> 11:31.330
<b>But Mash Burnedead is different.</b>

11:32.040 --> 11:33.130
<b>He...</b>

11:34.340 --> 11:38.130
<b>fights against his own destiny.</b>

11:42.010 --> 11:46.350
<b>Not that an underhanded rat like you
would ever understand.</b>

11:47.140 --> 11:50.140
<b>Oh my. What a darling little speech.</b>

11:51.560 --> 11:52.650
<b>But...</b>

11:53.730 --> 11:56.860
<b>I couldn't care less.</b>

11:59.110 --> 12:03.030
<b><i>They remain confident despite facing down
a triple-liner Divine Visionary.</i></b>

12:03.200 --> 12:06.280
<b><i>They're not being cocky, though.</i></b>

12:06.700 --> 12:10.080
<b><i>They distributed their coins to the dorm, saying
they weren't interested in Divine Visionaries.</i></b>

12:10.080 --> 12:16.670
<b><i>But they took a total of ten gold coins
from upperclassmen, more than anyone last year.</i></b>

12:17.040 --> 12:22.050
<b><i>Besides, Howling Sounds will end
the moment he chants a counterspell.</i></b>

12:22.630 --> 12:27.390
<b><i>This shows Margarette Macaron's
overwhelming talent.</i></b>

12:37.150 --> 12:41.360
<b>I hear it... The unending applause...</b>

12:47.910 --> 12:50.200
<b>Sounds Orchestra.</b>

12:54.210 --> 12:57.330
<b>Now you're forced to cast a spell.</b>

12:57.670 --> 12:58.790
<b>Checkmate.</b>

12:59.130 --> 13:05.050
<b>Um... What exactly distinguishes
a triple-liner from a double-liner?</b>

13:05.180 --> 13:09.430
<b>Three lines signify one chosen by the gods.</b>

13:09.890 --> 13:15.690
<b>They can unleash more power
than a double-liner, of course.</b>

13:15.850 --> 13:18.400
<b>But that is hardly all they can do.</b>

13:18.980 --> 13:24.200
<b>They can awaken
a wand's dormant true form.</b>

13:24.610 --> 13:26.200
<b>True form?</b>

13:26.410 --> 13:32.080
<b>Yes, that's correct. The reason why
lies behind magic being a gift from the gods.</b>

13:42.170 --> 13:45.590
<b><i>Howling Sounds was drowned out
without being activated?</i></b>

13:45.670 --> 13:47.720
<b>Summon Ares.</b>

13:47.970 --> 13:53.350
<b>In other words, their power calls upon
a god's strength from within a wand.</b>

13:53.970 --> 13:56.850
<b><i>His wand is changing form!?</i></b>

13:57.190 --> 14:02.610
<b><i>So this is what was given to Divine Visionary
Rayne Ames, the title of a god's wand...</i></b>

14:03.360 --> 14:05.030
<b>"Sword Cane."</b>

14:05.280 --> 14:06.490
<b>Checkmate.</b>

14:06.610 --> 14:08.320
<b>Black Partisan.</b>

14:13.410 --> 14:15.040
<b>Sounds Shield!</b>

14:29.970 --> 14:34.180
<b>U-Um, I guess I should say thanks.</b>

14:34.470 --> 14:39.690
<b>For what? I was just playing
with some rabbits in the forest.</b>

14:40.770 --> 14:43.690
<b>So you are a fan of rabbits.</b>

14:45.230 --> 14:47.320
<b>The selection exam is soon.</b>

14:47.320 --> 14:48.450
<b>Yes.</b>

14:48.900 --> 14:51.660
<b>I'm terrible at encouraging people.</b>

14:51.910 --> 14:54.950
<b>But I'll say one thing.</b>

14:55.740 --> 14:59.830
<b>You're embarking on a challenge the likes
of which this world has never seen.</b>

15:00.290 --> 15:03.500
<b>Nothing good will ever come
from your failure.</b>

15:05.630 --> 15:06.800
<b>So win.</b>

15:06.800 --> 15:09.590
<b>And give your challenge meaning.</b>

15:10.970 --> 15:12.340
<b>'Kay.</b>

15:17.100 --> 15:19.850
<b>You kids are so sloppy.</b>

15:21.190 --> 15:23.060
<b><i>So that's a triple-liner.</i></b>

15:23.310 --> 15:27.610
<b><i>The gigantic wand raises
the baseline magic power output.</i></b>

15:28.070 --> 15:32.950
<b><i>Even entry-level spells have the effectiveness
of Secondth magic.</i></b>

15:34.160 --> 15:39.750
<b><i>I could have tried my own Secondth spell,
but I put their safety as my priority.</i></b>

15:40.080 --> 15:42.540
<b><i>Is this maternal instinct?</i></b>

15:45.000 --> 15:47.960
<b>Margarette, I'm sorry.</b>

15:48.340 --> 15:49.590
<b>No worries.</b>

15:52.050 --> 15:56.260
<b>As they all say,
you save the best for last.</b>

16:01.140 --> 16:02.310
<b><i>Afterwards...</i></b>

16:03.350 --> 16:06.440
<b>These are the coins we got from Lang.</b>

16:06.520 --> 16:08.570
<b>Three per person sound good?</b>

16:09.190 --> 16:10.780
<b>Let's do our best on the selection exam.</b>

16:11.110 --> 16:12.660
<b>I can't!</b>

16:14.410 --> 16:16.660
<b>I'm sorry!</b>

16:26.250 --> 16:29.670
<b>It'll be soon. Wait for me, Anna.</b>

16:29.670 --> 16:31.170
<b>STARE</b>

16:35.050 --> 16:37.220
<b>I'm too hyped to sleep!</b>

16:37.300 --> 16:39.100
<b>Guess I'll check my luggage.</b>

16:39.430 --> 16:43.850
<b>Water bottle, handkerchief,
bug repellant, tissue.</b>

16:43.940 --> 16:48.110
<b>And then eye drops, antacid,
pain reliever, laxative.</b>

16:48.110 --> 16:51.610
<b>Facial toner, antiperspirant,
breath freshener.</b>

16:53.110 --> 16:56.490
<b>Mash, I heard from your friends.</b>

16:56.740 --> 17:00.740
<b>Everyone has discovered
that you can't use magic?</b>

17:02.200 --> 17:06.250
<b>And that you will be charged with this crime
if you don't meet their demands.</b>

17:11.300 --> 17:14.510
<b>I'm sorry. This is my doing.</b>

17:15.340 --> 17:20.510
<b>If only I could have given you a normal life.</b>

17:21.390 --> 17:25.390
<b>If only I could have provided you
a life without inconveniences.</b>

17:26.520 --> 17:29.940
<b>If I had done more to hide it all to the end.</b>

17:29.940 --> 17:31.440
<b>But I'm happy.</b>

17:32.900 --> 17:35.950
<b>I have you who always
looks out for me so much.</b>

17:36.410 --> 17:41.200
<b>I was able to go to school even for
a little bit, and was blessed with friends.</b>

17:42.370 --> 17:44.870
<b>I got to eat lots of cream puffs, too.</b>

17:46.000 --> 17:47.790
<b>So I'm happy.</b>

17:48.290 --> 17:50.290
<b>Thank you, Pops.</b>

<b><i>Here we have the magic users
who are the pinnacle of this society!</i></b>

18:47.230 --> 18:50.650
<b><i>The examinees have entered the arena!</i></b>

18:51.560 --> 18:56.280
<b>It seems even Margarette Macaron
will enter this year.</b>

18:56.690 --> 19:02.320
<b>You face a difficult road, Mash Burnedead.</b>

18:59.660 --> 19:02.910
<b>MASH BURNEDEAD
ADLER DORM FIRST-YEAR,
SEVEN GOLD COINS</b>

19:10.170 --> 19:13.420
<b>Humans are defined by a standard.</b>

19:14.040 --> 19:19.180
<b>Existences like you who disrupt
the entire system are not human.</b>

19:20.340 --> 19:26.310
<b>As long as I'm around, your existence
will never be acknowledged by this world.</b>

19:27.560 --> 19:29.440
<b>CLNCH CLNCH CLNCH</b>

19:29.520 --> 19:31.190
<b>"That's not necessarily true."</b>

19:31.350 --> 19:32.190
<b>"It's fine!"</b>

19:32.270 --> 19:33.690
<b>"You can do it if you try!"</b>

19:34.520 --> 19:35.440
<b>"Go for it."</b>

19:35.940 --> 19:42.620
<b>Thanks, Kevin, Tom, Mike, Kim,
Yamada, Koji, Satomi, Yukari.</b>

19:43.240 --> 19:45.030
<b>I'll do my best.</b>

19:48.580 --> 19:50.210
<b>I'll take you on then.</b>

19:54.630 --> 19:56.000
<b>With all I've got.</b>

19:59.260 --> 20:02.090
<b><i>Now, the last one to enter...</i></b>

20:02.470 --> 20:07.060
<b><i>Adler dorm, Mash Burnedead!</i></b>

20:07.600 --> 20:09.560
<b>Hey, that Mash guy...</b>

20:09.560 --> 20:12.020
<b>Isn't he the one who can't use magic?</b>

20:12.020 --> 20:16.570
<b>If that's true, him being
in the selection exam is unprecedented.</b>

20:16.900 --> 20:19.360
<b>This is no place for you!</b>

20:19.360 --> 20:20.570
<b>Go home!</b>

20:20.570 --> 20:22.320
<b>That's right, go home!</b>

20:22.450 --> 20:26.330
<b>Go home! Go home!</b>

20:26.410 --> 20:30.200
<b>Go home! Go home!</b>

20:30.290 --> 20:32.330
<b>Go home!</b>

20:32.580 --> 20:38.340
<b>Come on! Someone like him might ruin
the prestige of Divine Visionaries!</b>

20:38.750 --> 20:42.090
<b>What do you say about that, admins!?</b>

20:42.260 --> 20:44.760
<b>What a bunch of bullies.</b>

20:44.930 --> 20:49.100
<b>Mash earned the right
to be here by winning coins.</b>

20:49.890 --> 20:53.560
<b><i>His entire life is riding
on the results of this exam.</i></b>

20:53.690 --> 20:57.060
<b><i>Mash must be under incredible pressure.</i></b>

20:57.060 --> 20:58.690
<b><i>I should be encouraging.</i></b>

20:59.480 --> 21:02.360
<b>Mash, you don't have to worry...</b>

21:02.360 --> 21:05.610
<b>HONK</b>

21:04.200 --> 21:05.610
<b>I wanna go home.</b>

21:05.820 --> 21:07.700
<b>I don't blame you.</b>

<b><i>Adler, Lang, Orca.</i></b>

<b><i>All 12 candidates
from the three dorms are here!</i></b>

21:16.080 --> 21:18.460
<b><i>Let's get right to it then!</i></b>

21:18.460 --> 21:20.460
<b><i>Elimination's the name of the game!</i></b>

21:20.460 --> 21:23.090
<b><i>What better way to do that
than with a survival match!</i></b>

21:23.090 --> 21:27.140
<b><i>So we made a dead-or-alive
qualifying exam for you!</i></b>

21:28.300 --> 21:31.020
<b><i>It's called, "Deadervant's Haunt"!</i></b>

21:32.220 --> 21:33.480
<b><i>The rules are simple!</i></b>

21:33.480 --> 21:37.190
<b><i>Find a key hidden somewhere
in this stage and escape!</i></b>

21:37.190 --> 21:39.820
<b>Huh? That doesn't sound
as dangerous as I thought.</b>

21:39.820 --> 21:43.360
<b><i>But! The key is in the swim bladder
of a Troll-goosefish!</i></b>

21:43.360 --> 21:47.280
<b><i>You must use magic
to pop it like a balloon!</i></b>

21:48.570 --> 21:52.500
<b>That's really tough. I see.
So that's what this test's about.</b>

21:52.500 --> 21:53.950
<b><i>Furthermore...</i></b>

21:54.910 --> 21:58.460
<b><i>You'll be on the run
from three Deadervants all the while!</i></b>

21:58.460 --> 22:00.210
<b>WAIL</b>

22:00.750 --> 22:02.710
<b>Monsters!</b>

22:02.710 --> 22:04.090
<b><i>Yes, monsters.</i></b>
