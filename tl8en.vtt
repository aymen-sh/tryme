WEBVTT

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:27.669
Revelation 21.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.672
"And I saw a new heaven
and a new Earth."

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:33.134
"For the first heaven and the
first Earth were passed away."

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.139
"And I heard a great voice
out of heaven say, 'Behold..."

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:43.060
"'the tabernacle of God"

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.479
"'is with men."

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:50.068
"And God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes.'"

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:03.205
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:05.959
It's okay, it's okay.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.946
I've read this passage
too many times.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.686
Do you remember what comes next?

00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:31.984
"'And God will wipe away
all tears from their eyes..."

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:34.903
"'that there will be
no more death,"

00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:38.116
"'neither sorrow, nor crying,"

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:42.036
"'neither will there be
any more pain..."

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:45.030
"for the former things
are passed away.'"

00:02:45.955 --> 00:02:47.491
Do you know what that means?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.425
Good.

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:05.894
When can we bury him?

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:19.115
The ground is too cold to dig.

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:22.410
We'll bury your father
in the spring.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:27.040
Bless you... God bless you.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.376
We'll get through this, Joyce.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.186
How much do we have left?

00:03:49.878 --> 00:03:52.257
Venison... elk, rabbit.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.779
Keep the whole town
on rations...

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.199
maybe a week.

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:03.159
Two at best.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.374
Josiah and Martin think
they spotted some deer

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.893
the other night,
couple miles east.

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:15.087
It was dark.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:18.424
See what you
wanna see sometimes.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.010
Anyway.

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:26.557
James.

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:29.352
Yeah?

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.447
I sensed doubt in there.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.234
They haven't lost
faith in ya, David.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.360
They're just scared.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.071
Not from them.

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.080
I still believe.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.125
It's been a...

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:57.012
The last six months
have been hard.

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:58.631
For all of us.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.594
But I need to know
you're with me.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.473
Yeah.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:10.685
Good.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:15.106
Now go get our guns.
We're goin' huntin'.

00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:17.650
All right.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.335
You thirsty?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.422
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.895
No fucking way.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.500
Well, what do you think?

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.670
I don't see anybody.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.631
You think we can just take it?

00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:13.970
Yeah. Quickly. Whoever
shot it's probably nearby.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.558
Don't!

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.978
Drop your rifles!

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.356
Now!

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:35.115
Turn and face me... Slow.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.118
Any sudden moves, I put one
right between your eyes.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.288
Ditto for buddy boy.

00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:43.065
You're quite a hunter.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.582
We didn't even hear you coming.

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:46.793
Turn around and walk away.

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:48.503
- Okay.
- Just go!

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:51.101
Okay, all I ask is 10 seconds
of your time. I just wanna talk.

00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:52.173
I won't say it twice.

00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:53.675
Please. Just 10 seconds.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.135
My name is David.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.971
This is my friend, James.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.359
We're from a larger group...
women, children,

00:10:00.384 --> 00:10:02.458
and we're all...
very, very hungry.

00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:05.854
I'm from a large group, too.

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:08.815
Also hungry.

00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:12.320
Well, even so... ya can't
drag this back on your own.

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.071
We're not asking for charity.

00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:16.531
We-we can trade you

00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:17.741
for some of the deer. We have...

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.701
What do you need?
We have... boots.

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:21.245
Medicine?

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.581
Like, for infections.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.375
We do. Back in our village.

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:28.668
You're welcome to follow us.

00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:30.921
I'm not following you anywhere.

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:33.548
Buddy boy can go get it.

00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:35.625
He comes back,
you get half the deer.

00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:37.949
Anyone else shows
up, I put one...

00:10:37.974 --> 00:10:39.971
Put one right between my eyes.

00:10:40.972 --> 00:10:42.475
That's right.

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:47.562
All right, go talk to Howard.

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:50.231
He's got a case
with some penicillin.

00:10:50.232 --> 00:10:52.943
Bring back two bottles
and a syringe.

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:57.990
It's not code, James.
Do as I said.

00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:13.464
Ten steps back.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.969
Keep going.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.183
That's your dad's gun?

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:27.561
He the one that's sick?

00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:29.764
That's why you're
out here on your own?

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:33.408
Well, look, uh...

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:35.735
it's a four-mile round trip
back to our settlement.

00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:38.707
It's gonna be... a while
before James gets back.

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:40.689
I have some oil and
matches in my pack.

00:11:40.714 --> 00:11:42.951
We could... take shelter,

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.080
start a fire.

00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:52.294
Bring him with us.

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:53.838
Go.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.885
You know, you really shouldn't
be out here all on your own.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.722
From where I'm sitting, you
shouldn't be out here on your own.

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:22.074
Fair enough.

00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:25.327
So what's your name?

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.557
It's hard to trust strangers.
I know.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.700
But I honestly
mean you no harm.

00:12:34.044 --> 00:12:34.712
And for what it's worth,

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:36.880
there's room for you
in our group,

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.548
if you want.

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:40.800
You're inviting me to
your Hunger Club? Thanks.

00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:43.309
It's true. We're hungry,

00:12:43.334 --> 00:12:45.280
but... we're still here.

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:48.183
I'm a decent man

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.726
just tryna take care
of the people

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.411
who rely on me.

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:53.188
You're their leader?

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.440
Wasn't my choice. It was theirs.

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:56.567
But...

00:12:57.401 --> 00:12:58.776
yes.

00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:00.528
They "chose to follow you."

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:03.907
Is this some weird cult thing?

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:06.779
Uhh, well, you sorta
kinda got me there.

00:13:06.804 --> 00:13:07.994
I am a preacher,

00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:11.332
but just pretty
standard Bible stuff.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.875
- What?
- The whole world ended

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.343
and you still believe that shit.

00:13:15.344 --> 00:13:18.338
I actually started believing
after the world ended.

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:21.049
Before that, I was a teacher.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.218
Math. Taught kids about your age.

00:13:24.219 --> 00:13:27.931
So you went from teacher to preacher
because, what? It fuckin' rhymes?

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:29.767
Yeah, exactly.

00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:33.020
But seriously.

00:13:36.898 --> 00:13:40.360
Well, I found God...
after the Apocalypse,

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:43.189
which is either the best time
or the worst time to find Him,

00:13:43.214 --> 00:13:44.356
hard to say.

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:49.077
But when the Pittsburgh
QZ fell in '17,

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:50.788
Fireflies and FEDRA...

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:54.123
I left with a few others

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:57.335
and th-that's how
I ended up with our flock.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.248
Long way from Pittsburgh.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.634
Yeah, we'd settle somewhere,
and then raiders would come,

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.345
so we'd move again.

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:08.680
And as we wandered, we picked up

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:12.934
new people along
the way until...

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:13.935
we ended up here.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.771
Well, your luck had to
run out sooner or later.

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:18.298
Hm? Luck?

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.686
There's no such thing as luck.

00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:27.199
No, I-I-I-I believe everything
happens for a reason.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.660
It does.

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.328
It does. I can prove it to you.

00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:33.455
Okay.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.835
We didn't expect this
winter to be so cruel.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:42.172
Nothing'll grow.
Game's been hard to find.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.675
So I sent four of our
people to a nearby town

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:49.220
to-to scavenge what they could.

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:51.599
And only three of 'em came back.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.726
And the one that
didn't was a father.

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:57.437
He had a daughter just like you.

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.398
And her dad was taken from her.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.984
Turns out, he was murdered...

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.820
by this crazy man.

00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:07.114
And get this.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.741
That crazy man...

00:15:10.742 --> 00:15:12.252
was traveling
with a little girl.

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:17.033
You see?

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.960
Everything happens for a reason.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.921
James, lower the gun.

00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:27.436
She is the one that
killed Alec, isn't she?

00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:28.852
She didn't kill anybody.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:31.822
Lower the gun.

00:15:39.646 --> 00:15:41.281
Did you bring the medicine?

00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:43.942
- Yeah, but...
- Throw it to her.

00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:46.739
David.

00:15:56.496 --> 00:15:57.665
Back away.

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:03.294
I know you're not with a group.

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:05.246
You won't survive
for long out there.

00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:06.676
I can protect you.

00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:21.230
So you're just gonna
let her get away?

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.769
Ah, okay, the fuck
do I put this, Joel?

00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:02.937
Joel?

00:17:02.938 --> 00:17:05.190
Joel, where the
fuck do I put this?

00:17:07.024 --> 00:17:08.235
Fuck it.

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.907
Only five more left.

00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:50.712
What is it?

00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:53.090
Venison.

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:28.375
Big one.

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:44.557
If you've heard a rumor...

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:48.186
yes, we found a girl who was with
the man who took Alec from us.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.898
When the sun rises, I'll lead a
group out to pick up her trail.

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:55.276
Won't be hard
to find in the snow.

00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:57.987
We'll follow it to
wherever they're hiding...

00:19:57.988 --> 00:20:00.031
and we'll bring
that man to justice.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.742
You should kill him.

00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:04.202
You should kill both of them.

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:53.336
I know you think you don't
have a father anymore.

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:58.340
But the truth is, Hannah, you
will always have a father.

00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:01.386
And you will show him
respect when he's speaking.

00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:27.285
Thank you.

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:39.005
Lord, bless this food
and grant that we...

00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:41.215
May thankful for thy mercies be.

00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:43.718
To teach us to know
by whom we're fed,

00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:46.722
bless us with Christ,
the living bread.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:51.101
- Amen.
- Amen.

00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:14.535
Stay alert.

00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:17.680
If this man's not already
dead, he's dangerous.

00:24:17.981 --> 00:24:19.123
What about the girl?

00:24:20.424 --> 00:24:22.093
We bring her back with us.

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:27.548
I don't mean to question
your sense of mercy, David.

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:28.884
We can let her go.

00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:30.919
But we bring that girl
back with us,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.561
she's just another
mouth to feed.

00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:35.347
If we leave her out
here, she'll die.

00:24:36.348 --> 00:24:37.767
Yeah, but maybe
that's God's will.

00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:01.749
Joel! Joel, wake up.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.002
Joel, wake the fuck up, Joel.

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:17.556
Okay... okay, look at me.

00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:19.433
There are men coming, okay?

00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:21.143
I'm gonna lead them
away from you,

00:25:21.144 --> 00:25:22.603
but if anybody
makes it down here,

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:23.938
you fucking kill them.
You got it?

00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:26.649
Joel.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.610
Joel, do not fall asleep.

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:49.548
Come on.

00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:08.049
Hey, motherfuckers!

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:10.944
Shit!

00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:14.488
Go! Let's go.

00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:15.489
Alive!

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.672
Keep comin', fuckers!

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:42.434
I got her!

00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:04.914
Do it.

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:47.665
Two of you with me.
Drag the horse.

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:52.462
The rest of you, stay here.
Go door to door.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.174
You so hungry for vengeance?

00:27:57.258 --> 00:27:58.802
Deliver it.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.870
I started worrying
you wouldn't wake up.

00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:19.126
Let me out.

00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:21.554
Well, that's certainly the goal.

00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:23.630
Hungry?

00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:25.465
Why am I in a cage?

00:31:25.466 --> 00:31:27.342
Because I'm afraid of you.

00:31:27.343 --> 00:31:30.929
You're a dangerous person.
You've certainly proven that.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.330
The others, they want me to kill
you for all that's happened.

00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:40.355
Did you hear me say
the others wanna kill you?

00:31:40.356 --> 00:31:41.149
Yeah.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.385
- But I stopped them.
- Fuck you.

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:49.239
- Why don't we just start with your name?
- Eat shit.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.657
Hey, listen to me!

00:31:51.558 --> 00:31:53.285
You can't survive on your own.

00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:54.494
No one can.

00:31:55.495 --> 00:31:56.571
But I can help you.

00:31:57.372 --> 00:31:58.590
Let me protect you.

00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:01.210
I'm not on my own.

00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:04.090
Right. Your friend.

00:32:06.883 --> 00:32:07.925
And how is he?

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:14.098
I can see how much
you care about him

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:16.100
so I know it hurts.

00:32:17.226 --> 00:32:18.518
But even so...

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:21.439
you gotta face reality.

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:26.693
That part of your life,
it's ending.

00:32:26.694 --> 00:32:30.864
And what I'm offering you
is a beginning.

00:32:30.865 --> 00:32:33.451
But if you can't find
a way to trust me...

00:32:35.161 --> 00:32:37.288
then, yes, you are alone.

00:33:09.153 --> 00:33:10.905
Timothy?

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.763
Oh, shit.

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:35.930
Stop... stop. Please.

00:33:40.435 --> 00:33:42.520
- Leave him alone.
- You're next.

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:44.423
Please...

00:33:44.448 --> 00:33:45.539
I don't know any girl.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.943
- Oh, fuck!
- Jesus!

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:52.612
- Marco.
- No-no, no-no-no.

00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:55.240
He can't help you.
You focus right here.

00:33:55.241 --> 00:33:57.201
Or I'll pop your
fuckin' kneecap off.

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:02.832
She's alive.

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:04.551
Where?

00:34:06.252 --> 00:34:09.463
Ah, fuck! Fuck! Ah, the town!

00:34:09.564 --> 00:34:10.815
What town?!

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:13.009
Silver Lake.

00:34:18.848 --> 00:34:21.266
It's not a real town name.

00:34:21.267 --> 00:34:22.726
It's a resort.

00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:24.437
A resort?

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:36.657
You're gonna point
to where we are...

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.785
and where your "resort" is.

00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:42.329
And it better be the exact same
spot your buddy points to.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:44.707
Okay.

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:01.348
That's where we are.

00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:03.434
I swear.

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:07.145
Go ask him. He'll tell you.
I'm not lying.

00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:12.526
No... no!

00:35:13.527 --> 00:35:16.906
Shit! Jesus! No!

00:35:18.908 --> 00:35:20.687
Why the fuck did you do that?!

00:35:20.712 --> 00:35:22.627
He told you what you wanted!

00:35:25.832 --> 00:35:27.958
You motherfucker. Fuck you.

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:30.252
I ain't tellin' you shit.

00:35:30.253 --> 00:35:33.338
- It's okay... I believe him.
- No, no.

00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:36.217
No!

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:29.478
For what it's worth, this
is just deer meat. I swear.

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:33.983
You're gonna chop me up
into little pieces.

00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:37.153
I'd rather not.

00:36:38.154 --> 00:36:40.164
Please, just tell me your name.

00:36:43.284 --> 00:36:46.328
- If you wanna judge me...
- Judge you?

00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:49.582
You're eating people,
you sick fuck!

00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:58.132
Yes.

00:36:59.133 --> 00:37:01.218
There are only
a few of us that know.

00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:02.369
But I would've told you.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.055
Sooner or later. I guess sooner.

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:05.984
You're an animal.

00:37:06.009 --> 00:37:08.592
Well, yes, we all are.
That's sorta the point.

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:13.229
It was a last resort.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.898
You think it doesn't shame me?

00:37:15.899 --> 00:37:17.943
But what was I supposed to do?

00:37:17.944 --> 00:37:19.110
Let them starve?

00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:22.280
These people who put
their lives in my hands,

00:37:22.281 --> 00:37:25.284
who e-expect me to keep
them safe, who love me?

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:26.508
Yeah, maybe.

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.330
You don't believe that.

00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:31.749
I don't think
your friend would either.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.885
Didn't he take another
man's life to save yours?

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.603
He was defending himself.

00:37:37.004 --> 00:37:38.214
He was defending you.

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.760
But you knew that.

00:37:44.761 --> 00:37:46.012
You see a lot.

00:37:46.513 --> 00:37:47.680
So do I.

00:37:48.181 --> 00:37:50.434
And you know what I see
when I look at you?

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:54.438
Me.

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:57.190
You remind me of me.

00:37:57.191 --> 00:38:02.196
You're a natural leader,
you're smart... loyal.

00:38:04.073 --> 00:38:05.241
Violent.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.287
You don't know
anything about me.

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:12.914
But I do.

00:38:12.915 --> 00:38:15.250
If I let you out
of that cage right now,

00:38:15.251 --> 00:38:17.544
put that knife
of yours in your hand,

00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:19.846
you'd stick me in a second.

00:38:20.047 --> 00:38:22.215
You have a violent heart.

00:38:22.216 --> 00:38:24.135
And I should know.

00:38:28.848 --> 00:38:30.725
I've always had a violent heart.

00:38:33.019 --> 00:38:35.729
And I struggled
with it for a long time.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.482
But then the world ended
and I was shown the truth.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.818
Right... by God.

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.903
No.

00:38:43.904 --> 00:38:45.531
By Cordyceps.

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:48.450
What does Cordyceps do?
Is it evil?

00:38:48.451 --> 00:38:50.118
No.

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:53.162
It's fruitful. It multiplies.

00:38:53.163 --> 00:38:55.331
It feeds and protects
its children,

00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:59.086
and it secures its future
with violence, if it must.

00:39:02.672 --> 00:39:03.966
It loves.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.345
Why are you telling me
all of this?

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:10.430
Because you can handle it.

00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:13.100
The way the others can't.

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:17.354
They need God. They need heaven.

00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:18.481
They need...

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:21.901
they need a father.

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:24.652
You don't.

00:39:24.653 --> 00:39:25.664
You're beyond that.

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:29.991
I'm a shepherd
surrounded by sheep,

00:39:29.992 --> 00:39:31.652
and all I want...

00:39:33.245 --> 00:39:34.789
is an equal.

00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:38.459
A friend.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.562
What about my friend?

00:39:43.255 --> 00:39:44.941
Like I said, loyal.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.520
I can tell the others
to stop looking for him.

00:39:54.891 --> 00:39:56.185
They'll spare him.

00:39:57.353 --> 00:39:58.436
Really?

00:39:58.437 --> 00:40:00.063
They'll just let him go?

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:01.107
Yes.

00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:05.694
If he leaves us in peace,
they will just let him go.

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:08.781
They do what I tell them to do.

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:12.201
They follow me.

00:40:14.537 --> 00:40:16.622
And they would follow us.

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:20.543
Lord knows I could
use the help. I...

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:23.712
Look what's happened.

00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:31.720
Think of what we could do
together, as strong as we are.

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:35.224
We'd make this place perfect.

00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:38.269
We'd grow, spread out.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:42.565
And we'd do whatever
we needed for our people.

00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:47.153
Imagine the life
we could give them.

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:57.037
Imagine the life we could build.

00:41:21.103 --> 00:41:22.689
You little cunt.

00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:29.587
Let's see what I go
tell the others now.

00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:32.832
Ellie.

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:35.491
What?

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:38.411
Tell them that Ellie
is the little girl

00:41:38.412 --> 00:41:40.998
who broke your fucking finger!

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.284
How did you put it? Hmm?

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:45.713
"Tiny little pieces"?

00:43:39.073 --> 00:43:41.160
No! No! No!

00:43:42.161 --> 00:43:43.237
Get off of me!

00:43:43.838 --> 00:43:44.913
Get off!

00:43:50.502 --> 00:43:53.546
- Wait, wait!
- Shut up!

00:43:53.547 --> 00:43:55.798
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:57.550
Don't! Don't do it!
Please, don't do it!

00:43:57.551 --> 00:43:59.052
- Please, don't! Don't!
- You had your chance.

00:43:59.053 --> 00:44:01.055
I'm infected!

00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:04.099
I'm infected.

00:44:05.684 --> 00:44:08.812
And now so are you.

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:12.774
Roll up my sleeve.
Look at it. Look at it!

00:44:21.366 --> 00:44:22.408
What did you say?

00:44:23.409 --> 00:44:26.372
Everything happens
for a reason, right?

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:28.690
David.

00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:30.833
No.

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:33.294
No, she would've turned by now.
This isn't real.

00:44:33.795 --> 00:44:35.756
It looks pretty
fuckin' real to me.

00:45:39.402 --> 00:45:41.446
There's no way out, Ellie.

00:45:41.947 --> 00:45:45.492
The doors are locked.
And I have the keys.

00:45:48.704 --> 00:45:50.081
Ellie?

00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:52.792
Ellie!

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:00.090
Ellie...

00:46:01.591 --> 00:46:03.676
I know you're not infected.

00:46:03.677 --> 00:46:06.598
No one infected fights
this hard to stay alive.

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:13.770
So... how did you do it?

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.983
What's the secret?

00:46:18.484 --> 00:46:22.112
Or are you just
that fucking special?

00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:25.983
No one likes being
humiliated, Ellie.

00:46:27.075 --> 00:46:29.745
You don't know how good I am!

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:33.915
You don't know what
I could've given you!

00:46:34.416 --> 00:46:35.834
If you had just let me!

00:46:38.795 --> 00:46:40.623
Well, I have news for you.

00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:45.719
Neither one of us
is dying today.

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:50.306
You see, I've changed my mind.

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.059
I've decided you
do need a father.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.561
So I'm gonna keep you...

00:46:55.562 --> 00:46:57.105
and I'm gonna teach you.

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:00.861
Ellie.

00:47:06.198 --> 00:47:07.243
Ellie...

00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:15.749
Ah, fuck.

00:47:38.605 --> 00:47:41.274
I thought you already knew.

00:47:41.275 --> 00:47:43.286
The fighting is
the part I like the most.

00:47:45.279 --> 00:47:46.446
Don't be afraid.

00:47:47.447 --> 00:47:49.241
"There's no fear in love."

00:48:35.203 --> 00:48:37.080
No! Get off of me!

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:39.373
Get off!

00:48:39.374 --> 00:48:42.001
- It's me.
- Get...

00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:43.136
It's me.

00:48:44.337 --> 00:48:46.130
Hey... look.

00:48:46.131 --> 00:48:48.924
It's me... It's me.

00:48:49.676 --> 00:48:52.261
- It's okay.
- He...

00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:54.681
It's okay.

00:48:55.557 --> 00:48:57.558
It's okay, baby girl.

00:48:57.559 --> 00:48:58.728
I got you.

00:49:00.729 --> 00:49:01.855
I got you.

00:49:03.523 --> 00:49:04.858
Okay.
