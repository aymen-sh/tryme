00:04.310 --> 00:06.260
Yo, Xeno.

00:06.260 --> 00:07.920
I knew I'd find you here.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.340
Good news.

00:09.340 --> 00:12.590
The New World has its first guest.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.450
<i>Just like Senku-chan.</i>

00:19.340 --> 00:20.950
<i>No, not at all.</i>

00:20.950 --> 00:22.780
<i>He's a grown-up.</i>

00:25.210 --> 00:27.740
<i>He's seriously a professional...</i>

00:29.670 --> 00:31.130
<i>scientist.</i>

02:11.960 --> 02:16.010
What is that tall, slender bar?

02:16.410 --> 02:19.240
Damn, those guys are making something.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.540
Using science.

02:24.300 --> 02:28.660
I need to get as much info as I can on 
the enemy and inform Senku's team.

02:32.190 --> 02:33.420
Actually...

02:33.930 --> 02:35.440
Where's Gen?

02:35.440 --> 02:37.880
I guess he managed to infiltrate their base.

02:38.870 --> 02:42.820
Knowing that vapid man, 
he'll have managed to schmooze them.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.720
I doubt he's messed it up.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.720
He's the most trustworthy liar in the world.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.690
Blabbidy boo.

02:49.990 --> 02:53.690
Is he a liar or is he trustworthy? Which is it?

02:56.920 --> 02:59.500
<i>Do you hear me, </i>Perseus<i>?</i>

02:59.500 --> 03:01.890
<i>We just had a change of plans, and we need to—</i>

03:01.890 --> 03:04.240
You can stop right there.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.200
<i>Huh? Eh?</i>

03:08.200 --> 03:11.240
Right. We're on radio.

03:11.970 --> 03:13.860
The enemy are scientists, too.

03:14.210 --> 03:16.550
There's a good chance they're eavesdropping.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.620
That's true. They seemed to be one 
step ahead of us all the time.

03:22.020 --> 03:24.200
The enemy knows Japanese.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.310
At least, that should be our assumption.

03:26.770 --> 03:29.210
Tell us as simply as possible.

03:29.590 --> 03:30.700
What's the situation?

03:31.030 --> 03:33.310
Who's there with you?

03:34.420 --> 03:38.070
It's just me and Koha—a woman.

03:38.950 --> 03:42.310
A: Gen's been abducted by the enemy.

03:42.310 --> 03:45.480
B: Gen is infiltrating the enemy, 
pretending to have betrayed us.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.430
It's B.

03:47.430 --> 03:49.620
You can trust a sailor's instincts.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.340
Instincts have nothing to do with it.

03:53.340 --> 03:55.880
That's ten billion percent the case.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.000
Boop.

03:57.490 --> 03:58.750
You're hanging up already?!

03:59.240 --> 04:01.810
They'll figure out where the 
radio signal's coming from

04:01.810 --> 04:03.680
if we stay on the line too long.

04:03.680 --> 04:07.220
We don't know how advanced their science is.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.260
This is nothing like any 
of our previous battles.

04:11.980 --> 04:14.770
Science has always been our advantage.

04:14.770 --> 04:19.500
But this time, they might surpass us.

04:21.530 --> 04:24.360
So it's a hardcore battle between science users.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.280
This is exhilarating.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.420
Damn it.

04:36.260 --> 04:39.150
What the hell are you doing? 
Chrome, what are you, an idiot?

04:39.150 --> 04:40.940
Didn't I tell you not to ca—

04:41.570 --> 04:43.920
<i>Ah, hey there.</i>

04:45.090 --> 04:46.150
I see.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.390
So this is your frequency.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.980
This is how you stay in touch.

04:56.570 --> 05:00.650
<i>Nice to meet you, Youth Kingdom of Science.</i>

05:01.210 --> 05:03.280
<i>They made contact with us!</i>

05:06.910 --> 05:08.780
So you're the bad guy!

05:08.780 --> 05:10.910
I like your grit.

05:11.170 --> 05:13.580
I apologize for my poor Japanese,

05:13.580 --> 05:16.390
but this isn't something I can 
explain to any ordinary idiot.

05:17.420 --> 05:19.080
<i>I'm Doctor Xeno.</i>

05:19.080 --> 05:21.800
<i>I want to talk to your science leader.</i>

05:24.120 --> 05:26.800
Connect me to Doctor Taiju.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.270
Doctor Taiju?

05:36.800 --> 05:39.440
Uh-huh, that's Gen for you.

05:40.770 --> 05:43.860
He set up our toughest guy to be the decoy.

05:43.860 --> 05:46.530
He's supposed to be the 
science users' bodyguard.

05:46.530 --> 05:47.530
Makes sense.

05:47.530 --> 05:50.490
What?! I am?!

06:01.850 --> 06:04.880
In that case, I'll fight in our stead!

06:05.160 --> 06:06.740
Do we need the costume?

06:06.740 --> 06:07.980
Isn't it a voice call?

06:07.980 --> 06:10.010
It's always important to get in the spirit.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.470
Taiju here.

06:12.470 --> 06:14.070
Doctor Taiju.

06:14.380 --> 06:16.420
Doctor Xeno-san, was it?

06:16.420 --> 06:18.300
There's something I want to tell you!

06:18.300 --> 06:19.520
Listen up!

06:19.950 --> 06:24.650
Shooting people out of the blue 
with a machine gun is wrong!

06:25.540 --> 06:27.170
<i>Well, yeah.</i>

06:27.740 --> 06:31.850
Hey there. Sorry about my soldier, Stanley.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.080
I just wanted you to see...

06:35.370 --> 06:38.280
that you're no match for our science.

06:40.310 --> 06:44.330
Doctor Taiju, as a man of science, 
I'm sure you understand just as well

06:44.330 --> 06:45.800
what that means.

06:46.410 --> 06:50.590
We've already completed our Haber-Bosch plant.

06:50.590 --> 06:52.450
What?!

06:53.050 --> 06:56.390
H-Harvard what?

06:56.390 --> 06:58.150
Good work, Doctor Xeno!

06:58.150 --> 06:58.850
Impressive!

06:59.120 --> 07:01.960
<i>Quit running your mouth, damn it!</i>

07:01.960 --> 07:03.860
<i>You're gonna give away the game!</i>

07:03.860 --> 07:07.320
What's this Haber-whatsit?

07:07.740 --> 07:10.060
Haber-Bosch plant.

07:10.060 --> 07:12.070
An ammonia chemical factory.

07:12.710 --> 07:14.300
Simply put...

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Steel</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Water</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Air</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Coal</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Copper</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Nitric Acid</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Sulfur</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Charcoal</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Ammonia</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Platinum</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Corn</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Nitrocellulose</b>

07:14.120 --> 07:22.830
<b>Ammunition</b>

07:15.210 --> 07:20.180
It can create not just a ton, 
but limitless gunpowder—

07:20.180 --> 07:22.490
in other words, ammo.

07:23.680 --> 07:24.850
I see!

07:24.850 --> 07:28.170
In other words, you can use your 
machine gun as much as you like!

07:28.170 --> 07:30.090
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

07:30.630 --> 07:34.510
You're definitely quick 
to catch on, Doctor Taiju.

07:35.290 --> 07:37.640
<i>Made it sound like you already knew that!</i>

07:38.170 --> 07:40.870
Taiju-kun might be quite the actor.

07:40.870 --> 07:43.190
I think he's just a simpleton.

07:43.850 --> 07:46.470
We're a group of grown-up professionals.

07:46.470 --> 07:50.690
We aren't like you happy little boys.

07:50.980 --> 07:54.650
I want you to surrender without 
causing a fuss and work for us.

07:55.020 --> 07:56.740
That's all we ask.

07:56.740 --> 07:58.950
<i>We have a lack of manpower, you see.</i>

08:00.250 --> 08:02.420
What the hell is he talking about?

08:02.420 --> 08:03.900
Lack of manpower?

08:04.370 --> 08:08.000
There are plenty of statues lying 
around for him to revive.

08:09.610 --> 08:12.440
In other words, they don't 
know about the revival fluid.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.340
Am I right?

08:15.340 --> 08:20.350
That's one thing that doesn't quite fit 
in the framework of existing science.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.230
Those who maintained consciousness

08:23.230 --> 08:27.750
for the thousands of years after being 
petrified can be revived with nitric acid.

08:28.260 --> 08:31.780
We are the chosen ones who were 
able to accomplish just that.

08:33.300 --> 08:42.330
It seems implausible that the dozens 
of you kids are all such heroes.

08:43.310 --> 08:45.630
<i>How did you awaken the statues?</i>

08:46.560 --> 08:48.340
W-Well...

08:49.890 --> 08:53.160
The revival fluid is our only advantage.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.800
Don't hand it over to them.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.680
These people fired a machine gun at us on sight.

08:58.530 --> 09:01.310
They'll mow us down with a giant 
army the moment we tell them.

09:01.310 --> 09:07.650
Yeah, they have the capacity to make a 
shit ton as soon as they find our recipe.

09:08.310 --> 09:13.190
Nitric acid at the factory. Alcohol from corn.

09:13.480 --> 09:18.820
Which also means if we can grab that, 
we automatically have our Corn City.

09:19.350 --> 09:24.580
We get our billions of people's 
worth of revival fluid.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.110
We won't tell you about the revival fluid!

09:28.110 --> 09:29.710
Request denied!

09:31.820 --> 09:32.930
<i>I see.</i>

09:33.480 --> 09:35.620
<i>Then the negotiation has failed.</i>

09:36.580 --> 09:38.060
<i>How unfortunate.</i>

09:57.780 --> 09:59.630
<i>Th-There's trouble!</i>

09:59.630 --> 10:02.770
<i>That plane thing is coming back!</i>

10:13.030 --> 10:16.780
Wow, that's a pretty big sailboat.

10:17.090 --> 10:18.190
They've found us!

10:18.190 --> 10:19.970
The location of the <i>Perseus</i> and all!

10:19.970 --> 10:22.940
The enemy had more planes?!

10:22.940 --> 10:25.470
Why did you assume they'd only have one?

10:29.890 --> 10:31.760
It's a scout plane this time.

10:32.430 --> 10:38.460
Looks like we can't expect them to risk flying 
as low as they did for the river chase again.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.330
We can't reach them with 
our spears or bows, then!

10:43.690 --> 10:46.900
How are we going to fight 
against a plane, Senku?

10:48.290 --> 10:51.360
We have our own plane.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.340
The one they gifted us.

10:55.340 --> 10:57.640
I fixed it all up!

10:57.640 --> 11:01.750
How could I not get excited 
about this amazing machine?!

11:04.350 --> 11:06.790
But how are we going to take off?

11:07.170 --> 11:11.060
Unlike the enemy, we don't have a runway.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.980
That's why we're making one.

11:13.980 --> 11:15.520
Where?!

11:16.350 --> 11:17.570
Right here.

11:19.010 --> 11:21.200
We're making a carrier!

11:21.500 --> 11:25.200
Operation "Mod the <i>Perseus</i>" begins!

11:31.570 --> 11:33.520
Here we go!

11:35.940 --> 11:37.990
A-An aircraft carrier?

11:46.860 --> 11:50.930
All right! Let's get a handle on the situation.

11:53.690 --> 11:57.430
Here we go again with squeaky-clean Magma.

11:57.430 --> 12:00.260
He's talking way too properly, too. It's weird.

12:00.260 --> 12:03.700
Eat it. Shut up and listen, or I'll kill you.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.380
You're right back to your 
normal self in five seconds!

12:06.380 --> 12:08.200
You could have tried a bit harder!

12:08.560 --> 12:12.580
I'll beat the shit out of that Doctor Xeno dude!

12:13.090 --> 12:15.640
We're here for corn!

12:15.640 --> 12:18.740
And that guy has it, doesn't he?

12:18.740 --> 12:21.440
Let's finish the job!

12:21.440 --> 12:24.430
<b>Off</b>

12:22.060 --> 12:24.040
You mean finish off Xeno?!

12:24.750 --> 12:28.680
What I want right now, Yo, 
is that gun on your waist.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.420
He hasn't just lost his mind!

12:34.420 --> 12:37.420
This is a proper plan!

12:37.420 --> 12:39.820
We can just whack him ourselves...

12:40.130 --> 12:46.050
And we'll be remembered for 
generations as heroes and saviors!

12:45.510 --> 12:47.820
<b>Heroes</b>

12:53.240 --> 12:55.960
Time to go hunt down Xeno!

12:58.540 --> 12:59.940
No way...

13:11.100 --> 13:16.060
What kind of idiot thinks it's a good 
idea to charge into a machine gun?!

13:16.310 --> 13:18.480
We've got our own gun!

13:18.480 --> 13:21.810
They have ten billion orders of 
magnitude more firepower than you.

13:21.810 --> 13:24.650
Although, if they have the 
patience to wait for us

13:24.650 --> 13:28.200
to build our own gunpowder 
factory, then sure, maybe.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.250
Let's get a handle on the situation.

13:36.380 --> 13:40.610
<i>It's the same line as Magma's, 
and yet it's so much more trustworthy!</i>

13:50.130 --> 13:52.610
It looks like a board game!

13:52.610 --> 13:54.860
Are we playing a game now?

13:55.640 --> 13:56.890
<b>Kohaku</b>

13:55.640 --> 13:56.890
<b>Xeno</b>

13:55.640 --> 13:56.890
<b>me</b>

13:56.890 --> 13:58.140
<b>Gen</b>

13:58.410 --> 13:59.800
A strategy meeting.

13:59.800 --> 14:00.590
Yeah.

14:00.970 --> 14:04.570
Let's first clarify where we and the enemy are.

14:05.570 --> 14:09.360
Right now, we're here.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.680
Do we know the enemy position?

14:14.680 --> 14:15.460
Yeah.

14:16.220 --> 14:21.960
I'd say we have their rough distance based 
on the angle and timing of Chrome's signal.

14:24.050 --> 14:25.760
They're around here somewhere.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.090
Which means the enemy is right near by.

14:30.410 --> 14:32.010
Incredibly clear.

14:32.010 --> 14:36.050
B-But they know where we are, too, right?

14:36.050 --> 14:39.440
Don't you think we should 
take the <i>Perseus</i> and flee?

14:39.780 --> 14:42.080
As long as they have patrol 
planes, there's no point.

14:42.580 --> 14:46.650
If anything, we'll lose our ability to 
run to land as soon as we retreat to sea.

14:46.650 --> 14:48.020
I know, right?

14:48.020 --> 14:50.030
That's what I was actually thinking, too.

14:50.390 --> 14:56.040
Hyoga, what would you do if you 
were the enemy, Doctor Xeno?

14:56.800 --> 14:59.290
I'd make a pirate ship.

15:02.010 --> 15:05.000
Assuming the enemy is proper, that is.

15:05.290 --> 15:07.460
I would not be contested in firepower,

15:07.460 --> 15:12.340
so I would approach in a small 
high-speed boat and quickly take over.

15:15.410 --> 15:18.520
A large ship would have no chance to escape.

15:18.830 --> 15:23.180
The same tactic as modern pirates.

15:25.820 --> 15:30.820
The scout plane has determined 
exactly where our <i>Perseus</i> is.

15:31.170 --> 15:33.110
I'd also attack from the sky.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.250
No matter how capable we may 
be in close-quarters combat,

15:42.510 --> 15:44.180
we can't fly.

15:47.420 --> 15:50.720
They have absolute air 
superiority in this battle.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.550
We aren't going to win.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.530
Precisely!

15:55.530 --> 16:00.020
In other words, to combat a plane, 
we need a dogfight!

16:00.370 --> 16:01.950
An aerial duel!

16:04.380 --> 16:06.560
A d-dogfight?!

16:06.780 --> 16:09.850
And to that end...

16:22.040 --> 16:25.580
We're making the <i>Perseus</i> carrier!

16:26.490 --> 16:29.350
All hands, get this thing built ASAP!

16:54.990 --> 16:56.420
Wow...

16:56.420 --> 16:59.330
They're really building a runway on the deck.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.460
Will we really be able to take off from here?

17:04.400 --> 17:09.280
An ultralight plane only needs 
20 meters to take off.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.360
Yup.

17:10.360 --> 17:13.780
And for the landing, we'll grab it with a wire.

17:13.780 --> 17:16.180
Just like a real aircraft carrier.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.080
More than enough!

17:18.080 --> 17:20.410
Who do you think the pilot's gonna be?

17:20.410 --> 17:22.910
We're modding the plane itself, too.

17:22.910 --> 17:25.940
It'll be stupid fast compared 
to building it from scratch.

17:25.940 --> 17:27.370
Seriously, your eyes!

17:27.370 --> 17:29.490
It only took you five seconds 
to lose your poker face!

17:29.490 --> 17:32.340
You were just looking for an excuse 
to build a carrier, weren't you?!

17:36.890 --> 17:39.650
Since we're driving the plane on wood planks,

17:39.650 --> 17:43.220
we're starting by switching 
to good ol' bamboo wheels.

17:43.220 --> 17:44.650
Got it!

17:46.870 --> 17:50.000
You brought all that bamboo from Japan?

17:50.290 --> 17:51.260
Yeah.

17:51.260 --> 17:56.510
Bamboo is the one OP material 
advantage that we have over them.

17:56.970 --> 17:58.210
That's right.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.010
There's no bamboo in the US.

18:01.850 --> 18:06.770
So that's why they use these 
glass skis instead of wheels.

18:06.770 --> 18:13.280
Skis give them a chance to <i>maybe</i> land 
outside their runway in the corn fields.

18:14.690 --> 18:16.320
They've thought this through.

18:16.610 --> 18:21.030
They took their lack of materials 
as an opportunity to add more.

18:22.970 --> 18:25.290
Our enemy is pretty clever—

18:26.690 --> 18:28.160
this Doctor Xeno!

18:33.880 --> 18:35.630
What's wrong, Ryusui?

18:35.630 --> 18:36.450
Well...

18:36.770 --> 18:43.670
Assuming Doctor Xeno is so clever, as a pilot, 
I recognize that scout plane's flight pattern.

18:43.670 --> 18:47.810
It was intimidating us, 
letting us know there's nowhere to hide.

18:48.040 --> 18:52.050
That or they're trying to pin us down here.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.300
You can always trust a sailor's instincts!

19:02.000 --> 19:03.950
They won't be escaping.

19:05.340 --> 19:08.160
The scout plane made sure of that.

19:21.190 --> 19:26.560
So you hunted them down with the plane 
so you could suppress them by force?

19:26.930 --> 19:34.940
The smarter the kids are, 
the more they'll be petrified in fear of that.

19:35.330 --> 19:40.700
But I think we should take a 
slightly more elegant approach.

19:43.610 --> 19:47.990
We'll pin them down and 
assassinate the enemy scientist.

19:48.290 --> 19:51.250
A-A-Assassinate?!

19:51.250 --> 19:56.790
According to that gentleman, Mr. Gen, 
there's only one OP scientist.

19:57.290 --> 20:01.920
In other words, in order to bring 
down the Youth Kingdom of Science...

20:03.150 --> 20:06.550
we need only to erase their leader,

20:10.360 --> 20:12.520
Doctor Taiju.

20:14.770 --> 20:17.730
That's a legit good idea!

20:17.730 --> 20:20.440
B-B-But can you really pull that off?

20:26.630 --> 20:27.970
We can.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.750
How?

20:34.180 --> 20:35.480
I can.

20:37.120 --> 20:44.590
Oh, Mr. Gen, if Stan says he can do it, 
you have no reason to ask him anything else.

20:46.050 --> 20:48.140
It can be done.

20:49.520 --> 20:54.140
<i>I'm so sorry, Taiju-chan.</i>

20:54.970 --> 20:57.440
Gen-kun, Chrome-kun, Kohaku-kun...

20:57.820 --> 21:00.370
Abandon all of that and forfeit the corn,

21:00.370 --> 21:03.280
and we'll be saved should we 
escape into the open seas.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.860
No way we'd ever do that!

21:05.860 --> 21:07.470
I figured as much.

21:07.470 --> 21:10.160
But the enemy doesn't know that.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.920
That's our situation.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.420
So they should be attacking us soon.

21:17.200 --> 21:22.880
In that case, why not save them 
the trouble and strike them first?

21:24.240 --> 21:31.430
We'll send a special squad to capture 
the enemy's science source, Doctor Xeno.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.220
On the team will be...

21:35.050 --> 21:39.910
Tsukasa, Hyoga, Ukyo, and...

21:41.280 --> 21:42.430
Suika.

21:45.140 --> 21:47.990
<i>Neither side can move its base.</i>

21:48.280 --> 21:49.960
<i>Nowhere to run.</i>

21:49.960 --> 21:51.560
<i>Barricaded by science.</i>

21:51.940 --> 21:54.550
<i>This is a real fistfight, isn't it?</i>

21:54.550 --> 21:56.250
<i>There's a chance...</i>

21:57.450 --> 22:02.000
<i>that both sides have each other in check.</i>

22:06.860 --> 22:10.040
<i>It's a Kingdom of Science versus
a Kingdom of Science</i>

22:11.760 --> 22:13.580
<i>standoff!</i>
