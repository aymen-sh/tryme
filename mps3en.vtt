00:00:20.817 --> 00:00:22.257
I know.

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:26.487
How ridiculous it sounds
that I need to do something

00:00:26.487 --> 00:00:29.627
in the time I was
suddenly fallen into, but...

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.588
But...

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:40.917
Let's go out.

00:00:52.407 --> 00:00:55.367
It's chillier in here than outside.

00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:02.155

we'll be returning tonight.

Come out after you change.

Even in the same class.

00:02:08.435 --> 00:02:11.495
What about the novel?
What exactly happened?

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:16.225
No one else really likes me.

00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:18.085
That's why...

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:22.035
That's why...

I want to die.

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:33.255
I never imagined my mom
had a time like that in her life.

00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:35.805
But was there more?

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:38.695
My mom's other moments
that I didn't know about.

00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:42.825
There was a time I dreamed
of becoming a novelist.

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:44.825
What's the story about?

00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:48.445
Can you give me an autographed copy too?

00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:49.735
You're going to read it?

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.905
That's okay.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:56.655
How much of my mom's life have I missed?

00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:12.045
No.

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:15.085

I don't think I can go back just yet.

What do you plan to do there?

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:03.335
Do you remember these people?

00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:07.195
May 14th and 16th, 1987.

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:11.205
The two women who died one after another.

00:04:11.205 --> 00:04:16.215
And the woman who disappeared on
the 20th and hasn't been found to this day.

00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:21.255
Yes, they were all women I knew or
had seen around the neighborhood.

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:23.775
And you never killed them?

00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:25.765
I really didn't!

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:29.415
If only those damn investigators
didn't frame me back then.

00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:33.025
I feel wronged.

00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:35.125
Please believe me.

Yes. And this...

00:04:40.585 --> 00:04:44.185
is the list of prime suspects at the time.

Including you, there are
a total of three people.

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:50.375
Do you remember the other two men?

00:04:51.365 --> 00:04:55.045
Yes. Since our town is so small.

00:04:56.255 --> 00:05:00.675
Then from now on, tell me
everything you remember about

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.225
these six people, including yourself.

00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:05.875
Even very trivial things are fine.

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:11.605
My memories are from so long ago
that I'm not sure how accurate it will be.

00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:14.075
It's just for reference, so don't worry.

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:16.975
I'll go directly to the sites
to check for accuracy.

00:05:18.465 --> 00:05:22.995
This is a case without much
remaining information or evidence.

00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:27.465
That's why I'll be getting
as close to them as possible,

00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:30.345
and watching their every move.

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:34.275

faces and unfamiliar ways of speaking.

Like they came from a different world.

Yes, an unfamiliar face
and a different world.

don't know this place,

and year it is right now.

- Right.

Oh, right. I'm sure you did.
I guess you do every day.

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:22.995

I have good eyesight.

Who's that?

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:28.665
I asked who it was, you punk.

Do you think you're making
sense right now? School?

00:07:33.115 --> 00:07:36.715
Not even as a teacher but as a student?

00:07:36.715 --> 00:07:38.785
Is that something so shocking?

00:07:38.785 --> 00:07:41.265
To the point of not knowing
how hot something is?

00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:43.805
Ow!

00:07:47.965 --> 00:07:52.345
Well, I'm sure you'll
see what I mean, but...

00:07:52.345 --> 00:07:56.565
if I remove my makeup,
you can't really tell my age.

00:07:56.565 --> 00:08:00.445
So I can easily look three years younger.

00:08:02.475 --> 00:08:05.135
I don't think that is likely convincing.

00:08:38.675 --> 00:08:39.965
Give me that hand.

00:08:39.965 --> 00:08:43.175
Don't you think the order is wrong?

00:08:43.175 --> 00:08:46.465
There's no order. You can
just apply whichever hand first.

00:08:52.725 --> 00:08:55.115
You're not talking about that.

00:08:55.115 --> 00:08:58.825
Is it because of what you need to do here?

00:09:00.565 --> 00:09:04.365
Then you need to explain that to me first.

00:09:18.685 --> 00:09:21.235

You forgot to explain what's going on.

00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:30.075
Do you think that's necessary right now?

00:10:31.185 --> 00:10:34.505
You should at least try
calling Chairman Lee.

Are you relying on
Chairman Lee to save you?

00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:03.075
I understand you're desperate for this
case due to your performance record.

00:12:03.075 --> 00:12:05.415

status, and I can prove it.

00:12:11.425 --> 00:12:14.755
If you want, I can prove it to you.

00:12:20.455 --> 00:12:23.625
You're saying she has a clear identity?

00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:24.865
Yes.

00:12:25.865 --> 00:12:27.825
She's...

00:12:32.565 --> 00:12:34.375
She's...

00:12:37.495 --> 00:12:41.475

Oh, look at her!

- Hi!
- How's it going?

00:13:42.715 --> 00:13:43.945
When was I born?

I'm really sorry, but...

00:13:57.415 --> 00:14:00.885
what was my resident ID number after 63?

00:14:03.835 --> 00:14:05.305
Wait, time out.

00:14:05.305 --> 00:14:06.695
Come here.

00:14:06.695 --> 00:14:08.925
Why, why? We are almost at
school! Where are we going? Why?

00:14:08.925 --> 00:14:12.025
- Just come here for a second.
- Why?

00:14:17.805 --> 00:14:19.255
Why here?

00:14:19.255 --> 00:14:23.425
You do realize how
dangerous this situation is, right?

00:14:23.425 --> 00:14:27.385
If anything goes wrong, either
of us will see an ambiguous end.

00:14:27.385 --> 00:14:28.865
I know.

00:14:28.865 --> 00:14:30.715
I felt it yesterday.

00:14:30.715 --> 00:14:32.635
I'm going to school, so nothing goes wrong.

00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:34.195
You should say what's actually happening.

00:14:34.195 --> 00:14:36.955
You're going there for your own plan.

00:14:36.955 --> 00:14:40.595
Considering the critical nature,
I admit I totally lucked out.

00:14:40.595 --> 00:14:45.175
"Totally lucked out." You need to
watch how you say stuff like that!

00:14:47.235 --> 00:14:50.445
All right. I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

00:14:50.445 --> 00:14:52.695
It's my first time to
time travel, that's why.

00:14:52.695 --> 00:14:54.365
That's what I mean.

00:14:54.365 --> 00:14:57.645
Why go to school when you're
time-traveling for the first time?

00:15:02.825 --> 00:15:05.595
I have my reasons. Like you do.

00:15:07.655 --> 00:15:09.875
You didn't think I knew?

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:12.795
For someone who can time travel freely,

00:15:12.795 --> 00:15:15.225
why would he settle down
in a house in another time

00:15:15.225 --> 00:15:19.265
and pretend to be a teacher
with a daily commute?

00:15:19.265 --> 00:15:21.195
The daily commute is...

00:15:23.865 --> 00:15:26.685
terrible even in the present life.

00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:33.795
Well, I'm sure there
are personal reasons for

00:15:33.795 --> 00:15:36.865
telling such serious and dangerous lies.

00:15:38.045 --> 00:15:41.105
But I won't ask what they are.

00:15:41.995 --> 00:15:45.475
So you mean, "Don't ask me mine if
you won't tell me your reason," right?

00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:47.825
Correct.

00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:51.735
Let's just do what we need to do.

00:15:51.735 --> 00:15:56.235
And I won't try to put you in a
difficult situation like last night.

00:15:57.565 --> 00:16:01.535
At least until we return,
we are in the same boat.

00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:03.405
You're only going to school.

00:16:03.405 --> 00:16:05.705
As soon as school is
over, you go straight home.

00:16:05.705 --> 00:16:08.165
Try your best not to
stand out and stay quiet.

00:16:08.165 --> 00:16:12.325
If you disrupt anything I
do, school is over for you.

00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:14.125
At any given time.

00:16:15.055 --> 00:16:16.385
Agreed.

00:16:18.405 --> 00:16:21.765
But do you think that
detective will come by again?

00:16:22.695 --> 00:16:24.175
Not sure.

00:16:25.535 --> 00:16:27.855
Shall we go for now?

00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:29.495
Let's go.

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:47.225
Oh, right, right.

00:16:47.225 --> 00:16:49.535
Oh, don't worry about things like that.

00:16:49.535 --> 00:16:51.605
Don't worry.

00:16:51.605 --> 00:16:55.685
That could happen when
young people work together.

00:16:55.685 --> 00:16:59.925
Just bring me a bottle of makgeolli later.

00:16:59.925 --> 00:17:03.795
You should think of your lonely
friend whose son lives far away, man.

00:17:03.795 --> 00:17:05.245
All right.

00:17:05.245 --> 00:17:08.055
Bye, Chief Kim.

00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:10.185
Aigoo! Sorry, sorry.

00:17:10.185 --> 00:17:13.335
My phone call took
a little long, didn't it?

00:17:13.335 --> 00:17:14.855
All right.

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:18.905
I'm really happy today.

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:21.645
We have our first transfer students
since the school was established.

00:17:21.645 --> 00:17:25.535
What's more, two of them on the same day!

00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:28.175
They even slightly look alike.

00:17:28.175 --> 00:17:30.685
- No way!
- We do not look alike!

00:17:36.957 --> 00:17:41.485
You may have met at the club some
time ago, but make a formal introduction.

00:17:41.485 --> 00:17:43.775
This is Mr. Yoon.

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.925
Also, if you look carefully-

00:17:46.925 --> 00:17:49.065
No, we don't look alike.

00:17:53.915 --> 00:17:59.755
Anyway, he will be your nephew's
teacher from today onward.

00:18:00.925 --> 00:18:03.295
Dad is his nephew?

00:18:05.015 --> 00:18:06.435
Then I'm also related to...

00:18:06.435 --> 00:18:08.355
Please take good care of him.

00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:11.625
Detective Baek Dong
Shik is a very capable man.

00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:15.595
Thanks to men like him, our town
became such a great place to live.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:18.035
We need to always be grateful.

00:18:18.995 --> 00:18:22.075
I should be the one asking
you to take good care of us.

00:18:24.972 --> 00:18:29.565
Why did such a capable
person act that way last night?

00:18:29.565 --> 00:18:33.075
Oh, I'm sorry, Chairman Lee.

00:18:33.075 --> 00:18:36.155
That's fine. I'm sure you
didn't know we are family.

00:18:36.155 --> 00:18:38.795
He's the teacher, and you're the parent.

00:18:38.795 --> 00:18:41.555
So we are all Woojung High School family.

00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:44.085
So from now on, let's all
get along nicely. All right?

00:18:44.085 --> 00:18:45.975
Second skull!

00:18:49.845 --> 00:18:53.045
Wow, we are all meeting
here with the first skull too!

00:18:53.045 --> 00:18:55.008
This is so amazing!

00:18:55.008 --> 00:18:59.118
Dad, the two skulls at the same time...

00:19:05.171 --> 00:19:09.191
So it seems like you
don't have a father, either.

00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:17.201
Don't talk to me.

00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:21.991
I mean, as a transfer student,

00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:25.121
if you came to school
with your uncle-in-law,

00:19:25.121 --> 00:19:27.271
it's totally obvious.

00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:35.501
Some fathers don't even
show up even if they're around.

00:19:36.401 --> 00:19:39.361
Throughout elementary,
middle, and high school...

00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:43.901
A father who never came to the entrance
ceremony, graduation, or sports events.

00:19:43.901 --> 00:19:46.211
Get into fights while drunk,

00:19:46.211 --> 00:19:50.331
he missed all the
important events in my life.

00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:53.451
My dad was that kind of person.

00:19:53.451 --> 00:19:55.981
What kind of dad is that?

00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:57.371
Wow.

00:19:58.311 --> 00:20:01.741
It's so weird hearing that
come out of your mouth.

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:08.571
Hey, but what is elementary school?

00:20:08.571 --> 00:20:10.291
Grade school.

00:20:11.241 --> 00:20:12.831
Oh, that's what it's called!

00:20:12.831 --> 00:20:15.071
E-Elementary grade school.

00:20:17.101 --> 00:20:21.261
Hey, if you're here,

00:20:21.261 --> 00:20:23.681
is Soon Ae also...

00:20:24.651 --> 00:20:25.931
Hey!

00:20:26.991 --> 00:20:29.791
- I told you yesterday, right? Stop showing interest!
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:20:31.241 --> 00:20:33.381
Hey, hey, hey, I told you yesterday too!

00:20:33.381 --> 00:20:35.101
To mind your own business!

00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:37.241
Ow, ow, ow!

00:20:37.241 --> 00:20:39.831
Hey, you girl, let go!

00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:48.341
Didn't you say your niece-in-law

00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:51.001
was mild-mannered?

00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:56.711
Oh, she said she would be.

00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:00.381
- You know that, right?
- No, really.

00:21:00.381 --> 00:21:02.291
- Wow!
- Is that it?

00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:04.431
- Hey, look at this!
- I dropped this.

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:07.651
- Oh, here it is.
- That's right!

00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:24.081
- Oh, my gosh!
- My hand!

00:21:24.081 --> 00:21:25.621
Are you okay?

00:21:25.621 --> 00:21:27.121
Aigoo.

00:21:38.101 --> 00:21:39.621
Class President.

00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:42.041
Attention!

00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:43.671
Bow!

00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:45.401
Hello.

00:21:45.401 --> 00:21:47.041
Come in.

00:21:57.661 --> 00:22:02.201
This is Baek Yoon Young, who will
be joining our class from today onward.

00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:04.621
She took some time off from
school due to family matters.

00:22:04.621 --> 00:22:05.921
She's unni to you guys.

00:22:05.921 --> 00:22:08.441
There's no such a thing as unni.

00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:10.941
We are all friends if
we're in the same class.

00:22:10.941 --> 00:22:13.231
That's right.

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:16.181
Well, you girls can
decide that on your own...

00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:17.961
Wait, no.

00:22:17.961 --> 00:22:20.851
Kim Hae Gyeong, Lee Eun Ha, Park Yoo Ri.

00:22:20.851 --> 00:22:23.981
Kim-Lee-Park trio, act accordingly.

00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:27.691
You better not get caught
mistreating our transfer student!

00:22:27.691 --> 00:22:29.561
- Yes.
- Geez...

00:22:29.561 --> 00:22:31.861
You're 12th graders

00:22:31.861 --> 00:22:33.921
with no hope.

00:22:33.921 --> 00:22:35.471
Oh, geez.

00:22:35.471 --> 00:22:37.571
Except for our Lee Soon Ae.

00:22:42.601 --> 00:22:44.991
There's an empty seat there. Go sit there.

00:22:45.891 --> 00:22:47.201
Yes.

00:22:48.402 --> 00:22:49.731
That's it for now!

00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:52.641
Thank you.

00:23:03.061 --> 00:23:06.011
- Hey, come here!
- That punk!

00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:24.251
Sit down.

00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:27.351
Everyone, this is our new transfer student.

00:23:27.351 --> 00:23:29.451
Introduce yourself freely.

00:23:37.431 --> 00:23:39.141
I'm Baek Hee Seop.

00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:48.061
What?

00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:50.421
- That's it?
- Yes.

00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:54.371
To say a lot would be

00:23:54.371 --> 00:23:58.591
going against the rock and roll spirit.

00:24:08.591 --> 00:24:09.851
Right.

00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:12.911
I see that's your concept.

00:24:12.911 --> 00:24:14.781
We can't violate that.

00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:16.391
Go sit wherever you want.

00:24:16.391 --> 00:24:18.381
That's it for now.

00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:20.171
Goodbye.

00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:23.281
Goodbye.

00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:31.391
What happened?

00:24:33.841 --> 00:24:37.111
I just thought I would
stay here a while longer.

00:24:37.111 --> 00:24:38.831
Are you happy to see me?

00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:45.021
You like Virginia Woolf?

00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:46.671
Can I see?

00:24:54.631 --> 00:24:56.491
Do you know this book?

00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:05.011
"If you could give her 100 years,

00:25:05.011 --> 00:25:10.381
if you could give her a room
of her own and 500 pounds,

00:25:10.381 --> 00:25:13.351
if you let her speak her mind, and

00:25:13.351 --> 00:25:17.751
if she could earn half of
what she already wrote

00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:21.801
she concluded she
could write a better book."

00:25:23.261 --> 00:25:26.561
"If you gave her another
100 years, she would

00:25:26.561 --> 00:25:28.971
become a poet."

00:25:32.051 --> 00:25:35.331
Shit, what the hell!

00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:47.471
Hey, good to see you.

00:26:13.721 --> 00:26:16.371
You really play the guitar well!

00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:18.071
You can hear this?

00:26:18.071 --> 00:26:19.811
You put it in the fourth
tier of the selector and

00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:22.671
played the rhythm with the E9 chord!

00:26:22.671 --> 00:26:26.731
Wow! Your fingers are fast,
and you've got a good rhythm.

00:26:26.731 --> 00:26:29.261
I can't believe I finally met my mate!

00:26:30.721 --> 00:26:32.541
Nice to meet you!

00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:35.391
I'm Yoo Beom Ryong.

00:26:36.771 --> 00:26:39.001
Look at this crazy guy.

00:26:41.838 --> 00:26:43.201
Nice to meet you!

00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:44.471
Hey.

00:26:44.471 --> 00:26:47.214
When someone says, "Good to see you,"

00:26:47.214 --> 00:26:49.534
shouldn't you respond to that?

00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:53.851
That's such a childish way,

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:58.941
but since you guys are childish.

00:27:10.221 --> 00:27:12.211
But what's that?

00:27:23.421 --> 00:27:26.221
I wonder if she's using it well.

00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:27.481
Follow me.

00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:28.851
Yes.

00:27:34.711 --> 00:27:36.661
Come here.

00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:38.991
Oh, man. She's bothering me.

00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:40.781
Teacher!

00:27:43.091 --> 00:27:46.731
Wait a moment. Just a second.

00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:02.411
Why are you acting
friendly? You want to die?

00:28:06.461 --> 00:28:09.081
I don't have much time, so just listen.

00:28:09.081 --> 00:28:12.731
All right, look into the opponent's eyes

00:28:13.701 --> 00:28:15.451
like this.

00:28:18.951 --> 00:28:20.971
You're doing well!

00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:24.621
And then say, "What's that?"

00:28:26.391 --> 00:28:27.951
That's what you do.

00:28:27.951 --> 00:28:30.011
Then they would look down, right?

00:28:30.011 --> 00:28:33.271
That's when you quickly crouch down.

00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:35.551
And hit them like this!

00:28:35.551 --> 00:28:38.531
At that time, their nose will bleed and...

00:28:45.861 --> 00:28:49.871
Hey, this won't work for you. Okay,
just pretend like you're doing that to me.

00:28:49.871 --> 00:28:52.251
So I just look down like this.

00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:55.531
F***!

00:28:55.531 --> 00:28:58.061
Is your skull made of rock or something?

00:29:02.051 --> 00:29:05.691
So what the heck is this?

00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:10.051
Shit.

00:29:12.971 --> 00:29:16.891
My dad taught me this.

00:29:18.671 --> 00:29:22.651
When I entered elementary school,
he said if another kid picked on me,

00:29:22.651 --> 00:29:25.541
I should get a head start like this.

00:29:25.541 --> 00:29:28.391
When I graduated, both of
my parents had passed away.

00:29:28.391 --> 00:29:31.401
But this is the one thing I learned and

00:29:31.401 --> 00:29:34.541
I have been using it very well.

00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:41.121
This is what dads want to teach their kids.

00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:44.071
So...

00:29:44.071 --> 00:29:47.041
it's not like your dad missed
it because he wanted to.

00:29:47.041 --> 00:29:49.241
He probably had his reasons.

00:29:55.641 --> 00:29:58.051
- What do you know?
- What?

00:29:59.431 --> 00:30:02.821
That's so childish as a 19-year-old.

00:30:02.821 --> 00:30:04.991
I don't need anything like that.

00:30:12.891 --> 00:30:14.791
Oh, geez.

00:30:14.791 --> 00:30:16.661
Oh, oh, are you okay?

00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:18.851
Oh, my gosh, you're bleeding!

00:30:18.851 --> 00:30:20.771
- Oh!
- Geez.

00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:25.191
Shit.

00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:29.371
- Are you crazy?
- Could you guys please be quiet?

00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:34.831
It's hard to focus on my reading.

00:30:40.881 --> 00:30:43.541
I think that's enough.

00:30:46.651 --> 00:30:48.031
Shit...

00:30:48.031 --> 00:30:51.051
Here comes Prince Five! The Prince Five!

00:30:56.691 --> 00:30:58.101
Why?

00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:27.921
- Attention!
- Sit down.

00:31:27.921 --> 00:31:29.881
Five...

00:31:29.881 --> 00:31:31.281
Four...

00:31:32.301 --> 00:31:33.911
What are you counting?

00:31:34.761 --> 00:31:38.141
We have to enjoy this
moment as much as possible.

00:31:38.141 --> 00:31:39.681
Three...

00:31:39.681 --> 00:31:41.071
Two...

00:31:41.991 --> 00:31:43.461
One...

00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:48.501
What did I tell you to
do right after school?

00:31:49.441 --> 00:31:52.021
Go straight home.

00:31:53.691 --> 00:31:56.481
That's right. Straight home.

00:31:56.481 --> 00:31:59.281
Don't stay out after 10 p.m.

00:31:59.281 --> 00:32:02.921
You can't go to the library to
study, either. Just study at home.

00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:05.041
If you can't study well, just sleep.

00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:06.551
Sleep is good medicine.

00:32:06.551 --> 00:32:10.311
Mountains and rivers are
forbidden, even during the day.

00:32:10.311 --> 00:32:11.941
So just don't go.

00:32:11.941 --> 00:32:14.491
Don't go anywhere dark and remote.

00:32:14.491 --> 00:32:16.461
Don't trust anyone carelessly.

00:32:16.461 --> 00:32:18.961
Bad people will approach you with a smile.

00:32:18.961 --> 00:32:23.791
For now, only deal with school,
home, you, and your friends.

00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:26.181
Just wait a few months
until you're 20 years old.

00:32:26.181 --> 00:32:28.171
You'll have freedom from then onward.

00:32:28.171 --> 00:32:31.941
- And...
- Can we just start the class, please?

00:32:37.641 --> 00:32:39.331
Open your books.

00:32:42.811 --> 00:32:46.931
During the five seconds
before he starts nagging,

00:32:46.931 --> 00:32:48.581
he's a prince for those five seconds.

00:32:48.581 --> 00:32:50.611
Five-second prince.

00:32:50.611 --> 00:32:51.811
His nickname is Prince Five.

00:32:51.811 --> 00:32:54.761
Do we have to listen to that every class?

00:32:56.021 --> 00:32:59.061
- That's terrifying.
- He constantly bans us from doing anything,

00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:01.091
so sometimes he's called Prince Ban.

00:33:02.771 --> 00:33:04.581
You can't tell him!

00:33:05.681 --> 00:33:08.711
But why do you guys
keep calling him Prince?

00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:12.641
How can you not?

00:33:12.641 --> 00:33:17.001
We will identify the composition motive and
use of "Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven."

00:33:17.001 --> 00:33:22.121
We will understand the characteristics
of the form and expressions in

00:33:23.441 --> 00:33:25.141
"Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven."

00:33:25.141 --> 00:33:29.571
First, let's discuss the value of "Songs
of the Dragons Flying to Heaven."

00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:31.781
As I mentioned yesterday,

00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:35.511
"Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven" is
the very first epic poem written in Korean.

00:33:35.511 --> 00:33:37.601
Also, as a representative work in
academic and political literature,

00:33:37.601 --> 00:33:39.861
it holds great value in Korean literature.

00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:43.791
This work is historically valuable
in studying the language used from

00:33:43.791 --> 00:33:47.821
the end of the Koryo period to
the beginning of the Joseon period.

00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:54.641
Hello, teacher.

00:33:57.211 --> 00:34:00.081
Gosh, you're such an old fart.

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:05.171
I can't stand fighting, either.

00:34:05.171 --> 00:34:07.851
I told you not to stand out in any way.

00:34:07.851 --> 00:34:12.041
But on your first day,
you act like a UFC fighter.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.011
Let's just do what we need to
do instead of criticizing each other.

00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:18.641
That's what I was going to say.

00:34:18.641 --> 00:34:22.201
Don't stare at me too much during class.

00:34:28.231 --> 00:34:31.231
Don't go anywhere after class
and just remain in the classroom.

00:34:31.231 --> 00:34:33.641
I'll come pick you up.

00:34:33.641 --> 00:34:35.421
Mr. Yoon.

00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:38.161
Okay, go on your way then. Go, go.

00:34:38.161 --> 00:34:40.271
Speaking down to me...

00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:43.581
Thank you for earlier.

00:34:44.581 --> 00:34:46.721
Your compliment on my writing assignment.

00:34:46.721 --> 00:34:50.081
Oh, I just said it since you wrote well.

00:34:50.081 --> 00:34:51.551
Nothing to thank me for.

00:34:51.551 --> 00:34:54.521
I was a little shy to
show you this assignment.

00:34:55.491 --> 00:34:59.781
Do you really think I can
be a novelist one day?

00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:01.311
Of course.

00:35:01.311 --> 00:35:03.651
Not too far in the future.

00:35:03.651 --> 00:35:06.431
You may become very famous.

00:35:06.431 --> 00:35:08.511
So try your best.

00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:25.681
So does he know Go Mi Sook?

00:35:27.551 --> 00:35:30.541
Well, she is a bestselling writer.

00:35:31.921 --> 00:35:33.561
[Academic Point]

00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:39.041
She wasn't in the bathroom...

00:35:40.561 --> 00:35:42.281
Where did she go?

00:35:48.401 --> 00:35:50.051
Did you bring it?

00:35:50.891 --> 00:35:52.341
Yes.

00:35:52.341 --> 00:35:54.011
Well,

00:35:54.011 --> 00:35:56.751
I corrected the awkward sentences and

00:35:56.751 --> 00:36:00.591
revised the parts that weren't very clear.

00:36:05.911 --> 00:36:08.581
You're working so hard because of my essay.

00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:27.501
But...

00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:31.351
the sentences I wrote
are almost all removed.

00:36:40.461 --> 00:36:42.581
That...

00:36:42.581 --> 00:36:44.251
It's okay.

00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:48.241
Well, that's how I'll
get a good final draft.

00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:51.631
I'm the one who wrote
the original work, anyway.

00:36:52.731 --> 00:36:57.581
Editing is something anyone
can do, don't you think?

00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:00.891
Yes.

00:37:00.891 --> 00:37:02.351
That's right.

00:37:04.841 --> 00:37:07.451
Come out after a little while.

00:37:07.451 --> 00:37:08.751
Okay.

00:37:26.501 --> 00:37:29.341
The responses are good
only when you edit them...

00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:31.961
so I don't really have complaints, either.

00:37:33.271 --> 00:37:36.821
Editing is something anyone can do.

00:38:01.011 --> 00:38:03.921
So this is what you've
been doing all along?

00:38:05.881 --> 00:38:08.861
I had my doubts, but
you're the same person.

00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:15.881
Do you even know how to
write without anyone's help?

00:38:16.838 --> 00:38:18.461
I've seen it for six years, but

00:38:18.461 --> 00:38:24.361
it's surprising you couldn't even complete
your own essay without someone's help.

00:38:24.361 --> 00:38:27.821
If you really think anyone can
do it, then you could do it yourself.

00:38:27.821 --> 00:38:32.411
How can you be so proud even after
using someone else's time and abilities?

00:38:34.461 --> 00:38:36.681
No, this isn't being proud.

00:38:39.661 --> 00:38:43.961
You feel it's shameful yourself. That's
why you talk hiding in a place like this.

00:38:46.111 --> 00:38:47.691
This kind of thing

00:38:48.711 --> 00:38:51.871
can't remain a secret,
at least in this place.

00:38:54.571 --> 00:38:56.451
Let's go to the teachers' office.

00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:17.861
Mi Sook, are you okay?

00:39:24.941 --> 00:39:26.391
This...

00:39:28.861 --> 00:39:31.041
I'm doing this because I want to.

00:39:33.441 --> 00:39:35.111
The class will start soon.

00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:36.621
Come along.

00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:39.421
Mi Sook, let's go.

00:40:06.061 --> 00:40:10.781
What did she do to her that
my mom can't say anything?

00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:13.181
There is something going on.

00:40:20.561 --> 00:40:23.221
I've never seen you before.

00:40:24.781 --> 00:40:27.811
Are you in 12 grade, Class 1?

00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:37.891
Do you know someone named
Lee Soon Ae in your class?

00:40:37.891 --> 00:40:39.511
Soon Ae?

00:40:39.511 --> 00:40:42.051
What about Soon Ae?

00:40:42.051 --> 00:40:47.581
Could you give this to her for me?

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:52.711
Yoo Beom Ryong!

00:40:59.961 --> 00:41:03.821
Do you know how
suspicious you look right now?

00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:09.401
Don't you know you're not supposed
to be in the girls' classroom hallway?

00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:11.691
Are you scoffing at school regulations?

00:41:11.691 --> 00:41:15.341
N-No, Mr. Yoon. I'm sorry.

00:41:15.341 --> 00:41:18.471
- Please forgive me just once.
- Follow me.

00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:39.061
Bye!

00:41:40.991 --> 00:41:45.431
If Go Mi Sook really
stole the novel Mom wrote,

00:41:45.431 --> 00:41:48.501
today's incident was just the beginning.

00:41:58.461 --> 00:42:00.191
Geez.

00:42:00.191 --> 00:42:04.121
She won't be able to sleep
well after acting like that anyway.

00:42:09.781 --> 00:42:12.471
Why isn't he coming?

00:42:13.471 --> 00:42:16.871
Telling me not to go
anywhere and just wait.

00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:31.641
Be careful.

00:42:32.911 --> 00:42:34.211
What?

00:42:35.241 --> 00:42:37.501
Be careful, Yoon Young.

00:42:53.481 --> 00:42:55.021
Are you really just leaving?

00:42:55.021 --> 00:42:57.361
For tonight's team dinner, Principal said

00:42:57.361 --> 00:43:02.421
even if the skies split in two and the
grounds crack, everyone must attend.

00:43:02.421 --> 00:43:05.951
He usually uses those extreme expressions.

00:43:05.951 --> 00:43:07.391
All right, then.

00:43:09.181 --> 00:43:13.671
What do you know, after
being here only a month?

00:43:13.671 --> 00:43:18.641
But why does the
Principal like him so much?

00:43:19.981 --> 00:43:22.051
I'm sorry I'm late...

00:43:24.281 --> 00:43:26.021
Not here?

00:43:37.311 --> 00:43:38.581
What?

00:43:39.481 --> 00:43:42.871
You're not as smart as I thought you were.

00:43:47.611 --> 00:43:49.981
Threats only work

00:43:49.981 --> 00:43:53.451
with people who have something to fear.

00:43:53.451 --> 00:43:56.401
I don't know if that kind of warning
kept Soon Ae around all this time.

00:43:56.401 --> 00:43:58.661
But listen.

00:43:58.661 --> 00:44:03.221
All the cowardly things you did up
until now and plan to do in the future

00:44:03.221 --> 00:44:06.541
will no longer happen the way you want.

00:44:06.541 --> 00:44:09.771
I'm going to stop
everything, no matter what.

00:44:17.191 --> 00:44:19.141
I was right.

00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:27.401
Mi Sook!

00:44:52.151 --> 00:44:55.351
Where the heck did she go?

00:44:56.611 --> 00:45:00.381
That girl who transferred
to 12th grade, Class 1.

00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:07.311
What are you doing, standing here?

00:45:07.311 --> 00:45:10.511
Let's go. Mother said you
should come home early.

00:45:15.461 --> 00:45:17.371
I need to stop by somewhere.

00:45:17.371 --> 00:45:19.291
You should go ahead today.

00:45:27.621 --> 00:45:29.711
Hey, Go Mi Sook!

00:45:42.841 --> 00:45:45.791
Do you think my little
sister escaped just now?

00:45:47.981 --> 00:45:49.731
Oh, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop.

00:45:49.731 --> 00:45:52.481
I just opened the window for some air.

00:45:54.021 --> 00:45:56.521
I'm sorry, but

00:45:56.521 --> 00:45:59.301
you don't understand Mi Sook's ways at all.

00:46:01.121 --> 00:46:02.781
If you want to fight your opponent,

00:46:02.781 --> 00:46:06.121
shouldn't you know them well first?

00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:12.741
Oh, which way are you going?

00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:20.351
Next time, I should write a
note to that transfer student.

00:46:20.351 --> 00:46:23.431
Hey! You said you have a girlfriend.

00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:27.481
Hey, don't you know love
can change whenever?

00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:30.271
Whenever I see pretty girls,

00:46:30.271 --> 00:46:33.941
I bravely send them...

00:46:36.958 --> 00:46:38.491
love letters first.

00:46:38.491 --> 00:46:40.211
First, I test the waters.

00:46:40.211 --> 00:46:42.861
Test what? You can't
even take a dump alone...

00:46:42.861 --> 00:46:45.541
I should have asked for her phone number...

00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:49.061
Geez! If only that darn
teacher hadn't shown up!

00:46:55.115 --> 00:46:59.611
I'll avoid that teacher and go
straight to her tomorrow. I'll be cool.

00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:00.891
Don't say anything!

00:47:00.891 --> 00:47:03.111
"What's your phone number?"

00:47:03.111 --> 00:47:08.051
Yeah, it's 53-2355.

00:47:08.051 --> 00:47:11.601
53-2355?

00:47:11.601 --> 00:47:14.011
Oh, I've heard that number somewhere...

00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:17.841
Hey! That's that darn teacher's number!

00:47:17.841 --> 00:47:21.771
Yeah, that transfer
student lives at my house.

00:47:21.771 --> 00:47:24.891
Call if you want to see
her. I'll answer for you.

00:47:29.311 --> 00:47:31.421
Hurry up and go home.

00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:49.451
What do I do?

00:48:05.488 --> 00:48:07.387
I know it's a coincidence
but what a relief.

00:48:07.387 --> 00:48:09.426
You didn't have an umbrella.

00:48:11.458 --> 00:48:15.141
I can speak casually since
you're a student, right?

00:48:15.141 --> 00:48:16.681
I'm 22 years old.

00:48:18.031 --> 00:48:19.641
Oh, yeah.

00:48:23.537 --> 00:48:27.900
But what did you mean by that earlier?

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.390
That I don't know Go Mi Sook's ways at all?

00:48:33.413 --> 00:48:36.071
You said she threatened you?

00:48:36.071 --> 00:48:38.101
If you felt that directly,

00:48:38.101 --> 00:48:40.891
then there's a high chance that's not real.

00:48:40.891 --> 00:48:44.401
It's just a kind of light test.

00:48:44.401 --> 00:48:46.101
Test?

00:48:46.101 --> 00:48:50.541
You know, seeing which
button to press to get a reaction.

00:48:50.541 --> 00:48:53.011
Trying to figure out your weakness.

00:48:53.011 --> 00:48:56.481
To see if there are any
secret cards to use against you.

00:48:56.481 --> 00:49:00.401
Until she fully figures out those
things, Mi Sook will never attack.

00:49:00.401 --> 00:49:02.521
And once she does figure them out...

00:49:04.478 --> 00:49:06.068
Then that's the end.

00:49:12.119 --> 00:49:17.269
Threats only work with people
who have something to fear.

00:49:20.961 --> 00:49:23.171
I was right.

00:49:23.171 --> 00:49:24.921
Be careful.

00:49:26.281 --> 00:49:27.641
What?

00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:30.841
Be careful, Yoon Young.

00:49:31.958 --> 00:49:34.474
You said she's your younger sister, but

00:49:34.474 --> 00:49:38.314
should you say these things to
me? To someone you just met?

00:49:42.268 --> 00:49:44.651
Because you look like you're in danger.

00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:47.451
When you look at one
place and rush toward it,

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:50.231
you fall into many traps.

00:50:29.347 --> 00:50:31.027
Are you okay?

00:50:35.497 --> 00:50:37.957
That's why you should have been careful.

00:50:56.357 --> 00:50:59.597
This will help you come to
your senses. Drink slowly.

00:51:31.747 --> 00:51:35.487
She's driving me crazy!

00:51:41.737 --> 00:51:43.377
Don't look at me like that.

00:51:43.377 --> 00:51:46.677
This is my house. Not anywhere dangerous.

00:51:48.017 --> 00:51:50.927
It's just that I have a
different way of doing things.

00:51:50.927 --> 00:51:52.457
No big deal.

00:51:52.457 --> 00:51:55.777
Let's just have a drink
and have a good time.

00:51:55.777 --> 00:51:58.877
It's because I like you. Okay?

00:52:07.127 --> 00:52:09.717
Does Go Mi Sook know you're like this?

00:52:10.867 --> 00:52:15.367
Well, she might know or
may pretend not to know.

00:52:16.657 --> 00:52:18.897
You mean this isn't the first time?

00:52:26.087 --> 00:52:28.677
I just mean you'll be okay soon.

00:52:46.067 --> 00:52:47.397
Aigoo.

00:52:48.397 --> 00:52:50.507
Looks like you got a cut.

00:53:02.017 --> 00:53:04.137
I said you will be okay.

00:53:34.657 --> 00:53:36.767
How dare you...

00:53:46.627 --> 00:53:48.537
You asshole!

00:53:52.067 --> 00:53:53.857
You asshole...

00:53:59.437 --> 00:54:01.137
Are you all right?

00:54:08.237 --> 00:54:09.807
Come here!

00:54:31.877 --> 00:54:34.977
You told me to believe you!

00:54:38.497 --> 00:54:40.127
It's really not me.

00:54:40.127 --> 00:54:42.107
I feel wronged.

00:54:42.107 --> 00:54:43.687
Please believe me.

00:54:43.687 --> 00:54:45.757
Then let's see each other at Woojung-ri.

00:54:45.757 --> 00:54:48.837
Then I'll let you know what that means.

00:54:48.837 --> 00:54:51.397
Stay alive, and you'll see.

00:54:51.397 --> 00:54:55.097
I was worried you wouldn't,
I mean, you couldn't come.

00:54:55.097 --> 00:54:56.437
But what a relief.

00:55:07.677 --> 00:55:09.177
Listen to me carefully.

00:55:10.207 --> 00:55:13.537
From this point onward,
your life will be miserable.

00:55:13.537 --> 00:55:18.017
I won't take my eyes off of you even for
a moment and watch you until the end.

00:55:18.017 --> 00:55:20.977
If you have to pay for your
crimes, no matter what they may be,

00:55:20.977 --> 00:55:24.347
I'll make sure you pay for
every single one of them.

00:55:25.717 --> 00:55:29.037
So you'll have to live a proper life.

00:55:29.037 --> 00:55:32.087
Prisoner number 4013.

00:55:32.087 --> 00:55:33.837
Go Min Soo.

00:55:36.797 --> 00:55:39.447
W-Who are you?

00:56:38.767 --> 00:56:40.777
Let's take care of that.

00:57:02.127 --> 00:57:05.667
How did you know I would be there?

00:57:28.367 --> 00:57:31.857
I thought that's where
it would happen next.

00:57:31.857 --> 00:57:35.417
This is the list of prime
suspects at the time.

00:57:35.417 --> 00:57:37.367
Including you, there are
a total of three people.

00:57:37.367 --> 00:57:39.767

00:58:03.851 --> 00:58:08.267

Go Min Soo.

[Bong Bong Cafe]

00:58:50.387 --> 00:58:52.257
Who are you?

00:58:54.207 --> 00:58:56.707
And why are you here?

[My Perfect Stranger]

00:59:35.854 --> 00:59:38.217
Two days before the first incident,

00:59:38.217 --> 00:59:41.144
one of the suspects
was already arrested, and

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:44.981
the other two didn't
have any particular points.

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:48.185
Just when everything was
swept into a foggy state,

00:59:48.185 --> 00:59:50.253
she arrived.

00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:53.537
The first victim.

00:59:53.537 --> 00:59:58.077
That man knows something.

00:59:58.077 --> 01:00:01.657
If, by any chance, she doesn't
know what's going to happen here,

01:00:01.657 --> 01:00:03.066
I need to let her know.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:06.447
Since I don't know what's
going to happen from now.
