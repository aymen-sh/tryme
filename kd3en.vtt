00:01.010 --> 00:05.180
<b>This appears to be their second file, sir.</b>

00:06.550 --> 00:10.540
<b>What on earth is their 
top general doing out <i>here</i>?</b>

00:11.410 --> 00:15.120
<b>A few more units are catching up 
from further in.</b>

00:15.570 --> 00:17.690
<b>Crush them all.</b>

00:17.690 --> 00:19.520
<b>Don't let a single squad through.</b>

00:19.540 --> 00:30.420
<b>Central Hill</b>

00:20.000 --> 00:25.190
<b>Qing She and his squad of elites had run
diagonally along the foot of the central hill,</b>

00:25.190 --> 00:27.410
<b>making huge bounds through the forest</b>

00:27.410 --> 00:30.310
<b>and attacking Lei Tu's second file
directly from the side.</b>

00:30.420 --> 00:37.800
<b>Yue Ying</b>

00:30.790 --> 00:33.660
<b>What's more, the units on the 
Qing She Army's right flank</b>

00:33.660 --> 00:37.250
<b>were advancing on Lei Tu's 
first file one after another.</b>

00:38.120 --> 00:41.520
<b>Before they knew it, Lei Tu's
and Ze Nuo's units</b>

00:41.520 --> 00:46.940
<b>found themselves in desperate straits, 
isolated and surrounded.</b>

00:47.470 --> 00:50.530
<b>This is where we sever their 
head from its reinforcements.</b>

00:51.340 --> 00:52.770
<b><i>Sever</i>?!</b>

00:53.330 --> 00:56.870
<b>You started this--and there's 
no going back now, Huan Yi.</b>

02:28.580 --> 02:31.670
<b>Heiyong at Night</b>

02:34.320 --> 02:35.860
<b>The instinctive type...</b>

02:36.220 --> 02:40.010
<b>Li Mu often compares Qing She to a spider.</b>

02:41.130 --> 02:45.100
<b>A formidable spider, spinning
a web of invisible threads.</b>

02:45.980 --> 02:48.660
<b>Just when his foes think
they're in a good position,</b>

02:48.660 --> 02:52.110
<b>they find themselves captured
--and soon, corpses.</b>

02:53.420 --> 02:54.420
<b>Huan Yi...</b>

02:54.890 --> 02:59.320
<b>He's gone and touched the spider's web, 
however inadvertently.</b>

02:59.440 --> 03:04.570
<b>Here it's day one, and Huan Yi 
will be getting an arm devoured.</b>

03:11.040 --> 03:13.700
<b>Dammit, they just keep coming!</b>

03:13.700 --> 03:16.060
<b>Where's the next file?</b>

03:16.060 --> 03:17.040
<b>I don't kn--</b>

03:17.720 --> 03:20.670
<b>Peng Lu and his guys just left 
to check on them!</b>

03:20.670 --> 03:22.750
<b>He figures they might've gotten lost!</b>

03:23.900 --> 03:24.970
<b>Lei Tu, sir!</b>

03:24.970 --> 03:26.030
<b>Behind you!</b>

03:26.030 --> 03:27.440
<b>Hey, Peng Lu!</b>

03:28.130 --> 03:30.750
<b>There's no trace of our
reinforcements! Not a one!</b>

03:30.750 --> 03:35.030
<b>A-And when I went further back, 
I found enemy soldiers instead!</b>

03:35.030 --> 03:38.410
<b>What?! Wh-What do you mean?</b>

03:38.410 --> 03:42.030
<b>I <i>mean</i> that we've got pursuers
instead of reinforcements!</b>

03:46.960 --> 03:48.080
<b>Tch.</b>

03:49.110 --> 03:54.560
<b>No wonder they're so cocky 
in the face of the Ze Nuo Gang's mayhem.</b>

03:57.900 --> 04:00.080
<b>This might be a first...</b>

04:00.080 --> 04:03.820
<b>I don't think the boss has ever 
been so thoroughly set up.</b>

04:05.280 --> 04:09.380
<b>Boss, there's something off
about Lei Tu's unit...</b>

04:10.990 --> 04:12.920
<b>As Lei Tu had surmised,</b>

04:12.920 --> 04:17.250
<b>this crisis was far beyond 
anything Huan Yi had predicted.</b>

04:18.180 --> 04:19.490
<b>Boss...</b>

04:22.000 --> 04:23.640
<b>Just watch.</b>

04:25.670 --> 04:30.340
<b>However, there was one thing
Qing She had not realized.</b>

04:33.530 --> 04:36.350
<b>The Huan Yi Army had 
a special wisdom</b>

04:36.350 --> 04:39.050
<b>that only former bandit 
bands could possess.</b>

04:39.280 --> 04:40.260
<b>Ze Nuo!</b>

04:41.170 --> 04:43.270
<b>Hear me out, 
would ya?</b>

04:43.550 --> 04:45.520
<b>Sound the Fire Hare!</b>

04:51.620 --> 04:52.610
<b>Whistles?</b>

05:03.160 --> 05:03.630
<b>Shit!</b>

05:03.630 --> 05:04.600
<b>Dammit!</b>

05:08.210 --> 05:09.880
<b>The Fire Hare whistle.</b>

05:09.880 --> 05:14.450
<b>Its sound meant "backs against
the wall, completely surrounded."</b>

05:14.450 --> 05:17.620
<b>Individual units needed no
 messages or orders.</b>

05:18.310 --> 05:23.200
<b>Hearing this whistle brought Huan Yi's
soldiers back to their bandit days,</b>

05:23.200 --> 05:27.760
<b>all bolting like rabbits to be 
the first away from the scene.</b>

05:39.190 --> 05:40.300
<b>Why, you--</b>

05:43.980 --> 05:45.860
<b>What gives with this lot?</b>

05:45.860 --> 05:49.340
<b>So unseemly! So chaotic!</b>

05:51.780 --> 05:55.280
<b>Have you amateurs never
heard of a rear guard?</b>

05:57.660 --> 05:59.970
<b>You really are apes--mountain apes!</b>

05:59.970 --> 06:03.180
<b>You're so boneheaded that
 I've started to take a shine to you,</b>

06:03.180 --> 06:04.670
<b>Huan Yi!</b>

06:05.050 --> 06:09.210
<b>Onward! Strike those mountain 
apes square in their backs!</b>

06:13.800 --> 06:17.230
<b>Those were Lei Tu's and Ze Nuo's
Fire Hares, weren't they.</b>

06:17.230 --> 06:17.940
<b>Yep.</b>

06:18.460 --> 06:22.030
<b>Even as a bystander, 
I hate to hear that sound.</b>

06:22.790 --> 06:24.780
<b>Takes you back, does it?</b>

06:24.780 --> 06:25.900
<b>That it does.</b>

06:26.280 --> 06:30.240
<b>Both units are being pummeled 
from behind right about now.</b>

06:33.690 --> 06:37.920
<b>Still, leave it to Lei Tu 
to make such a snap decision.</b>

06:38.280 --> 06:39.250
<b>Yep.</b>

06:40.590 --> 06:43.350
<b>Sounding the Fire Hare 
before they were surrounded</b>

06:43.350 --> 06:46.060
<b>means both units will 
likely escape intact.</b>

06:46.060 --> 06:50.630
<b>To Zhao, they must look like
 rank amateurs on the run.</b>

06:53.170 --> 06:58.560
<b>But when all's said and done, running like that keeps the most men alive.</b>

06:58.920 --> 07:00.270
<b>Right.</b>

07:01.870 --> 07:04.540
<b>They were well skilled at running.</b>

07:04.540 --> 07:09.620
<b>As bandits, they had evaded the Qin army,
 hiding deep in the mountains.</b>

07:10.150 --> 07:14.900
<b>Their experience taught them that a scattered,
"every man for himself" retreat</b>

07:14.900 --> 07:18.720
<b>carried the highest rate of survival.</b>

07:20.120 --> 07:24.660
<b>While individuals targeted by
multiple enemies stood no chance,</b>

07:24.660 --> 07:28.400
<b>their deaths afforded time
for most of the others to escape.</b>

07:34.490 --> 07:38.270
<b>Wh-What's going on here? 
The horses can't keep up!</b>

07:39.110 --> 07:40.700
<b>Above all, they ran so fast</b>

07:41.060 --> 07:45.490
<b>that Yue Ying's soldiers 
couldn't believe their eyes.</b>

07:46.920 --> 07:49.250
<b>There was also another advantage.</b>

07:49.640 --> 07:51.600
<b>R-Report!</b>

07:52.290 --> 07:57.600
<b>We have lost track of the two 
large men thought to be commanders!</b>

07:58.070 --> 08:00.520
<b>What?! Ridiculous!</b>

08:00.520 --> 08:03.580
<b>You let enemy commanders slip away
before your very eyes?!</b>

08:03.580 --> 08:05.830
<b>Now hunt them down 
and bring us their heads!</b>

08:05.830 --> 08:08.550
<b>We've sent men in pursuit, sir!</b>

08:08.790 --> 08:13.160
<b>If only they had a rear guard,
 we could trace forward.</b>

08:13.160 --> 08:17.560
<b>But they've scattered to the winds, 
not even guarding their officers.</b>

08:17.760 --> 08:20.140
<b>Once we lose sight of them...</b>

08:22.060 --> 08:25.980
<b>To be honest, we're not even sure 
we're really on their trail...</b>

08:26.930 --> 08:28.870
<b>Send out more pursuit squads!</b>

08:28.870 --> 08:32.030
<b>These are <i>commanders</i>! 
Do <i>not</i> let them escape!</b>

08:39.580 --> 08:40.800
<b>Tch.</b>

08:40.800 --> 08:44.250
<b>It's already practically 
nightfall, dammit.</b>

08:44.520 --> 08:47.420
<b>How many of us bit 
the dust, do you think?</b>

08:47.420 --> 08:49.260
<b>Like I know!</b>

08:49.260 --> 08:50.540
<b>That you, Lei Tu?</b>

08:51.200 --> 08:53.050
<b>Ah, Ze Nuo!</b>

08:53.050 --> 08:56.040
<b>Whoa! Brought a lot of your buddies, huh?</b>

08:56.470 --> 08:59.030
<b>So you're here, too.</b>

08:59.030 --> 09:00.260
<b>Yeah.</b>

09:03.250 --> 09:07.480
<b>Are you thinkin' what 
I'm thinkin', Lei Tu?</b>

09:07.480 --> 09:09.730
<b>Zhao</b>

09:07.960 --> 09:08.990
<b>Yeah.</b>

09:45.760 --> 09:49.700
<b>All that fencing they built, 
and it's nothing but ashes.</b>

09:49.700 --> 09:52.270
<b>It'll make a good watch fire tonight.</b>

09:53.890 --> 09:57.280
<b>Remember this, Zhao scum:</b>

09:57.860 --> 10:03.400
<b>We're former bandits, and no matter
 how badly we screw up,</b>

10:03.700 --> 10:06.820
<b>we sure as <i>hell</i> ain't 
going home empty-handed!</b>

10:07.380 --> 10:08.680
<b>Damn straight.</b>

10:19.010 --> 10:25.270
<b>Fei</b>

10:20.010 --> 10:25.200
<b>The enemy has their best chance 
while we're still unfamiliar with this terrain.</b>

10:25.780 --> 10:30.740
<b>The Zhao army <i>will</i> be attacking 
us on this first night!</b>

10:31.480 --> 10:34.360
<b>Perimeter troops, 
be ready to fight at any moment!</b>

10:37.940 --> 10:43.700
<b>Double the number of lookouts! I want regular updates from the scouts in the brush!</b>

10:43.700 --> 10:47.350
<b>Get into your positions 
before the moon is clouded over!</b>

10:48.740 --> 10:53.220
<b>Dammit. We've never camped so close
 to the enemy in such a deep forest before.</b>

10:53.220 --> 10:54.200
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:54.200 --> 10:58.740
<b>And if they come with their torches unlit, 
we won't know how close they are.</b>

11:02.330 --> 11:03.440
<b>Xin?</b>

11:04.860 --> 11:07.500
<b>Hey, Chu Shui. That was fast.</b>

11:07.860 --> 11:10.040
<b>East side's all set?</b>

11:10.040 --> 11:10.870
<b>Yes.</b>

11:11.600 --> 11:13.850
<b>The west should be done soon, too.</b>

11:13.850 --> 11:17.700
<b>But listen, Xin: as I understand it, 
Qiang Lei still hasn't returned.</b>

11:19.200 --> 11:20.430
<b>Yeah.</b>

11:20.430 --> 11:24.250
<b>She vanished into the forest 
when she left on patrol.</b>

11:24.730 --> 11:26.260
<b>Ain't heard from her since.</b>

11:26.260 --> 11:30.840
<b>After Qiang Lei went on ahead, 
we returned to the near hill,</b>

11:30.840 --> 11:33.100
<b>which created a good-sized gap.</b>

11:33.980 --> 11:39.860
<b>If the Zhao army have slipped
 into that gap, it's possible that...</b>

11:40.620 --> 11:43.180
<b>That she's behind enemy lines.</b>

11:44.060 --> 11:47.550
<b>I mean, if she ain't back yet, 
that's probably it.</b>

11:47.550 --> 11:53.140
<b>She had only a small cavalry with her. I hope they weren't captured, but...</b>

11:53.630 --> 11:56.800
<b>She wouldn't let 
a mistake like that happen.</b>

11:56.800 --> 11:58.820
<b>I'm more worried about--</b>

11:58.820 --> 12:00.350
<b>X-Xin!</b>

12:01.540 --> 12:05.280
<b>A messenger from the main 
army--from General Huan Yi!</b>

12:08.500 --> 12:10.490
<b>Tch. Comin'!</b>

12:12.650 --> 12:14.750
<b>Uh-oh--there goes the moon.</b>

12:14.750 --> 12:16.260
<b>Should we light a fire?</b>

12:16.260 --> 12:17.560
<b>What are you, stupid?</b>

12:17.560 --> 12:18.850
<b>Keep your voices down.</b>

12:18.850 --> 12:21.700
<b>Ugh! I can't see a damn thing!</b>

12:22.360 --> 12:23.670
<b>Huddle up for a moment.</b>

12:24.450 --> 12:25.430
<b>Can you see this?</b>

12:27.510 --> 12:28.650
<b>Here.</b>

12:30.340 --> 12:32.420
<b>This here is the Fei Xin Force,</b>

12:32.420 --> 12:34.160
<b>and this is the Zhao army.</b>

12:34.480 --> 12:37.760
<b>Right now, we're somewhere around here...</b>

12:37.760 --> 12:39.070
<b>Probably.</b>

12:39.440 --> 12:43.110
<b>Th-Then... we're completely cut off.</b>

12:43.110 --> 12:47.330
<b>No wonder we kept comin' up behind Zhao soldiers whenever we tried to head back.</b>

12:47.620 --> 12:50.850
<b>Why is our force even so far behind?</b>

12:51.460 --> 12:53.870
<b>We should return at once, Qiang Lei.</b>

12:53.870 --> 12:56.540
<b>At this point, they 
won't be needing a patrol.</b>

12:56.800 --> 13:01.210
<b>But how? Zhao's camps 
will be on high alert, too.</b>

13:01.210 --> 13:02.700
<b>If we get too close...</b>

13:03.270 --> 13:08.550
<b>We'll have to run along the side, evade the Zhao armies, and circle around them.</b>

13:09.320 --> 13:13.120
<b>You'd run all that way 
without any torches?</b>

13:13.120 --> 13:16.870
<b>We can't even keep a sense 
of direction in this darkness.</b>

13:16.870 --> 13:18.220
<b>We won't circle around them.</b>

13:19.480 --> 13:23.980
<b>Sun Ren's right: Tomorrow we head back
 so I can lead our unit in battle.</b>

13:24.290 --> 13:26.680
<b>But there's something we need to do first.</b>

13:29.240 --> 13:32.160
<b>We're behind the enemy right now.</b>

13:32.750 --> 13:35.680
<b>An opportunity this good 
may never come again.</b>

13:39.630 --> 13:42.630
<b>Fei Xin Force Camp</b>

13:42.630 --> 13:45.130
<b>Xin, you shithead of a servant!</b>

13:45.370 --> 13:48.880
<b>Your incredible first-day blunder 
has earned you a beheading!</b>

13:53.020 --> 13:56.160
<b>Now hang on! You can't 
just waltz in here and--</b>

13:56.160 --> 13:59.890
<b>I can, because my boss is the
commanding general of this army.</b>

14:02.180 --> 14:05.390
<b>But he knows as well as I do
that taking your head now</b>

14:05.390 --> 14:10.220
<b>will only make things worse
 on the right flank.</b>

14:12.400 --> 14:15.350
<b>So he's commuting your sentence.</b>

14:16.320 --> 14:19.290
<b>I'll be bringing back an arm instead.</b>

14:19.750 --> 14:20.970
<b>Wait a second!</b>

14:20.970 --> 14:22.020
<b>That's still not--</b>

14:22.020 --> 14:23.260
<b>Well, what can you do?</b>

14:25.630 --> 14:27.330
<b>Right about here okay?</b>

14:31.090 --> 14:34.280
<b>Wh-What the hell do 
you think you're doing?!</b>

14:34.280 --> 14:35.350
<b>X-Xin!</b>

14:35.350 --> 14:39.350
<b>Shut it! Enough of your gripin'--
it's the first damn day!</b>

14:39.750 --> 14:42.200
<b>All that matters 
is who wins in the end!</b>

14:43.030 --> 14:46.690
<b>Now he's just lashing out.</b>

14:47.840 --> 14:50.170
<b>He's got you there, Mǎ Yin.</b>

14:50.170 --> 14:50.950
<b>Huh?</b>

14:50.950 --> 14:55.440
<b>Looks like threats and bluffing 
won't work on this bunch.</b>

14:55.440 --> 14:58.940
<b>But I really was told 
to bring back his right arm.</b>

14:58.940 --> 15:01.320
<b>Go dig a hole, Chu Shui.</b>

15:01.320 --> 15:04.560
<b>We'll bury these chumps 
and say the messenger never arrived.</b>

15:05.180 --> 15:06.810
<b>Th-This guy...</b>

15:07.210 --> 15:08.960
<b>Yo, messenger.</b>

15:09.120 --> 15:11.610
<b>Go back and tell 
General Huan Yi this!</b>

15:11.610 --> 15:16.900
<b>We take the responsibility for our mistake
 more seriously than anyone else!</b>

15:17.240 --> 15:21.490
<b>So starting on day two, we'll 
destroy all enemies in our path...</b>

15:21.940 --> 15:26.100
<b>...and the Fei Xin Force will create 
a chance to turn this battle around!</b>

15:26.230 --> 15:30.880
<b>And in the end, <i>I'm</i> the one who'll 
take General Qiang She's head</b>

15:30.880 --> 15:34.500
<b>and lead us to victory in Heiyong!</b>

15:38.520 --> 15:39.420
<b>Mǎ Yin.</b>

15:40.050 --> 15:43.480
<b>Tell the boss that Na Gui 
will assume the debt of the arm.</b>

15:44.570 --> 15:50.200
<b>I was sent here, after all--
I do bear some responsibility.</b>

15:51.820 --> 15:54.420
<b>Nothing wrong with defiant
 speeches from a captain.</b>

15:54.860 --> 16:00.220
<b>But as we saw today, we're
up against one tough customer.</b>

16:00.660 --> 16:02.170
<b>That's not a problem.</b>

16:03.600 --> 16:08.420
<b>Today's struggles showed me how 
to fight in this wooded terrain--</b>

16:08.420 --> 16:11.530
<b>what we can and can't do.</b>

16:12.060 --> 16:15.690
<b>I bet my own head that we'll 
break through the front line tomorrow</b>

16:15.690 --> 16:18.380
<b>and bring the unit alongside 
the central hill.</b>

16:23.040 --> 16:24.790
<b>I sure hope so.</b>

16:27.020 --> 16:28.680
<b>Not long afterward,</b>

16:28.680 --> 16:31.990
<b>the camp was attacked, 
just as He Liao Diao had predicted.</b>

16:32.320 --> 16:34.440
<b>Looks like we're all right.</b>

16:34.440 --> 16:37.850
<b>They can't do much 
if we know they're coming.</b>

16:38.410 --> 16:42.190
<b>I <i>am</i> worried that Qiang Lei 
hasn't returned, though.</b>

16:43.560 --> 16:44.840
<b>So am I.</b>

16:45.270 --> 16:47.320
<b>A dense forest at nighttime.</b>

16:47.320 --> 16:51.370
<b>Honestly, these conditions 
were practically <i>made</i> for her.</b>

16:51.600 --> 16:55.250
<b>Yeah. Which makes me worried 
she'll do something rash.</b>

16:55.250 --> 16:55.930
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

16:56.710 --> 16:59.760
<b>Tomorrow the real comeback begins.</b>

16:59.760 --> 17:03.010
<b>Get your butt back here, Qiang Lei.</b>

17:05.460 --> 17:07.710
<b>Zhao</b>

17:11.480 --> 17:13.890
<b>Th-This is impossible!</b>

17:13.890 --> 17:18.260
<b>This camp has zero openings! 
We sure this is the rear?</b>

17:18.260 --> 17:19.700
<b>It's no use, lieutenant.</b>

17:19.700 --> 17:22.420
<b>This enemy is bad news. We need to leave!</b>

17:24.720 --> 17:26.560
<b>Call it off, Qiang Lei.</b>

17:26.560 --> 17:30.930
<b>I don't doubt your prowess, 
but this is just too much.</b>

17:30.930 --> 17:32.740
<b>There's no way we 
can get in there,</b>

17:32.740 --> 17:36.870
<b>slay their commander, 
and make it out alive!</b>

17:40.140 --> 17:42.250
<b><i>You'll </i>all be here, standing by.</b>

17:43.420 --> 17:46.840
<b>If there's too much commotion, 
make yourselves scarce at once.</b>

17:46.840 --> 17:47.750
<b>Qiang Lei!</b>

17:48.220 --> 17:50.040
<b>I'm telling you, 
this is overkill!</b>

17:50.040 --> 17:55.220
<b>Our unit--our captain 
wouldn't want this!</b>

17:55.220 --> 17:57.510
<b>Not so loud, Sun Ren!</b>

17:57.510 --> 18:00.830
<b>Why in blazes are you intent 
on doing something so reckless?!</b>

18:05.120 --> 18:06.260
<b>Lieutenant...</b>

18:06.710 --> 18:09.210
<b>When you become 
a brigade commander,</b>

18:10.270 --> 18:16.520
<b>you do give some consideration to
 how many lives it will cost to defeat your foe.</b>

18:16.930 --> 18:20.460
<b>And now's our chance to slay the 
commander of a 10-thousand-man army</b>

18:20.460 --> 18:23.200
<b>with no casualties at all.</b>

18:23.280 --> 18:24.390
<b>So yes.</b>

18:25.180 --> 18:26.300
<b>That means...</b>

18:27.050 --> 18:29.620
<b>I'm being reckless 
for the Fei Xin Force.</b>

18:33.890 --> 18:37.960
<b>True, it won't be easy, 
but it's not impossible.</b>

18:40.900 --> 18:42.220
<b>Especially when...</b>

18:45.810 --> 18:50.880
<b>...you're a member of a tribe that's been doing this work for a thousand years.</b>

18:51.580 --> 18:53.080
<b>Let's go, Zhao commander.</b>

19:20.820 --> 19:22.050
<b>Shift's up.</b>

19:22.050 --> 19:22.810
<b>Right.</b>

19:46.670 --> 19:47.660
<b>Who's there?</b>

19:52.490 --> 19:57.680
<b>Idol worship, eh? 
Unusual, for an army commander.</b>

19:58.490 --> 20:00.940
<b>You have no right to laugh.</b>

20:02.520 --> 20:04.580
<b>I'm not laughing.</b>

20:04.580 --> 20:08.120
<b>I'm just here to take your life,</b>

20:08.170 --> 20:09.430
<b>Zhao commander.</b>

20:12.690 --> 20:15.190
<b>Zhao</b>

20:20.070 --> 20:22.030
<b>Are you some sort of ghost?</b>

20:28.260 --> 20:34.140
<b>I can't imagine anyone could infiltrate my camp and reach my sleeping quarters.</b>

20:34.140 --> 20:36.100
<b>Much less a woman.</b>

20:37.560 --> 20:39.080
<b>Yet here I am.</b>

20:41.120 --> 20:42.580
<b>Indeed.</b>

20:42.970 --> 20:48.510
<b>But just now, as you came into the torchlight,
you looked like something inhuman.</b>

20:50.740 --> 20:55.370
<b>It's because you cling to those dolls 
that things look that way.</b>

20:56.560 --> 21:01.390
<b>I do not cling to these. 
I use them as inspiration.</b>

21:02.490 --> 21:03.700
<b>Tell me.</b>

21:04.360 --> 21:08.860
<b>Is there anything you'd give
 your life to protect, woman?</b>

21:16.250 --> 21:17.720
<b>No, eh?</b>

21:20.310 --> 21:23.800
<b>I lost my one and only, long ago.</b>

21:24.750 --> 21:29.280
<b>And now... 
now I have another.</b>

21:32.460 --> 21:33.510
<b>I see.</b>

21:34.450 --> 21:36.240
<b>Enough of that, then.</b>

21:36.720 --> 21:40.770
<b>Pardon the interruption, Qiang Lei,
lieutenant of the Fei Xin Force.</b>

21:42.750 --> 21:46.500
<b>I remembered the rumors of 
a female lieutenant among the enemy,</b>

21:46.500 --> 21:48.710
<b>one who uses otherworldly techniques.</b>

21:48.710 --> 21:52.230
<b>In talking with you, I mostly managed 
to organize my thoughts.</b>

21:53.450 --> 21:56.320
<b>You, a lieutenant, 
making this rash move:</b>

21:56.320 --> 22:00.990
<b>It reveals the depth of your resolve, 
and for that, you have my respect.</b>

22:02.680 --> 22:03.620
<b>However...</b>

22:04.050 --> 22:06.920
<b>I too have a reason I cannot 
allow myself to be defeated.</b>

22:08.260 --> 22:13.000
<b>The Qin army must not be permitted 
to move beyond Heiyong!</b>

22:13.500 --> 22:15.350
<b><i>Beyond</i> Heiyong?</b>

22:18.350 --> 22:20.220
<b>Liu Dong's sleeping quarters!</b>

22:25.440 --> 22:26.290
<b>A thread?!</b>

22:35.420 --> 22:36.560
<b>May Heiyong be...</b>

22:36.560 --> 22:37.680
<b>your grave!</b>

22:42.640 --> 22:44.020
<b>Liu Dong, sir!</b>

22:44.020 --> 22:45.330
<b>Are you all right?</b>

22:45.330 --> 22:48.020
<b>It's the Fei Xin Force's woman lieutenant.</b>

22:48.940 --> 22:53.050
<b>I imagine she's still alive. 
Try to keep her that way.</b>

22:53.050 --> 22:53.560
<b>Sir!</b>

23:02.240 --> 23:03.380
<b>This way!</b>

23:04.930 --> 23:08.240
<b>--Stay close together!
--Make sure nothing gets past us!</b>

23:10.120 --> 23:12.470
<b>She's badly hurt. 
She won't be going far.</b>

23:12.470 --> 23:13.620
<b>Find her!</b>

23:13.620 --> 23:14.400
<b>Sir!</b>

24:45.000 --> 24:55.000
<b>A Lieutenant's Responsibility</b>

24:48.700 --> 24:52.570
<b>Next on Kingdom: "A Lieutenant's Responsibility."</b>
