14:58.000 --> 15:01.290
<b>Now, give me your deets like you promised.</b>

15:03.820 --> 15:05.770
<b>Let me hit the shower first.</b>

15:07.460 --> 15:10.130
<b>You rolled some glam
 end credits there, Isagi.</b>

15:10.130 --> 15:12.510
<b>Huh? Oh, uh, thanks.</b>

15:13.450 --> 15:15.200
<b>Nice goal, hero.</b>

15:15.560 --> 15:16.700
<b>Aiku.</b>

15:17.130 --> 15:19.890
<b>Were your eyes fixed on 
my blind spot that whole time?</b>

15:19.890 --> 15:20.920
<b>Yeah.</b>

15:21.530 --> 15:24.630
<b>And a spot I could take a direct shot from.</b>

15:25.290 --> 15:30.010
<b>Plus, I had faith that Rin's trance state
 could get the better of Itoshi Sae.</b>

15:30.460 --> 15:32.950
<b>It was the culmination 
of the full 90 minutes.</b>

15:34.460 --> 15:39.980
<b>So you reflexively ran to a spot 
where those three conditions would meet.</b>

15:41.040 --> 15:44.110
<b>And the ball coincidentally 
fell right to that spot, huh?</b>

15:45.180 --> 15:48.680
<b>You attracted good luck, Isagi Yoichi.</b>

15:50.610 --> 15:52.030
<b>We lost.</b>

15:53.190 --> 15:55.400
<b>Congratulations, Blue Lock.</b>

16:08.650 --> 16:09.500
<b>Rin.</b>

16:13.280 --> 16:15.040
<b>I misread it.</b>

16:15.470 --> 16:19.160
<b>I didn't think Japan was capable 
of producing a decent striker.</b>

16:19.640 --> 16:20.850
<b>Big Bro.</b>

16:21.630 --> 16:26.300
<b>The one who awakened your instincts
and can change the soccer of this country...</b>

16:28.810 --> 16:32.790
<b>That egoist, Isagi Yoichi, 
might be the one to do it.</b>

16:36.330 --> 16:39.400
<b>This country can still change.</b>

16:41.390 --> 16:45.810
<b>Yo, Isagi! They want you over there! 
For a post-match TV interview!</b>

16:45.810 --> 16:46.880
