WEBVTT

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.223
When the kaiju appeared
and you told me to run,

00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:08.935
if you didn't save me then,

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.521
I would've died today.

00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:16.776
I really think you should be
a Defense Force officer.

00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:24.617
Thanks, Ichikawa.

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.745
I knew it. You're a really good guy.

00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:31.165
I'm going to try joining
the Defense Force again...

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:36.838
I found you.

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:38.631
Kai... Kai...

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:41.008
Senpai!

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.939
ORIGINAL SERIES BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.231
"It'll be okay.

00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:22.693
Anytime that happens,
I'll be right next to you!"

00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:27.573
Wow, Kafka-kun! You read too much manga!

00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:29.075
That was so corny!

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.910
You bastard!

00:02:30.993 --> 00:02:33.996
Don't say a word about this
to our moms, all right?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.707
Those two are always oversharing
with the other moms.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:43.464
Thanks.

00:02:46.217 --> 00:02:48.302
It's not so scary when it's the two of us.

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:00.690
The kaiju was discovered in the hospital.

00:03:01.357 --> 00:03:03.442
We must prevent any human casualties.

00:03:06.028 --> 00:03:07.988
We'll defeat this kaiju at all costs.

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:13.411
{\an8}A small kaiju has appeared in Yokohama.

00:03:13.494 --> 00:03:14.995
{\an8}I repeat.

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.789
A small kaiju has appeared in Yokohama.

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:19.417
This alert is so annoying!

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.420
-Why can't the government change it?
-Hurry, Sho-chan!

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:25.881
All civilians should immediately evacuate
to a shelter...

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:27.550
-Shut off the lights.
-...lock all doors...

00:03:28.592 --> 00:03:31.554
...and take all life-saving measures...

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.270
It's all a misunderstanding!

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:42.064
-Senpai, smile!
-Smile?

00:03:42.148 --> 00:03:43.482
Right. Got it. Smile.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.695
Oh, shit. This won't work.

00:03:48.738 --> 00:03:49.822
I knew it!

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:53.242
You all right, gramps?

00:04:04.045 --> 00:04:08.424
I did this to him? I'm seriously a kaiju!

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.635
-What is it?
-An explosion? Are you okay?

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.263
Is that a kaiju?

00:04:14.346 --> 00:04:16.515
Officers are on their way.

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:17.433
Let's run!

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:21.771
Right. We don't want to cause more trouble
for the hospital.

00:04:21.854 --> 00:04:23.773
Let's leave through this window!

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.362
I knew it!

00:04:30.446 --> 00:04:33.449
What's going on with this body?

00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:37.328
-Call the doctor, now!
-Let's run, senpai!

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:38.412
What?

00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:40.956
Hey! Wait!

00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:54.512
The kaiju escaped from
South Yokohama General Hospital.

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:56.680
It's heading towards an Evacuated Area.

00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:00.643
What the hell's going on?

00:05:00.726 --> 00:05:02.853
Senpai turned into a kaiju?

00:05:02.937 --> 00:05:05.397
Since when? Why?

00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:08.150
Anyways, is that even a kaiju?

00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:11.445
I want to confirm this just in case.

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:13.489
You really are senpai, right?

00:05:13.572 --> 00:05:16.867
I'm not so sure myself!

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:21.580
What the hell is that? You transformed!

00:05:21.664 --> 00:05:23.916
I want to know myself!

00:05:31.132 --> 00:05:34.051
Look, Ichikawa! I'm eating a live bird!

00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:37.346
So gross! You're really gross, senpai!

00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:41.350
-Oh, I turned back.
-Your transformations are gross!

00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:44.979
-Oh no, Ichikawa!
-What is it this time?

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:50.276
-I really need to pee.
-Right now? Hold it in!

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:52.736
This body's going to pee no matter what!

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.698
I can't do anything to stop it!

00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:57.199
I don't want to.

00:05:57.283 --> 00:06:00.369
I'm a human, an adult.
I don't want to pee in public!

00:06:00.452 --> 00:06:03.956
Where is it going to come out of?
I can't find any holes.

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:18.387
-Senpai!
-No one will marry me anymore.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.681
I'll die right here!

00:06:20.764 --> 00:06:23.183
There are other things
to worry about right now!

00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:26.437
Come on. Let's go!

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:28.814
Hey, Ichikawa.

00:06:28.898 --> 00:06:32.693
What's going to happen to me now?
Could I join the Defense Force?

00:06:32.776 --> 00:06:34.695
There's no way!

00:06:34.778 --> 00:06:38.032
You're on the side of being neutralized.
You'll be killed on the spot!

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.035
Right? I knew it!

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:44.038
Huh? In that case...

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:51.921
There's no way I'll ever become
a Defense Force officer.

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:58.052
Shit! After I swore to myself
that I'll catch up to her!

00:06:59.053 --> 00:07:01.555
How could I, with this body?

00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:05.184
Senpai!

00:07:05.976 --> 00:07:07.978
{\an8}ROAD CLOSED

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:12.900
This is a restriction line. There won't
be any civilians beyond this point.

00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:17.071
-Senpai?
-Quiet. Someone's coming.

00:07:17.154 --> 00:07:18.072
An officer?

00:07:18.656 --> 00:07:20.866
No, it's from underground.

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:23.410
This is...

00:07:31.043 --> 00:07:32.127
Another kaiju?

00:07:33.337 --> 00:07:35.005
Cart 2, continue forward.

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:37.424
We'll head to a new point.

00:07:40.386 --> 00:07:43.347
This is the same species that attacked us.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.224
You can tell?

00:07:45.307 --> 00:07:48.769
But this will split the number of officers
assigned to attack you.

00:07:48.852 --> 00:07:50.229
Now's our chance to hide!

00:07:50.813 --> 00:07:54.024
Luckily, all civilians have been evacuated
from your report.

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:56.443
Let's hope there are no victims!

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.003
Mom!

00:08:14.878 --> 00:08:16.171
Run...

00:08:16.922 --> 00:08:18.257
quickly...

00:08:18.841 --> 00:08:21.093
Give me a second. I'll save you!

00:08:33.814 --> 00:08:37.860
-Run!
-I won't go without you!

00:08:44.908 --> 00:08:47.328
Run... please...

00:08:48.078 --> 00:08:50.497
Please. Please!

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.500
Please!

00:08:55.794 --> 00:09:00.174
-No! Mom!
-Please!

00:09:17.316 --> 00:09:21.320
So powerful!

00:09:23.822 --> 00:09:25.366
You okay?

00:09:25.449 --> 00:09:29.411
Right, sorry about that. Well...

00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:32.790
-Smile!
-No!

00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:34.083
I'm sorry!

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:36.627
I'll go away! Don't cry!

00:09:37.294 --> 00:09:39.338
-Senpai!
-Yeah.

00:09:45.636 --> 00:09:47.596
Mom!

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:50.015
She's just unconscious. She'll be fine.

00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:52.267
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:09:58.774 --> 00:10:01.276
Ichikawa, look after those two.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.528
What are you doing?

00:10:06.198 --> 00:10:10.119
I'm going to punch him for real.

00:10:10.994 --> 00:10:12.121
Step back!

00:10:13.414 --> 00:10:15.374
â€ªOne, two...

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.547
Three!

00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:55.581
That was...

00:10:56.832 --> 00:11:00.252
Something you should never do to humans.

00:11:06.383 --> 00:11:07.676
Senpai?

00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:09.803
It'll be all right.

00:11:10.512 --> 00:11:12.306
Take her to the hospital.

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:28.030
Listen. The Defense Force
will be here any minute.

00:11:28.113 --> 00:11:30.908
I'll go away. You'll feel better then.

00:11:42.461 --> 00:11:44.713
Kaiju-san?

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:48.842
Thank you.

00:11:51.637 --> 00:11:52.554
Thanks.

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:57.059
It's not so scary when it's the two of us.

00:11:58.727 --> 00:12:00.979
Yeah! We'll be stronger together!

00:12:01.063 --> 00:12:02.064
Let's go!

00:12:26.129 --> 00:12:27.422
Right.

00:12:29.675 --> 00:12:31.134
I have to go.

00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:34.137
Senpai! I just called
the emergency services.

00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:36.181
Let's go before they arrive.

00:12:38.308 --> 00:12:39.476
Senpai?

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.230
Ichikawa. I decided not to give up.

00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:50.362
I have to be by her side.

00:13:07.504 --> 00:13:09.339
What happened here?

00:13:10.716 --> 00:13:12.134
What the hell is this?

00:13:26.982 --> 00:13:30.360
Tell me about the kaiju you saw.

00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:32.154
Kaiju.

00:13:37.492 --> 00:13:38.827
It'll be okay.

00:13:39.578 --> 00:13:43.040
I'm going to defeat all the kaiju.

00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:44.416
Really?

00:13:51.882 --> 00:13:55.969
Please don't defeat
that nice kaiju-san, though.

00:13:57.596 --> 00:14:00.515
He saved my mom.

00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:09.066
{\an8}A SKETCH BASED ON WITNESS ACCOUNTS

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:10.400
{\an8}Kaiju No. 8.

00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:14.154
{\an8}This became the eighth kaiju
with a code name

00:14:14.237 --> 00:14:16.239
provided by the Defense Force.

00:14:16.948 --> 00:14:19.660
No. 8 remains on the run,

00:14:19.743 --> 00:14:23.288
-and the Defense Force is on high alert...
-They haven't found him yet?

00:14:23.372 --> 00:14:24.915
Right?

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.833
Maybe it's dead already.

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:30.587
This became a bigger deal
than we expected.

00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:32.130
WITNESS - AGED 103

00:14:32.214 --> 00:14:35.842
Three months have passed. Senpai
became the first unneutralized kaiju

00:14:35.926 --> 00:14:38.178
since the founding of the Defense Force.

00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:41.098
He's now pursued by Defense Force officers
around Japan.

00:14:41.848 --> 00:14:43.600
Right, Ichikawa.

00:14:43.684 --> 00:14:46.812
This was delivered to you and Kafka.

00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:49.314
He had the morning shift, so he's on-site.

00:14:49.398 --> 00:14:51.566
-Take this to him.
-Yes, sir.

00:14:52.693 --> 00:14:54.778
It's already that time of year, huh?

00:14:55.278 --> 00:14:58.949
Kafka used to apply every year.

00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:00.283
It's an annual event.

00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:02.703
Along with the "sorry-you-didn't-pass"
party afterward.

00:15:03.578 --> 00:15:05.122
YOU HAVE PASSED THE PRELIMINARY ROUND...

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:08.417
-Nice. Great job!
-As expected of you!

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.376
Thanks.

00:15:09.459 --> 00:15:12.379
Should I take this to Kafka?

00:15:12.462 --> 00:15:15.382
No, it's all right. I'll bring it to him.

00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:35.444
-Looks like he passed, too.
-But this year is his last chance.

00:15:35.527 --> 00:15:39.072
God, I really hope he makes it.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.492
He's been working hard for so many years.

00:15:52.627 --> 00:15:53.462
Senpai!

00:15:54.212 --> 00:15:56.631
We passed the preliminary round!

00:15:58.759 --> 00:15:59.634
Seriously?

00:16:00.677 --> 00:16:02.429
Why are you all exposed?

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.474
Isn't it too early to be this violent?

00:16:05.557 --> 00:16:08.268
Your face!
Do you even know what's going on?

00:16:08.351 --> 00:16:12.481
Shit. It still comes out
without me realizing.

00:16:13.857 --> 00:16:15.859
-All good now!
-Not good at all!

00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:18.236
You were on the news just now,
in the office!

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.030
You have to be more careful!

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:22.616
Got it, got it. I'm sorry!

00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:26.203
As for senpai and me...

00:16:28.663 --> 00:16:31.208
-You're the patients!
-Are you all right?

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:33.502
Yes, we're fine.

00:16:33.585 --> 00:16:36.838
We told them we evacuated
after being shocked by the kaiju.

00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:40.842
Looks like no one knows yet, but...

00:16:44.596 --> 00:16:46.473
This is yours, senpai.

00:16:46.556 --> 00:16:48.141
SELECTION RESULTS

00:16:48.225 --> 00:16:49.976
YOU HAVE PASSED THE PRELIMINARY ROUND...

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.979
Oh, good. I'm glad.

00:16:53.063 --> 00:16:55.732
I thought you would be happier.

00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:58.485
I always get rejected in the second round!

00:16:58.568 --> 00:17:00.195
Why do you look so proud?

00:17:00.278 --> 00:17:02.989
So, what's your plan?

00:17:03.073 --> 00:17:06.368
You really intend on going
to the second round with that body?

00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:09.162
It'll be okay! I'll hide it really well!

00:17:09.246 --> 00:17:10.956
That's not reassuring!

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.792
Preliminaries are just documents
and written exams.

00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:16.378
There'll be a bunch of officers
at the second round!

00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:17.963
You could get killed on the spot...

00:17:18.046 --> 00:17:19.631
Even so, I'm going.

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:26.638
I did a bunch of research
in the three months we had,

00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:29.808
but I couldn't find any way
to turn back my body.

00:17:29.891 --> 00:17:32.894
I'm 32 now.
This year's round of applications

00:17:33.854 --> 00:17:35.814
is truly my last shot.

00:17:35.897 --> 00:17:37.065
JAPAN DEFENSE FORCE
RECRUITING OFFICERS

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:39.818
I understand.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.906
But no matter what happens to you,
I'm going to keep pushing forward.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.617
You're my rival, after all.

00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:56.209
This cap is so tight!

00:17:57.752 --> 00:17:59.796
I take it all back! Don't take the exams!

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.591
Wait, I'll be okay!

00:18:02.674 --> 00:18:05.135
-I'll hide it better during the exams!
-Let me go!

00:18:05.218 --> 00:18:06.678
Don't abandon me!

00:18:06.761 --> 00:18:09.472
I won't help you, no matter what!

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:13.476
Everyone's arriving soon.
Pull yourself together!

00:18:20.275 --> 00:18:23.904
I'm so glad! If he passed and I didn't,

00:18:23.987 --> 00:18:27.115
I would've failed as a senpai!

00:18:31.202 --> 00:18:33.163
All right. Time for a rematch.

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:37.792
{\an8}TEN DAYS LATER

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:46.927
{\an8}UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:52.140
{\an8}DEFENSE FORCE SCREENING EXAM SECOND ROUND
WEST TOKYO HALL

00:18:58.438 --> 00:19:01.942
MONSTER SWEEPER INC.

00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:10.158
Wow.

00:19:10.825 --> 00:19:13.286
So, this is the Defense Force's
Tachikawa Base.

00:19:14.704 --> 00:19:18.833
It's much bigger than the Kumagaya Base
that I visited on a field trip.

00:19:18.917 --> 00:19:22.003
This is attached to the Japan
Ground Self-Defense Force base.

00:19:22.712 --> 00:19:24.464
During emergencies,

00:19:24.547 --> 00:19:27.217
they work together to dispatch officers
all around West Tokyo.

00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:31.471
If you transformed right here,
you'd never survive.

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:51.366
Freaking out won't help us. Let's go!

00:19:52.575 --> 00:19:54.494
-Hey, old man.
-We're a bit early,

00:19:54.577 --> 00:19:55.996
but let's go sign in.

00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:58.707
-Listen, old man!
-Senpai.

00:20:01.918 --> 00:20:03.712
Yes, I'm talking to you.

00:20:03.795 --> 00:20:06.256
Took you long enough, old man.

00:20:06.965 --> 00:20:09.592
OLD MAN?

00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:11.428
Huh? Me?

00:20:11.511 --> 00:20:13.763
She's an applicant, too?

00:20:18.727 --> 00:20:22.063
I'm not old! I'm still 32!

00:20:22.147 --> 00:20:24.524
-So, you are old.
-I am?

00:20:25.942 --> 00:20:27.777
She's not wrong.

00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:31.656
That piece of junk is yours, right?
It's in the way.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.659
I can't park my car there. Move it over.

00:20:36.661 --> 00:20:40.498
-This lot is super empty!
-I want to park there.

00:20:41.082 --> 00:20:43.209
My lucky number of the day is five.

00:20:44.627 --> 00:20:49.090
Lucky number of the day, you say?

00:20:49.174 --> 00:20:52.844
You spoiled little girl...

00:20:52.927 --> 00:20:54.471
Come with me!

00:20:54.554 --> 00:20:57.807
This young man will teach you a thing
or two about manners.

00:20:58.433 --> 00:21:01.019
Fine. I'll move it myself.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.609
Geez, what are you doing?

00:21:13.573 --> 00:21:15.492
That suit...

00:21:40.725 --> 00:21:42.185
That's company property!

00:21:43.394 --> 00:21:45.355
Who are you?

00:21:45.438 --> 00:21:47.899
I'm applicant number 2016.

00:21:49.067 --> 00:21:52.779
Kikoru Shinomiya.
My hobby is killing kaiju.

00:21:53.363 --> 00:21:54.948
Remember my name, all right?

00:21:55.031 --> 00:21:58.326
Shinomiya! That means her family is...

00:21:58.409 --> 00:22:00.328
Forget that. Hey, old man.

00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:08.586
You smell like kaiju.
