WEBVTT

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:07.252
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.755
Come on, you gotta help me.
Come on.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:13.049
Leave.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.884
- Leave.
- Shut up, Joel.

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:18.137
- Take the gun.
- Joel, shut the fuck up!

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:22.599
You go. You go. You go north.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.310
You go to Tommy.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.647
You go.

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:28.916

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.727
Give 'em back!

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.271
Then pick up your pace.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.439
I'm not running doubles again

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.608
because of your shitty attitude.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.485
I don't wanna fight about it.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:56.945
Fight about it?

00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:59.321
You don't fight.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.657
Your friend fights.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.952
She's not here
anymore... is she?

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:43.365
What's goin' on?

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.826
You've never been what
I'd call well-behaved,

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.495
but the last few weeks?

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.545
Bethany started it.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.714
Well, Bethany's in the
infirmary with 15 stitches.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:04:59.881
- Good.
- Okay.

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:01.216
Just put me in the fuckin' hole.

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:04.077
I put you in the hole three times.
It doesn't work.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.472
- So I'm gonna try something new.
- What?

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:10.559
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.229
You're smart, Ellie. You're
so smart, you're stupid.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.605
You can't see
where this is going?

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:16.898
Let me help you out.

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:18.234
Two paths ahead of you.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.280
First path.
You keep acting like a grunt,

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.656
so you get the life of a grunt.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.117
Up at dawn. Walk the
streets, walk the wall.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.411
Ya eat shit food,
ya do shit jobs,

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.872
ya take shit orders
from your patrol leader,

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.082
who'll probably be Bethany.

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.917
And that'll be your life
from now until ya

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:37.961
catch a bullet from a Firefly,

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:39.254
or fall drunk off a roof,

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.095
or get your hair caught
in a moving tank tread.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.509
There's the other path.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.928
You swallow this pride of yours.

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:51.099
You follow the rules.
You become an officer.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.435
You get your own room.
You get a nice bed.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.604
We eat well.
We don't go on patrol.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.314
We're cool in the summer.
We're warm in the winter.

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.191
And best of all,
when you're an officer,

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:02.862
you get to tell the Bethanys of the
world exactly where to shove it.

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.576
Why do you even care?

00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:13.330
I care because no matter what
anyone out there says or thinks...

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:17.375
we're the only thing
holding this all together.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:20.295
If we go down, the people in the zone
will starve or murder each other.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.424
That much I know.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.595
There's a leader in you.

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:30.556
And one day,
it could be your turn.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.683
Or not.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.146
So which way?

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:43.652
Keys.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.029
Good.

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:53.037
- Is that it?
- That's it.

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:58.167
Can I have my Walkman back?

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.476
Lights out, ladies!

00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:02.106
Turn 'em off!

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:04.376
Riley! Where have you been?

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.544
What the fuck is wrong with you,

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:07.837
sneaking up on me like that?

00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:09.256
It was a joke, okay?

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:10.924
I thought it would work better.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.885
In my mind, you loved it.

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.807
So...

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.977
how's it going?

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:22.937
Okay, it's bad.

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:24.048
I thought you were dead.

00:09:24.073 --> 00:09:25.814
You've been gone
for three weeks.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.732
I should fuckin' stab you.

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.735
No, I appreciate your mercy.

00:09:35.032 --> 00:09:36.324
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:37.409
I just ran away
for a bit, that's all.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.327
If you're going
through some shit,

00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:40.954
you're supposed to,
I don't know,

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.540
talk to your
best friend about it?

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.710
I came back.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:50.171
- Wait, who gave you the black eye?
- Tell me where you were.

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:51.673
Gimme a name
and I'll fuck 'em up.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:54.342
It was Bethany and I
already fucked her up.

00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:56.012
Where were you?

00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:12.277
- I joined the Fireflies.
- Oh, fuck you.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.778
I'm not in the mood
for this, Riley.

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:16.614
I'm really not in the mood.

00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:18.283
- You're a Firefly?!
- Jesus!

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.368
I told you I'd fuckin' do it.

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:21.995
Talking about
"liberating the QZ"

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.330
is not the same as...

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.206
- Fuck. Where did you even...
- Slow down, slow down.

00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:27.042
I will tell you everything.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.543
But first, you have to
promise me something.

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:31.796
Sort of crazy, and
you're gonna say no,

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.758
but then you have to say yes.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.385
Come with me for a few hours,

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:39.930
and have the best night
of your life.

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:43.183
No.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.393
- Okay, now say yes.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:47.437
It's... Great. It's 2:00 AM.

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:50.566
And in a few hours, I have drills
where we learn to kill Fireflies.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:54.278
Get dressed.

00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:58.366
So stupid.

00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:04.205
- Turn around.
- You're so weird about that.

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:24.432
If you're thinking
about hanging in the park,

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:25.517
we can't go there anymore.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.103
There's a new patrol
that they just put in.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.898
Well... we're not
going to the park.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.607
Okay.

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:35.193
- So where are we going?
- Secret.

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:36.153
Trust me.

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:39.739
You trust me, right?

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.865
I don't know.
Should I trust you?

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:43.035
Of course, you should.
With your life.

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:53.628
- Guards?
- No, 'cause FEDRA's fucking stupid.

00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:56.006
- Ready?
- This better be good.

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.314
Not that fuckin'
stupid, are they?

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:15.316
Okay, rocky start.

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:17.485
Could've been worse, though.

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:20.238
- Could've been a 7-11 situation.
- No thanks.

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:22.699
I'd like to keep my other
eyebrow in one piece.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.159
Well, since you're so interested

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.077
in self-preservation
all of a sudden,

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:28.413
maybe you should stop
fucking with Bethany.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.332
- What's that about?
- Nothing. It's stupid.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.835
She had to get 15 stitches.

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.795
Maybe you shouldn't mess
with people like that.

00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:39.382
I-I'm sorry. Are you, are you
telling me not to beat people up?

00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:41.718
You put Carol in the infirmary
for a fuckin' week.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:45.013
I'm just saying, you can't
fight everything and everyone.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.222
You can pick and choose
what's important.

00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:50.018
Oh, are they teaching you
this at Firefly University?

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:52.520
- Kinda, yeah.
- Hm.

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:55.023
- And fuck Carol.
- Uh-huh.

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:57.734
Fuck Carol... Fucking Carol.

00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:01.572
- Where are we going?
- Through a damn window.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.713
Wow.

00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:22.717
Look at how that water trickles
down those rusty mailboxes.

00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:24.552
This really is the
best night of my life.

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:26.222
- See?
- Yeah.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.850
Firefly lights are better.

00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:33.895
Congrats. One point
for the anarchists.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:37.398
- We prefer freedom fighters.
- Whatever.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:41.819
- How many floors?
- Uh, like two.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.031
What the fuck?

00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:47.159
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:52.248
- Two floors. Fuck you.
- I was a tad bit off.

00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:58.670
Oh, shit.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.755
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:03.383
- Is, is this the big surprise?
- No.

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.928
No, this-this guy
wasn't here yesterday.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.987
So disgusting.

00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:33.205
- Is that real?
- Bottle's real.

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:39.627
This isn't moonshine either.
It's, like, from before.

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:42.088
This guy must've spent every
card he had to get this.

00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:45.301
No one told him he couldn't
mix pills with that shit?

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.095
I think he knew
what he was doing.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.525
You're sick. You know that, right?

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.481
You laughed, too. You're laughing.

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:02.234
Okay, we drinkin' it or what?

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.986
Yeah.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:12.411
Oof.

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:15.038
- Yum.
- Uh-huh. Gimme.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:18.167
Oh, okay.

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:25.841
It's great.

00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:33.766
Was that the first dead body
you ever saw?

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:35.517
No.

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:37.727
My parents.

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:41.481
Yeah. Sorry. I-I know...
I mean, I knew that.

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:44.485
No, it's fine. It's fine. Gimme.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.742
Can I hold your gun?

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.703
Um, they kinda made me swear

00:15:55.704 --> 00:15:57.841
not to let other people
handle my sidearm.

00:15:57.866 --> 00:15:59.332
"Not to handle my sidearm"

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:00.959
"'cause I'm such
a fuckin' Firefly."

00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:06.048
- Give me your gun.
- All right, fine.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.555
It's heavy.

00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:15.683
'Kay.

00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:21.897
Thank you.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.360
So what happened? You started
dating some Firefly dude,

00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:30.071
and was like, "Oh, this is cool.
I think I'll be a terrorist."

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:32.615
Yup. That's it.
We're getting married.

00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:36.912
But really. Why?

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:44.460
Okay, um... one night,
you were in the hole.

00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:46.295
I got bored, so I snuck out.

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:49.799
I was on my way back,
being stealthy like I am.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.801
And this chick
popped outta nowhere.

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:54.638
- Chick, like our age?
- No. Like, 40.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.764
Or 50.

00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:58.474
Whatever. Anyways, old.

00:16:58.475 --> 00:17:02.353
She said she was impressed
watching me sneak around...

00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:04.355
- Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
- ...avoiding guards,

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.441
and she asked
what I thought about FEDRA.

00:17:07.342 --> 00:17:08.442
So I told her the truth.

00:17:08.943 --> 00:17:10.970
They're fascist dickbags,
and they're the ones

00:17:10.995 --> 00:17:13.614
that should be getting hanged for
their crimes, not the people.

00:17:14.115 --> 00:17:15.658
She's like, "All right."

00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:17.585
"If you want in, you're in."

00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:20.371
That's it? No weird initiations?

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:23.166
Nope. I said yes,
and now I'm a Firefly.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:25.460
That easy to give up
everything, huh?

00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:29.469
By "everything," you mean
becoming a fascist dickbag?

00:17:29.494 --> 00:17:32.884
I mean, I don't know
if it's that simple.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:35.511
Like, in a way, FEDRA kinda
holds everything together.

00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:39.391
Ya know, as much as I love arguing
with your stubborn ass...

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:42.853
we're on a mission here.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:20.640
Okay, stop, stop.

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:23.101
Gimme a second. Okay.

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:29.565
Those lights are new.

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:31.192
Yeah, they wired up the
block a couple weeks ago.

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:35.446
You know, more people in the
QZ, so more apartments.

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:37.365
Ah, so FEDRA's not entirely bad.

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:40.506
Mm, fascist dickbags
starving their own population.

00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:43.813
Uh, Fireflies blowing up the
storage depot didn't help.

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:47.959
- Propaganda bullshit.
- Yeah? So you don't bomb stuff anymore?

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.838
- Not when civilians are around.
- That's propaganda bullshit.

00:18:53.631 --> 00:18:56.300
- What?
- One...

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:58.136
it's okay you don't
know everything.

00:18:58.261 --> 00:18:59.587
Agree to disagree.

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:03.225
And two... we're here.

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:13.276
The mall? You out of
your fuckin' mind?

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:16.279
They sealed that place off for a reason.
It's full of Infected.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.197
If it's sealed off, then...

00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:20.367
why isn't it sealed off?

00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:49.437
Oh, it's slimy.

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:52.348
Yeah. I mean, it's been
exposed for a few years.

00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:55.818
So, turns out when FEDRA connected
that block up to the grid,

00:19:55.819 --> 00:19:58.154
this place got connected, too.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.823
Not that they know.

00:20:01.808 --> 00:20:02.908
So what are we doing here?

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.702
Trying to get electrocuted, or...

00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:07.363
- Ow.
- Pay attention.

00:20:07.664 --> 00:20:10.374
You're gonna go through there...
then turn right.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:13.794
- You'll see a door. Go through it. Wait.
- No.

00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:16.130
Fucking turn right,
open the door,

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:17.840
tell me when you're there.

00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:20.134
- Go.
- Fine.

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:21.469
Are you gonna kill me?

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.453
This seems like a
perfect place to do it.

00:20:23.528 --> 00:20:24.571
Oh, I'm aware.

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:46.060
- Are you there?!
- I'm here! Now what?

00:20:46.961 --> 00:20:50.999
Oh, you fucking piece
of shit. Come on.

00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:14.064
So...

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.566
what do you think?

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:18.485
It's...

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:22.905
it's fuckin'... Wait. The lights.

00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:26.367
We're fine. You saw outside.
It's like a big bunker.

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:28.869
No one can see shit but us.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.621
Just me and you.

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:33.040
And you ain't seen nothin' yet.

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:35.459
Tonight, I'm gonna show you

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.087
the four wonders of the mall.

00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:39.423
You planned stuff?

00:21:47.514 --> 00:21:49.598
No way!

00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:51.892
Electric stairs?!

00:21:51.893 --> 00:21:54.229
- Escalator.
- Escalator?

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:57.232
Go ahead.

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.072
No way!

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.702
Check me out, man!
This is so cool!

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.163
Look! Backwards.

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:15.215
Forwards! And backwards!

00:22:15.716 --> 00:22:17.234
And now I'm not goin' anywhere.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.420
I'm not moving!

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:23.090
- So this is the first wonder, right?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:25.718
There can be five wonders
in this mall.

00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:27.261
♪ Take on... ♪

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:30.140
- Whoa!
- Be-be-be careful!

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:33.976
- I'm coming for you. Woo!
- What are you doing?

00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:35.770
- Oh!
- Ooh, shit.

00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:38.272
- Je-Jesus, Ellie.
- No, I'm good.

00:22:38.273 --> 00:22:40.901
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just tripped.

00:22:41.234 --> 00:22:42.777
Okay.

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:45.780
See?

00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:49.158
- Ta-da.
- You are just a graceful ballerina.

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:52.579
- But chop, chop. We're on a schedule.
- Okay.

00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:13.599
Not exactly "full of
Infected," is it?

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.643
Okay, you were right.

00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:17.729
Can we, like, stop and
check some of it out?

00:23:17.754 --> 00:23:20.348
Nope.
Time is of the essence.

00:23:22.484 --> 00:23:24.276
Why are some of these
stores empty and some not?

00:23:24.277 --> 00:23:27.655
My mom said
when the outbreak happened,

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:30.491
people started looting until
the military shut it down,

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:33.369
so the stuff that's gone
is the stuff that people

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.081
needed the most,
or wanted, I guess.

00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:41.210
Right. So... sneakers...

00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:43.462
and not soap.

00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:45.132
Or that shit.

00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:50.702
I mean, I don't get why people
back then wanted all this stuff.

00:23:50.803 --> 00:23:54.389
- Do you need me to explain it to you?
- Ha-ha, no. I know why.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:57.435
- It just... looks uncomfortable.
- Yep.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.855
What?

00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:03.482
Nothing. I was just trying
to imagine you wearing that.

00:24:03.483 --> 00:24:05.944
Shut up.

00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:09.196
All right, come on.

00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:10.615
We're almost there.

00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:23.957
- Ellie!
- Uh-huh, I'm on my way!

00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:38.460
Stop right here.

00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:40.520
Close your eyes.

00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:42.105
- What for?
- Close.

00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:46.984
- Do you trust me?
- With my life, apparently.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:48.695
Oh, well then,
give me your hand.

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.741
Come on.

00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:04.252
Almost there.

00:25:05.962 --> 00:25:10.942
- Now?
- Almost. I said almost.

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:12.886
Okay.

00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:17.641
Open your eyes.

00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:25.732
Shit.

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:38.127
What?

00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:40.038
- No way.
- Yep.

00:26:15.239 --> 00:26:16.983
- What?
- Nothing.

00:26:17.008 --> 00:26:19.118
- You're drunk.
- No.

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.786
- Yes.
- Not yet.

00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:22.706
Gimme.

00:26:32.857 --> 00:26:34.859
- Ya need help?
- No.

00:26:41.057 --> 00:26:43.184
Whew. Yeah.

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:27.436
Oh, come on. Damn it.

00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:28.946
Let me see if I can fix it.

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:34.194
Wait.

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:36.281
Did you really leave
because you actually

00:27:36.306 --> 00:27:37.863
think you could
liberate this place?

00:27:37.864 --> 00:27:40.824
Don't say it like it's some
type of fantasy, Ellie.

00:27:40.825 --> 00:27:43.243
They've done it
in the other QZs.

00:27:43.244 --> 00:27:46.080
Set things right,
the way they used to be.

00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:48.083
Yeah, we could do that, too.

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:50.376
If you come back, I mean.

00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:53.670
We're... we're,
like, the future.

00:27:53.671 --> 00:27:55.881
You know, we could
make things better.

00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:57.508
We could be running things.

00:27:58.509 --> 00:28:02.262
You... could be running things.

00:28:02.263 --> 00:28:03.935
I turn 17 next month.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.194
That's when you get your assignment.

00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:08.517
You know what Kwong gave me?

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:13.274
Sewage detail.

00:28:13.983 --> 00:28:15.026
Fuck.

00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:18.695
Standing guard while
people shovel shit.

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:20.657
That's what they think of me.

00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:25.829
Why didn't you
tell me any of this?

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.623
I don't know.

00:28:29.624 --> 00:28:32.501
I-I just... I panicked.

00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:33.961
And I ran...

00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:36.422
and the longer I was away,

00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:40.134
the harder it was
for me to come back.

00:28:40.135 --> 00:28:42.095
Is that making sense?

00:28:43.263 --> 00:28:44.889
No, I get it.

00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:49.644
I would've gotten it
back then, too, ya know?

00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:53.105
You know, you're the
one thing I missed

00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:55.275
from that fucking place...

00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:59.946
if that makes a difference.

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:04.784
No?

00:29:11.966 --> 00:29:13.216
You know what?

00:29:13.217 --> 00:29:15.009
We're two wonders down...

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.219
three more to go,

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.796
if you wanna keep going.

00:29:17.797 --> 00:29:21.842
I mean, I'm on a magic horse
with, like, a million lights.

00:29:21.843 --> 00:29:23.845
I don't know how it's
supposed to get better.

00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:31.728
Is that a time machine?

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:33.855
Come on.

00:29:42.864 --> 00:29:44.364
Can you be cool like me?

00:29:45.365 --> 00:29:46.742
Strike your best pose!

00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:49.161
Hey, being cool ain't free.

00:29:49.162 --> 00:29:51.580
- Please insert five dollars.
- Oh, fuck you.

00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:54.291
Well, look at that.
I came prepared.

00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:55.751
Have you done this before?

00:29:55.752 --> 00:29:58.796
No, idiot. I was waiting
to do it with you.

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:06.763
- Remember, strike your coolest pose!
- Let's go, bunny.

00:30:10.433 --> 00:30:11.600
Oh shit!

00:30:11.601 --> 00:30:12.893
Uh, what should we do?

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:14.436
- Oh f...
- Lookin' great.

00:30:14.437 --> 00:30:16.396
Um, okay, bunny ears?

00:30:16.397 --> 00:30:18.023
- Wait.
- Say "cheese."

00:30:18.024 --> 00:30:18.816
Find another pose.

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:20.317
- Oh, uh...
- Oh. Uh, back-to-back?

00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:22.694
Yeah.

00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:24.488
Uh, do scary, do scary.

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:25.782
Okay.

00:30:27.742 --> 00:30:29.743
- Time's up. Thanks for all your cool poses.
- Okay, yeah.

00:30:29.744 --> 00:30:31.662
- Get off of me.
- Okay, okay, sorry.

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.997
- I gotcha.
- Your photos are almost done.

00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:38.752
Let's see how ya did.

00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:40.504
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks for hoppin' on by.

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:42.423
There we go.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.384
Oh, fuck.

00:30:47.302 --> 00:30:48.979
That one's not bad.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.808
If you like it, it's yours.

00:31:01.066 --> 00:31:05.061
Come on. We got places to
be and wonders to see.

00:31:05.862 --> 00:31:08.531
Are we going to whatever
number we're up to?

00:31:08.532 --> 00:31:11.518
Fourth wonder of the mall,
and I hope you're prepared

00:31:11.543 --> 00:31:13.620
because it's pretty
dang awesome,

00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:16.123
- and it might break you.
- Uh, don't oversell, man.

00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:17.458
Oop.

00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:21.629
Listen.

00:31:32.473 --> 00:31:33.516
Riley?

00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:36.393
Yeah?

00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:38.980
This is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:42.734
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:32:02.503 --> 00:32:03.670
This is an emergency broadcast.

00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:08.843
The Earth is being invaded
by flying saucers from Mars!

00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:11.011
Ohh, yeah.

00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:11.846
Select a racehorse.

00:32:26.194 --> 00:32:27.278
Do you have any money?

00:32:28.237 --> 00:32:31.740
No, not that
useless shit. Coins.

00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:34.035
We can't even play once.

00:32:41.084 --> 00:32:42.085
You asshole.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:45.087
Yeah, I'm the same asshole
that spent an hour yesterday

00:32:45.088 --> 00:32:47.048
breaking this fucker open.

00:32:49.342 --> 00:32:50.677
Thank you.

00:32:58.518 --> 00:33:00.185
Dude.

00:33:00.186 --> 00:33:02.104
Dude.

00:33:02.105 --> 00:33:03.231
Yeah.

00:33:04.732 --> 00:33:07.429
- Oh, my God.
- Ya ready?

00:33:07.454 --> 00:33:08.760
Yeah.

00:33:19.872 --> 00:33:21.374
Oh, my God.

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:26.670
Raiden. Fuck yeah!

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.839
- Mileena.
- Mileena. Woo-hoo.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.424
Dead Pool.

00:33:30.425 --> 00:33:32.801
- Round one. Fight.
- Uh, wait, how do I play?

00:33:32.802 --> 00:33:34.929
- Smash the buttons.
- There's so many of them.

00:33:38.975 --> 00:33:40.709
- Ooh! Boom.
- Ow!

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.394
- Use the joystick more.
- Okay.

00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:47.941
Ooh! Mileena wins.

00:33:47.942 --> 00:33:49.609
That is such horseshit.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.903
Flawless horseshit. You ready?

00:33:51.904 --> 00:33:54.197
- Round two. Fight.
- No! I'm... Shit.

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:57.493
Okay. Joystick.

00:33:58.619 --> 00:34:01.329
- You're doin' so good!
- How am I doing that?!

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:02.123
Finish him!

00:34:02.124 --> 00:34:04.291
- Finish him!
- Do not finish me.

00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:07.044
But then you wouldn't
get to see this.

00:34:10.798 --> 00:34:13.467
- Ah, fuck!
- Mileena wins.

00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:15.385
- Fatality.
- Fatality.

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:16.803
Okay, that was pretty cool.

00:34:16.804 --> 00:34:18.138
Yeah, I know.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.992
How many times have
you played this?

00:34:20.217 --> 00:34:22.926
I mean, I've... been
here a few times.

00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:26.355
Ah, so you don't wait
to do everything with me.

00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:31.486
Go again?

00:34:32.486 --> 00:34:33.988
Goddamn right.

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:41.203
- Ready?
- Round one. Fight.

00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:44.080
- Uh-uh-uh, not for long.
- Oh. Oh shit.

00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:47.000
- You're cheating!
- I'm not cheating. You're just losing.

00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:49.044
Okay. Just for that. Boom!

00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:50.838
- Oh.
- Oh. Boom!

00:34:51.464 --> 00:34:52.464
Here we go.

00:35:23.496 --> 00:35:25.831
That was a good punch.
I can't lie...

00:35:25.832 --> 00:35:29.209
- Yeah! Gotcha.
- You are beating my ass.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:31.336
Oh! Jesus! Oh!

00:35:31.337 --> 00:35:33.213
- Okay! Now, what do I do?! What do I do?!
- Okay, um, back, forward,

00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:34.924
down, forward, low punch!

00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.433
Oh. Come on.

00:35:45.434 --> 00:35:48.563
Next thing.

00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:57.128
Uh, it's getting late.

00:35:57.153 --> 00:36:00.657
I have to wake up
and make my bed soon.

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:01.909
So...

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.201
We-We still have a few
hours left, though.

00:36:05.326 --> 00:36:07.639
Yeah, I-I just can't
get in trouble again.

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:11.427
But I'll meet you here tomorrow.

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:17.133
I got you a gift.

00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:23.471
I mean... I do like gifts.

00:36:23.472 --> 00:36:24.140
- Is it a spider?
- No.

00:36:24.141 --> 00:36:26.057
- Is it a new shirt?
- No.

00:36:26.058 --> 00:36:27.559
Is it a water pistol?

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.894
- Better.
- Better?!

00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:30.812
- Is it a dinosaur?!
- Possibly.

00:36:30.813 --> 00:36:32.898
I mean, I'll be your best friend
again if it's a dinosaur.

00:36:32.899 --> 00:36:34.274
Oh, really,
my best friend again?

00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:36.943
Ellie, you are already
my best friend.

00:36:36.944 --> 00:36:39.195
Oh, wait, wait.

00:36:39.196 --> 00:36:40.489
Is it tacos?

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.828
Okay... not tacos.

00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:58.340
Is this where
you've been staying?

00:36:58.341 --> 00:36:59.508
Mostly.

00:37:01.093 --> 00:37:04.638
Ta-da! "Volume Too."

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:07.182
Shut up!
They made a second one?!

00:37:07.183 --> 00:37:09.143
Where did you get that?

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:15.565
"What did the frustrated
cannibal do?"

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:17.693
- Lay it on me.
- "He threw up his hands."

00:37:19.528 --> 00:37:20.848
- Gimme. I wanna go. Okay.
- Okay.

00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:28.788
"What did the triangle say
to the circle?"

00:37:29.538 --> 00:37:31.831
- Oh.
- "You're so pointless."

00:37:31.832 --> 00:37:34.834
Okay.

00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:36.753
Okay, um, "How does
a computer get drunk?"

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:40.049
"It takes screenshots."

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:43.259
- What are screenshots?
- I don't actually know.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.554
Okay, gimme.

00:37:46.555 --> 00:37:47.684
Give me a second.

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:58.192
Oh, here we go. "What do you
call an alligator in a vest?"

00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:07.868
Did you make these?

00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:11.789
Yes, Ellie, put it down.

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:15.668
To kill soldiers?

00:38:18.504 --> 00:38:20.338
You didn't find
this mall, did you?

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:21.469
They posted you here.

00:38:21.494 --> 00:38:23.675
A new recruit
guarding their stash?

00:38:23.676 --> 00:38:25.760
We would never use them on you

00:38:25.761 --> 00:38:27.665
or anywhere ever near you.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.889
I would never
let them do that.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.808
You would never let them?

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.936
Right, and you think
they're gonna listen to you?

00:38:40.234 --> 00:38:41.769
I mean, I guess we'll find out.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.029
- Ellie.
- It's okay. I'm going.

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.572
Ellie!

00:38:45.573 --> 00:38:46.699
Ellie?!

00:38:48.742 --> 00:38:49.868
Ellie!

00:38:49.869 --> 00:38:51.327
None of this shit
was even about me!

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:53.079
- Would you stop?
- Fuck you!

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.114
Ellie!

00:38:54.915 --> 00:38:56.384
Ellie, I'm leaving.

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:03.299
They're sending me to a
post in the Atlanta QZ.

00:39:07.553 --> 00:39:12.099
I asked if you could join
so we could go together.

00:39:13.934 --> 00:39:16.164
- But Marlene said no.
- Who the fuck is Marlene?

00:39:16.189 --> 00:39:19.339
Marlene is the lady that helped me get...
It doesn't matter.

00:39:21.858 --> 00:39:22.901
Ellie, I tried.

00:39:25.154 --> 00:39:28.324
Tonight's my last
night in Boston.

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.303
Why did you bring me here?

00:39:53.139 --> 00:39:55.017
Because I wanted to see you.

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:58.646
And?

00:40:00.047 --> 00:40:01.074
And...

00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:13.160
and I wanted to say goodbye.

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:20.417
- This isn't easy, Ellie.
- It actually is.

00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:23.420
You just did it.

00:40:25.755 --> 00:40:27.007
Goodbye.

00:41:19.727 --> 00:41:22.103
Shit.

00:41:22.104 --> 00:41:23.614
Riley?!

00:41:27.026 --> 00:41:28.587
Riley!

00:41:32.947 --> 00:41:34.742
What the fuck?

00:41:38.828 --> 00:41:40.331
Surprise.

00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:45.878
The fifth wonder.

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:49.088
I thought you'd
like this one the best,

00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:51.300
so I saved it for last.

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:55.011
I guess that was stupid.

00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:58.015
- I'm fucking stupid.
- Gimme the book.

00:42:23.707 --> 00:42:24.958
So you leave me.

00:42:24.959 --> 00:42:26.869
I think you're dead.

00:42:29.088 --> 00:42:31.089
All of a sudden, you're alive.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.466
And you give me this night...

00:42:33.467 --> 00:42:35.678
this amazing fucking night.

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.697
And now you're leaving again.

00:42:39.822 --> 00:42:40.848
Forever.

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:44.561
To join some cause I don't
even think you understand.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.856
Tell me I'm wrong.

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:54.947
I think... that you
don't know everything.

00:42:58.492 --> 00:43:02.412
You don't know what it was
like to have a family.

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:04.789
To belong.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.127
I mean, I didn't have them
for long, but I had them.

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:10.796
I belonged to them.

00:43:11.797 --> 00:43:14.674
And I want that again.

00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:17.760
Maybe the Fireflies aren't
what I think they are,

00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:19.930
but they chose me.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.767
I matter to them.

00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:27.438
You mattered to me first.

00:43:29.605 --> 00:43:32.026
Goddamn it, I wanna
punch you so bad.

00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:34.737
If it makes you hate me less.

00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:41.952
And you're sure about this?

00:43:42.786 --> 00:43:43.786
About leaving?

00:43:50.502 --> 00:43:51.628
Yeah.

00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:02.681
Okay.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.268
And I'm not saying it
all pissy and shit.

00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:12.776
You're my best friend...

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.236
and I'll miss you.

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:23.827
Well...

00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:27.790
night's not over yet.

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:30.292
One last thing?

00:44:31.752 --> 00:44:32.878
Sure.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.724
Hey.

00:44:51.105 --> 00:44:52.713
What am I supposed
to do with this?

00:44:53.314 --> 00:44:55.782
- Put it on, stupid.
- But why?

00:44:55.783 --> 00:44:57.493
'Cause it's fun.

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:01.739
And this music sucks.

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:05.201
- You little thief!
- I was definitely,

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:07.412
mm, probably gonna give it back.

00:45:07.413 --> 00:45:09.164

00:47:18.794 --> 00:47:21.004
Uh... what do we do now?

00:47:23.048 --> 00:47:25.425
We're gonna figure it out.

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.475
Get ready to run.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.066
Go! Go! Go!

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.307
Get the fuck off of me!

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:47.174
Holy shit!

00:49:03.732 --> 00:49:04.777
No.

00:49:10.238 --> 00:49:12.156
No, no, no, no, no!

00:49:12.157 --> 00:49:13.742
No!

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:05.419
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:15.553
You motherfucker!
Fuck you! Fuck!

00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:17.848
You mother... Fuck!

00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:26.857
There's more stuff over
there you can break.

00:50:34.406 --> 00:50:36.032
What are we gonna do?

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:39.995
Way I see it,
we got two options.

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:43.123
One...

00:50:44.082 --> 00:50:45.959
we take the easy way out.

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:49.755
It's quick, painless.

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:55.469
No... No, I don't
like option one.

00:50:58.638 --> 00:51:00.223
Option two...

00:51:01.808 --> 00:51:03.894
we just keep going.

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:10.566
What are you talking about, Riley?
It's over.

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:14.987
It will be... but not yet.

00:51:14.988 --> 00:51:19.533
It ends this way for everyone
sooner or later, right?

00:51:19.534 --> 00:51:23.079
Some of us just get there
faster than others.

00:51:25.623 --> 00:51:27.250
But we don't quit.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.464
Whether...

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:35.842
it's two minutes...

00:51:36.802 --> 00:51:38.637
or two days...

00:51:41.097 --> 00:51:44.142
we don't give that up.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:48.313
I don't wanna give that up.

00:51:50.565 --> 00:51:52.566
We can just
be all poetic and shit

00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:54.820
and lose our minds together.

00:51:58.865 --> 00:52:00.742
What's option three?

00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:07.207
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:53:56.565 --> 00:53:58.526
Okay, okay.
