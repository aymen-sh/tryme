00:01.320 --> 00:03.270
Bring him here! Call a doctor!

00:04.260 --> 00:06.600
Don't bother. He's breathed his last.

00:13.290 --> 00:14.730
That makes four.

00:15.310 --> 00:20.240
Kushibe was one of Aizu's finest, 
and they still got him.

00:20.610 --> 00:23.520
What now? We can't keep 
ignoring this, Hirosawa.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.340
Isn't there something we can do?

00:25.520 --> 00:26.720
I know a way.

00:26.930 --> 00:27.580
What?

00:27.760 --> 00:32.220
We'll pit outlaw against outlaw. Bring me...

00:33.330 --> 00:34.530
the Miburo.

00:50.240 --> 00:55.950

02:21.450 --> 02:24.000
Hey, Isami-san! What're you up to?

02:25.620 --> 02:28.120
Filling my lungs with Kyoto air.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.530
What for, sir?

02:30.530 --> 02:33.040
His Imperial Majesty resides in Kyoto.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.960
And now, the shogun, 
Lord Iemochi, is also here.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.440
I feel the air will enhance my samurai aura.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.560
I like the way you think.

02:48.050 --> 02:48.860
Taro-kun?

02:49.750 --> 02:53.560
Serizawa-sensei has an important
 announcement to make.

02:53.790 --> 02:54.960
Serizawa-san does?

02:56.040 --> 02:58.860
Again? Do you think something went wrong?

02:59.160 --> 03:00.520
I wonder.

03:04.450 --> 03:05.660
Oh, there he is.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.670
He's in a good mood?!

03:13.920 --> 03:17.670
E-Excuse me, sir. 
Did something good happen?

03:17.670 --> 03:20.800
Something good? As if you don't know.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.050
As I'm sure Sir Kondo has already told you,

03:26.520 --> 03:32.020
The Aizu Domain has extended a 
formal offer to enlist the Mibu Roshigumi.

03:32.770 --> 03:35.680
Now, it's time we all paid 
the lord of Aizu our respects.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.690
Yes. That was the plan.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.150
First I'm hearing of it!

03:40.150 --> 03:41.560
You didn't tell us anything!

03:41.560 --> 03:43.470
You always do this!

03:43.780 --> 03:46.800
Aizu? That <i>is</i> good news.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.640
But I wonder what the townsfolk will think.

03:49.640 --> 03:53.790
Um, I'm pretty sure 
Aizu is well-liked in Kyoto.

03:53.790 --> 03:54.420
Huh?

03:54.420 --> 03:55.290
You mean it?

03:55.530 --> 04:00.040
Everyone celebrated when an 
Aizu party came last year.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.720
Granny, my sister, and I went out
 to the bridge to see them.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.730
Oh! It's good to have a local!

04:05.730 --> 04:06.800
You sure come in handy!

04:08.260 --> 04:11.800
And Serizawa-sensei made this all possible!

04:11.800 --> 04:13.520
There you have it.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.520
Excuse me, but please wait a moment.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.400
Sir Yamanami? What's wrong?

04:24.700 --> 04:26.820
I'd like to be clear. Do you mind?

04:27.380 --> 04:28.400
Ask away.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.800
Kyoto is still caught in a storm
 of sonno joi sentiment.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.800
We all know that.

04:35.110 --> 04:35.790
Um...

04:36.200 --> 04:36.610
Hm?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.240
Excuse me, Yamanami-san.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.670
What is "sonno joi"?

04:43.220 --> 04:45.270
You mean you don't even know <i>that?</i>

04:45.450 --> 04:49.010
I hear the words often, 
but I don't really understand them.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.220
It's a good question.

04:51.650 --> 04:55.310
"Sonno" is reverence of
the Emperor here in Kyoto.

04:55.310 --> 05:00.040
"Joi" expresses the sentiment that we should
 expel foreigners who disturb our country.

05:00.870 --> 05:01.730
I see.

05:02.040 --> 05:06.740
So "sonno joi" basically means "respect 
His Imperial Majesty and keep foreigners out."

05:07.810 --> 05:13.000
But wait, doesn't that mean 
<i>most</i> people want sonno joi?

05:14.610 --> 05:15.870
What are you talking about?

05:16.120 --> 05:17.710
Well spotted.

05:17.710 --> 05:19.910
Yes. That's exactly the problem.

05:19.910 --> 05:20.580
Huh?

05:20.960 --> 05:24.200
You see, sonno joi comes in many forms.

05:24.130 --> 05:31.810
<b>Sonno joi</b>

05:24.130 --> 05:31.810
<b>Anti-shogunate</b>

05:24.130 --> 05:31.810
<b>Choshu</b>

05:24.130 --> 05:31.810
<b>Pro-shogunate</b>

05:24.130 --> 05:31.810
<b>Aizu</b>

05:25.300 --> 05:28.120
For example, Aizu is pro-shogunate.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.810
They revere the Emperor and want to expel 
barbarians while siding with the Shogun.

05:32.390 --> 05:34.560
We came here for the same reason.

05:34.560 --> 05:40.940
<b>Sonno joi</b>

05:34.560 --> 05:40.940
<b>Anti-shogunate</b>

05:34.560 --> 05:40.940
<b>Choshu</b>

05:34.560 --> 05:40.940
<b>Pro-shogunate</b>

05:34.560 --> 05:40.940
<b>Aizu</b>

05:35.360 --> 05:40.950
The Choshu, meanwhile, advocates sonno joi 
while staying anti-shogunate to the core.

05:41.390 --> 05:44.240
Their view has the strongest 
influence in Kyoto now.

05:44.240 --> 05:47.900
Anti-shogunate? So some people
 don't want the Shogun in charge,

05:47.900 --> 05:50.320
and that's their idea of justice?

05:50.950 --> 05:53.080
I wish we could all just get along.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.600
Yes, so do I.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.320
But their beliefs aren't the issue.

05:59.800 --> 06:05.460
The problem is that some will do anything, 
even kill, to bend the world to their vision.

06:08.050 --> 06:11.430
The townspeople are honestly sick of them.

06:12.090 --> 06:16.480
We have to bar our doors and windows
 in fear, even on hot summer nights.

06:18.690 --> 06:21.160
We just want to walk 
where we like and be happy.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.190
So why?

06:23.440 --> 06:26.240
Why does only our city 
have to suffer like this?

06:26.720 --> 06:29.700
The current emperor dislikes foreigners.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.240
People want to take advantage of that.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.990
Huh? <i>That's</i> the whole reason?

06:35.700 --> 06:40.000
Lord Tokugawa Iemochi has already 
ensconced himself in Kyoto's Nijo Castle.

06:40.330 --> 06:45.370
Rumor has it the extremists plotting 
his death number 500 or more.

06:45.550 --> 06:47.210
W-Wait, 500?

06:47.210 --> 06:49.420
Yeah? So what?

06:50.840 --> 06:54.560
So my question is: 
are you prepared to risk your lives?

06:54.560 --> 06:59.180
We're ronin! Easy to use and abuse! 
Aizu sees us as no more than sacrificial pawns!

06:59.440 --> 07:01.690
And we won't like every job they give us!

07:01.690 --> 07:03.990
Of course we'll get their dirty work!

07:04.190 --> 07:07.440
Can you still put your lives
 on the line? Well?!

07:07.650 --> 07:09.870
H-Has he got a split personality?

07:10.740 --> 07:14.540
<i>Am I ready to die? Really ready?</i>

07:15.020 --> 07:18.170
<i>Can I say for sure that I won't 
lose my nerve in the face of death?</i>

07:24.230 --> 07:25.290
I can!

07:25.930 --> 07:27.120
Kondo-san!

07:27.600 --> 07:31.140
Sounds like fun. I say we all join in.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.260
Okita-san!

07:34.120 --> 07:36.800
You waited till <i>now</i> to ask?

07:36.800 --> 07:38.930
Yes. There's only one road ahead.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.310
We're with you.

07:40.310 --> 07:41.680
Damn right we are.

07:42.620 --> 07:46.060
Anyone who can't say that wouldn't be here.

07:47.180 --> 07:50.440
Men, follow me.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.200
So much for trying to rattle them.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.330
No. This is what I've been waiting for.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.330
<i>I knew these guys were cool!</i>

08:04.280 --> 08:05.710
I'm with you, too!

08:06.010 --> 08:10.710
Huh? Then, um, so am I, if you'll have me.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.340
We, the Mibu Roshigumi, 
share one purpose: to defend Kyoto!

08:18.730 --> 08:20.940
March.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.460
All right! Let's go!

08:33.200 --> 08:35.400
It itches. Why's it so scratchy?

08:35.400 --> 08:38.570
Come on, Hijikata-san.
We need you to walk tall like Kondo-san.

08:38.570 --> 08:40.200
Quiet, Soji.

08:40.730 --> 08:42.420
Think we'll get some choice grub?

08:46.180 --> 08:51.160
Everyone's excited to meet a big shot 
like the lord of Aizu, huh, Hajime-kun?

08:52.080 --> 08:52.920
Idiots.

08:52.920 --> 08:53.350
Huh?

08:54.040 --> 08:58.260
It doesn't matter who we serve
as long as we live like samurai.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.560
Am I wrong?

09:02.810 --> 09:05.560
<b>Commissioner of Kyoto
Lord Matsudaira Higo-no-Kami of Aizu</b>

09:08.560 --> 09:12.810
So this is Aizu's headquarters 
in Kyoto? That's some mansion.

09:15.570 --> 09:16.860
Enjoy yourselves, sirs.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.330
Aren't you coming in, Taro?

09:19.730 --> 09:21.950
Dressed like this? How could I?

09:22.160 --> 09:26.050
Forget him. We don't want him 
pissing anyone off, anyway.

09:26.050 --> 09:27.100
Hm...

09:28.360 --> 09:31.280
Then I won't go, either.
 Let's wait out here together.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.590
Well, you <i>are</i> a kid.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.250
He <i>is</i> a kid.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.350
He sure is.

09:37.350 --> 09:38.400
Huh?

09:39.440 --> 09:42.220
Wow. What pretty stones.

09:42.220 --> 09:44.360
Are you nuts? Don't play with them.

09:44.690 --> 09:48.240
Just look at them. I wish I could 
show these to Granny and Iroha.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.890
Don't you dare take them!

09:50.280 --> 09:52.360
Why do I have to stay out here, too?!

09:52.540 --> 09:55.920
Huh? What are kids doing here?

09:57.800 --> 10:00.490
This compound belongs 
to Matsudaira Katamori.

10:00.490 --> 10:02.570
You can't just wander in uninvited.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.080
Look at his hair.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.340
It's the Golden Pavilion!

10:08.340 --> 10:11.470
Oh, this? My ma came from foreign parts.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.760
I hear my pa got an Englishwoman with child.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.760
She went back to her own country, though.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.780
You must be lonely.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.920
Don't you want to go visit your mother?

10:22.170 --> 10:24.020
Not even a little.

10:24.020 --> 10:26.150
My family are big-name fabric dealers.

10:26.750 --> 10:30.090
Every day is bustling, 
and everyone's nice to me.

10:30.440 --> 10:33.510
And above all, I like this city.

10:33.780 --> 10:36.030
I've got everything I could want.

10:36.480 --> 10:41.160
I've come to pay my respects because
 we received an order for a new kimono.

10:41.160 --> 10:46.450
Bah! This rich kid hasn't suffered a day
 in his life. Who asked for his life story?

10:46.690 --> 10:48.900
We're here at the 
invitation of the Aizu Domain.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.080
We're the Miburo... 
members of the Mibu Roshigumi.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.300
Oh, the Miburo? I've heard of you.

10:55.620 --> 11:00.320
A bunch of rowdy ronin from Edo 
that nobody here can stand, right?

11:01.260 --> 11:04.160
No, that's a bit of a misunderstanding.

11:04.500 --> 11:08.260
We're really working 
to make Kyoto a safer place.

11:08.260 --> 11:11.600
Really? I had no idea.

11:11.840 --> 11:17.280
Still, if they've called in tough samurai, 
it must be because of you-know-what.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.500
What do you mean?

11:19.280 --> 11:22.150
Oh, never mind. Forget I said anything.

11:22.150 --> 11:26.120
Anyway, it takes a special kind of person 
to come guard somebody else's city.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.080
Young master, we should be going.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.500
Oh, you're right. We'd better head back.

11:31.070 --> 11:35.310
My family runs Tsuruya on Nijo-dori. 
We get all sorts there.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.840
Huh? Oh, okay.

11:38.510 --> 11:42.930
My name's Seto. Come see me if you're
 ever in the market for information.

11:43.370 --> 11:43.940
Bye.

11:44.780 --> 11:48.120
My name's Nio. See you, Seto-kun.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.170
He was pretty friendly, don't you think?

11:55.170 --> 11:56.050
In what universe?

11:57.490 --> 12:00.200
<i>He had a faint scent blood on him.</i>

12:07.290 --> 12:08.960
Raise your heads.

12:11.040 --> 12:15.720
I am Matsudaira Katamori, 
Commissioner of Kyoto and Lord of Aizu.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.960
By order of the Emperor and the Shogun,

12:18.960 --> 12:23.720
I have come from my domain 
to keep the peace here in our capital.

12:23.900 --> 12:24.850
Sir.

12:24.850 --> 12:29.720
You did well to travel here 
from Edo to defend the Shogun.

12:29.880 --> 12:30.400
Sir.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.110
We...

12:32.360 --> 12:35.720
We came from Edo with 234 brave men.

12:36.100 --> 12:41.430
Yet Kiyokawa Hachiro, who proposed the plan, 
contrived to turn most back to Edo.

12:41.430 --> 12:43.320
Only 15 of us remained.

12:43.760 --> 12:47.080
The storm of sonno joi has raged 
since the coming of the Black Ships.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.280
A foreigner was cut down 
at Namamugi last year,

12:49.280 --> 12:53.280
and here in Kyoto, assassins kill 
in the name of "heaven's justice."

12:53.660 --> 12:58.680
We wish only to defend 
Kyoto as you do, my lord.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.960
Yet we came with nothing
 but our conviction.

13:02.180 --> 13:06.760
To our shame, with no stipends of our own, 
we now presume on the Yagis' kindness.

13:06.760 --> 13:12.750
We hope to offer our utmost 
not in passing, but in perpetuity.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.160
<i>He wrote the whole speech on his hands.</i>

13:13.390 --> 13:18.940
Thus, we have come to beg 
Your Lordship for support.

13:22.030 --> 13:27.480
If I had my way, I'd go home 
to a peaceful life in Aizu this instant!

13:32.480 --> 13:34.980
This is a temple, a place for Buddhas.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.480
I'll tell no lies here, 
so be frank with me as well.

13:40.490 --> 13:44.510
I want to become a samurai in body and soul!

13:49.200 --> 13:51.310
I want to fight strong guys!

13:51.310 --> 13:53.960
I want to laze around all day!

13:53.960 --> 13:56.250
I wish to master the blade!

13:56.250 --> 13:58.730
I want women to throw themselves at me!

13:58.730 --> 14:00.240
I want to get ahead!

14:00.240 --> 14:02.920
I want to eat the finest food!

14:02.920 --> 14:06.240
I want to debate as many people as I can!

14:02.920 --> 14:06.240
You all dream small!

14:08.110 --> 14:10.220
What delightful fellows!

14:10.220 --> 14:11.240
My lord.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.560
Hm? You there.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.040
Tell me what you really want.

14:19.140 --> 14:21.560
I have nothing to hide.

14:22.270 --> 14:25.250
Kondo's speech summed up my thoughts.

14:26.220 --> 14:30.400
I want to sweep the trash 
from this city, nothing more.

14:34.270 --> 14:35.090
What a man!

14:35.090 --> 14:36.690
That's our Hijikata-san.

14:36.690 --> 14:38.060
Hey! Quit it!

14:39.410 --> 14:41.720
Very good. I like you.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.440
What a funny lord.

14:47.610 --> 14:51.580
Gentlemen of the Roshigumi, 
I have something I'd like you to see.

14:51.580 --> 14:52.700
Follow me.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.080
Who's this?

14:59.080 --> 15:02.590
The fourth Aizu man cut down on the street.

15:06.190 --> 15:10.310
Every victim had his eyes 
ripped out, as you see here.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.010
Why would anyone do that?

15:12.710 --> 15:17.560
He relayed the killer's words 
to us just before he passed:

15:18.640 --> 15:23.870
"Are you Aizu dogs blind? 
The five of us will see heaven's justice done."

15:24.930 --> 15:26.280
I have a request.

15:27.030 --> 15:29.270
Please hunt down these five devils,

15:30.040 --> 15:32.660
and send them to their graves.

15:35.430 --> 15:36.520
Their <i>eyes?</i>

15:37.780 --> 15:40.620
How could anyone do 
something so awful? They'll pay.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.880
First, we need information.

15:43.120 --> 15:47.040
What they look like, when they strike, 
how they operate, anything.

15:47.190 --> 15:48.360
Information...

15:49.920 --> 15:51.800
Do you have an idea?

15:51.800 --> 15:54.170
Oh, no, nothing definite.

15:54.780 --> 15:55.680
Tell us.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.180
The kid knows?

16:00.180 --> 16:01.180
Are you serious?

16:01.970 --> 16:02.900
A child?

16:02.900 --> 16:06.680
Y-You can't trust that guy. 
Especially his looks.

16:06.680 --> 16:10.110
No, we shouldn't judge him
 by his appearance.

16:10.110 --> 16:13.200
Well then, Nio-kun, 
we'll leave that to you boys.

16:13.200 --> 16:13.670
Yes, sir.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.360
C-Count me out!

16:17.520 --> 16:18.500
We're wasting time.

16:21.160 --> 16:24.110
I know the enemy will target me.

16:24.410 --> 16:28.000
All I need to do is take a walk, 
and they'll come to me.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.500
H-How can you be so sure?

16:30.500 --> 16:32.000
How?

16:32.190 --> 16:36.700
Because anyone can see that I, Serizawa Kamo,
 am a force to be reckoned with!

16:36.920 --> 16:38.620
They can't ignore me.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.710
Taro-kun, do you have a moment?

16:49.920 --> 16:50.780
Yes, sir.

16:51.380 --> 16:52.940
What will you do, Hajime-kun?

16:52.940 --> 16:56.060
He said Tsuruya on Nijo-dori, right? 
What are we waiting for?

17:01.700 --> 17:03.620
Wow, what a surprise.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.320
I never imagined you'd 
come straight here today.

17:07.320 --> 17:10.180
Sorry for barging in on you
 so suddenly, Seto-kun.

17:10.180 --> 17:11.380
Oh, it's no trouble.

17:11.850 --> 17:14.300
I can't offer you a
 quiet place to talk, though.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.480
This is a nice shop.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.210
Sure is, although 
it's getting long in the tooth.

17:19.530 --> 17:22.720
The walls are plastered. 
Pretty color, don't you think?

17:22.720 --> 17:24.580
No, I didn't mean that.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.720
This is what you call 
"storefront sales," right?

17:27.960 --> 17:32.230
You set out your wares in front of the shop 
and let your customers choose.

17:32.710 --> 17:35.910
They're so colorful that 
they feel excited just coming here.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.200
You sure know a lot.

17:38.770 --> 17:42.460
I learned by helping out 
at my granny's dango shop.

17:42.460 --> 17:44.680
It's called Chirinuya. 
Have you heard of it?

17:44.680 --> 17:46.250
Yup, I know the place.

17:47.070 --> 17:50.770
Every customer here
 looks genuinely happy.

17:51.220 --> 17:53.720
They're all engrossed 
in picking what to buy.

17:54.450 --> 17:57.640
So if you ask me, 
this really is a nice shop.

17:59.460 --> 18:02.130
Thanks. I'm glad to hear you say so.

18:04.030 --> 18:07.140
I thought all you Miburo came from Edo.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.120
All the grownups did,

18:09.470 --> 18:12.610
but we three kids were born in Kyoto.

18:12.610 --> 18:16.420
Oh, so that's it. 
That makes us four of a kind.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.970
Now, let me guess.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.530
You're here about the
 murdered Aizu samurai.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.080
Yes.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.080
It started after the lord of Aizu moved in.

18:28.360 --> 18:32.620
Someone killed a samurai on his way home 
from Shimabara and took his eyes.

18:33.190 --> 18:34.880
There has to be a grudge behind it.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.090
A grudge?

18:37.320 --> 18:38.760
That's no excuse, though.

18:39.010 --> 18:41.520
Whatever their reasons, 
they've gone too far.

18:42.530 --> 18:43.010
Yes.

18:45.270 --> 18:47.180
Huh. That's a surprise.

18:47.480 --> 18:50.010
I figured you'd get angrier.

18:50.010 --> 18:52.270
Really? I mean, I am angry, of course.

18:52.550 --> 18:53.770
You don't look it.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.180
Is that all?

18:55.770 --> 18:58.870
Oh, I know where the killings happened, too.

19:02.140 --> 19:05.240
On this map... it'd be around here.

19:05.560 --> 19:08.420
I see. They're mostly near the Kamo River.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.320
We're wasting time. I'm leaving.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.910
Anyway, it's a real mess.

19:15.910 --> 19:16.360
Huh?

19:16.860 --> 19:21.400
I shouldn't have to tell you three, 
but this city's in bad shape.

19:22.010 --> 19:24.090
People are flocking here from all over.

19:25.670 --> 19:29.680
Choshu or Aizu, extremists 
or Miburo, it's all the same.

19:30.010 --> 19:31.420
They're all outsiders.

19:32.850 --> 19:35.270
Hey, what do you say we chase them off?

19:35.760 --> 19:37.750
Cockroaches, every one of them.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.450
I'll work with you to keep this city safe.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.140
Thank you. But...

19:47.720 --> 19:51.190
I only hope that's enough 
to bring peace to the city.

19:55.730 --> 19:56.540
Yes.

19:58.180 --> 19:59.360
So do I.

20:02.210 --> 20:05.010
He said we'd better go this way, 
since it's getting dark.

20:07.310 --> 20:08.770
What did you think, Hajime-kun?

20:10.520 --> 20:13.260
Hmph. What did <i>you</i> think?

20:14.160 --> 20:17.520
Well, Seto-kun's pretty fishy.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.260
When did you catch on?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.520
Well, from the start.

20:23.880 --> 20:28.520
The way he was talking, 
it felt like he was leading us along.

20:29.380 --> 20:32.200
Seeing him again made me sure of it.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.310
He's suspicious.

20:34.820 --> 20:35.620
Right.

20:37.640 --> 20:38.500
Should we kill him?

20:38.750 --> 20:39.910
Hm...

20:40.510 --> 20:44.780
No. I'd like to have 
one more honest talk with him.

20:47.030 --> 20:50.040
You never make any sense.

20:50.670 --> 20:51.870
You think so?

21:01.160 --> 21:01.860
<i>An umbrella.</i>

21:10.530 --> 21:11.330
<i>Will he strike?</i>

21:30.640 --> 21:32.300
It's a good thing we had our guards up.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.690
We may be kids, but we're not easy prey.

21:38.990 --> 21:40.750
I pity you children.

21:44.910 --> 21:49.910
<b>United</b>

21:44.910 --> 21:49.910
<b>in
Purpose</b>

23:20.040 --> 23:25.460
<b>Next time</b>

23:22.370 --> 23:23.710
Saito Hajime here.

23:24.330 --> 23:28.440
I was out with Nio when we ran 
into the guy behind the killings.

23:28.960 --> 23:32.050
Who the hell is he, anyway?

23:32.670 --> 23:35.810
His first strike proves he knows 
how to use a sword, but that's it.

23:36.900 --> 23:41.100
There's no backing out now. 
Our only choice is to fight.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.700
Let's get him, Nio!

23:43.840 --> 23:46.130
Next time: "To Each His Own Justice."

23:46.590 --> 23:47.990
Don't you dare miss it.

23:47.070 --> 23:49.910
<b>To
Each</b>

23:47.070 --> 23:49.910
<b>His Own
Justice</b>
