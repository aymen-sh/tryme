WEBVTT

00:09.180 --> 00:11.870
Ugh. I'm getting sleepy.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.030
It's so cold at night.

00:14.320 --> 00:19.060
And how am I supposed to spot 
suspicious people in this crowd?

00:19.480 --> 00:20.670
Maybe I oughta give up.

00:21.330 --> 00:24.440
I mean, they might k-kill me 
if they catch me.

00:24.750 --> 00:25.720
Good work.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.290
What was the point of hiding 
if you give us away now?

00:30.690 --> 00:32.360
I'll wait outside.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.550
You'll never get anything 
out of him with me there.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.520
Yes, I agree.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.560
Oh, hey. You've got a proper sword now.

00:40.980 --> 00:44.820
I doubt he's gotten his own hands
 bloody with these murders,

00:45.510 --> 00:47.190
but if you can, bring back proof.

00:47.510 --> 00:48.080
Yes, sir.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.230
What?

00:51.070 --> 00:53.150
A-Are you sure about this?

00:53.380 --> 00:57.980
I staked out the place all night and 
didn't see anyone shady go in or out.

00:57.980 --> 01:00.940
Is he really mixed up in this mess?

01:00.940 --> 01:03.710
Yes, he is. Now, let's get going.

01:04.820 --> 01:06.590
Y-Yeah?

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:20.180 --> 01:25.890
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:38.710 --> 02:41.090
Welcome, Nio-kun, Taro-kun.

02:41.470 --> 02:44.590
I'm glad you came. I've been waiting.

02:45.770 --> 02:49.430
I have some nibbles ready. Please, come in.

02:49.690 --> 02:54.600
Hey, this guy seems awfully sure of himself.
 You sure about this? Tread carefully.

02:55.180 --> 02:56.600
I'll cut to the chase.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.040
You had us attacked last night, didn't you?

03:01.260 --> 03:02.490
<i>Zero subtlety!</i>

03:02.920 --> 03:05.420
What? Someone attacked you?

03:05.420 --> 03:06.730
Are you hurt?

03:06.730 --> 03:09.090
Oh, don't bother putting on an act.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.670
Hijikata-san gave me this earlier.

03:12.190 --> 03:14.880
Our attacker, Jutaro-san, 
was carrying this paper.

03:15.260 --> 03:20.880
<b>Two children
going south along
the canal

Miburo</b>

03:15.780 --> 03:20.880
It says, "Two children going south
 along the canal. Miburo."

03:23.120 --> 03:27.440
So it does. But what makes
 you think I wrote that?

03:27.640 --> 03:28.560
Do we have to?

03:28.830 --> 03:30.060
Don't be silly.

03:30.060 --> 03:32.560
<i>They just started bargaining
 way over my head!</i>

03:32.880 --> 03:38.200
Tell me. Were you attacked 
right after you left me here?

03:38.610 --> 03:39.560
That's right.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.710
Do you honestly think I ran ahead 
of you to deliver that message?

03:44.120 --> 03:47.460
I'm not proud of it, 
but I'm an awfully slow runner.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.120
Right.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.840
But if you refold this paper
 along the creases...

03:54.360 --> 03:56.720
Look how thin it ends up.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.920
Almost like it was tied to something.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.380
What do you mean?

04:07.750 --> 04:09.300
You used a pigeon, didn't you?

04:10.260 --> 04:12.180
Oh, of course! Carrier pigeons!

04:12.640 --> 04:15.390
You could deliver the message
 without going anywhere.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.180
And it's faster than a person.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.790
Wow. How'd you figure it out?

04:20.790 --> 04:22.070
He admitted it!

04:22.720 --> 04:26.000
I saw pigeons on the roof 
across the street when I was last here.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.840
It got me wondering.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.840
Oh, so you noticed that.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.500
<i>Nothing gets past him!</i>

04:31.800 --> 04:35.460
Wait, b-but is he allowed 
to just send out carrier pigeons?

04:35.950 --> 04:39.130
I doubt it. The Shogunate has a ban on them.

04:39.690 --> 04:41.960
They'd haul me off to jail 
if they caught me.

04:44.210 --> 04:46.560
You lose, Golden Pavilion Head.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.470
So, where's your proof?

04:50.430 --> 04:52.980
What do you get from it, Seto-kun?

04:54.890 --> 04:58.570
I've been thinking about it, 
but I just can't figure it out.

05:01.490 --> 05:04.320
Those people sincerely 
despise the Shogunate,

05:04.610 --> 05:08.620
along with its Aizu supporters 
and their Miburo agents.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.100
What's so wrong about passing 
information to people who want it?

05:13.100 --> 05:14.580
They sounded grateful.

05:14.780 --> 05:18.000
I... I get it! You must be 
making a fortune off all the info!

05:18.520 --> 05:21.130
No, I don't take a single mon.

05:22.270 --> 05:24.960
Wh-Why do you do it, then?

05:25.610 --> 05:28.240
Is it wrong to hurt people?

05:28.680 --> 05:30.720
Does loving people earn you praise?

05:33.640 --> 05:35.480
Do you know the answer, Nio-kun?

05:37.840 --> 05:39.720
No, I don't.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.700
I'm sure you don't. 
This world is full of nonsense.

05:43.970 --> 05:44.990
Such as?

05:45.360 --> 05:47.270
Such as, let's see...

05:47.520 --> 05:50.240
Think about a person's whole life.

05:50.990 --> 05:54.560
Your family and the order 
you're born in determines your future.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.960
Everyone knows that, 
but doesn't it seem strange?

05:58.540 --> 06:00.910
If you're born to a farm family, 
you become a farmer.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.960
Samurai children become samurai;
merchants, merchants.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.640
Eldest sons must succeed their fathers.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.480
Younger sons spend 
their whole lives as dependents.

06:09.720 --> 06:14.470
Only doctors, swordsmen, 
and scholars can ever break free.

06:14.930 --> 06:18.700
But unfortunately, I have 
no interest in being any of those.

06:19.780 --> 06:24.110
Gimme a break! What have <i>you</i> got to complain
 about when your family runs this huge shop?

06:24.600 --> 06:26.930
I see you lack imagination.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.620
Big or small, everyone has 
something to complain about.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.060
What do I want to do?

06:33.400 --> 06:34.840
Nothing, really.

06:36.880 --> 06:40.280
It's all good fun. Just a little prank.

06:43.710 --> 06:47.560
But it stops being "just a prank" 
when people get hurt.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.560
I won't let you keep this up 
and get away with it.

06:55.660 --> 06:58.560
I give up. How stubborn can you get?

06:58.950 --> 07:04.180
Y-Yeah! I'll be watching those pigeons 
to make sure you don't try anything!

07:04.180 --> 07:06.050
Fine, fine.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.820
I'll drop the whole business.

07:07.820 --> 07:09.310
R-Really?

07:09.310 --> 07:11.570
Really. I'll prove it.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.030
This is what you want, right?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.460
It's a list of the inns 
those guys like to stay at.

07:18.890 --> 07:20.490
All right! Way to go, Nio!

07:20.680 --> 07:21.340
Keep it.

07:21.870 --> 07:23.220
Why?!

07:23.220 --> 07:24.490
It doesn't sit right.

07:24.490 --> 07:25.380
Don't be a child!

07:25.930 --> 07:30.140
Are you sure? They won't give up just 
because I've stopped working with them.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.470
We'll find them without that paper.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.260
Every Miburo is looking 
high and low as we speak.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.210
Not exactly efficient.

07:42.210 --> 07:43.140
That's fine!

07:43.950 --> 07:47.370
Now that we've settled that, 
Taro-kun, let's go join them.

07:47.370 --> 07:49.840
Why?! Are you stupid?!

07:49.840 --> 07:51.150
Nio! Taro!

07:51.640 --> 07:54.660
We just got a tip about 
the inn they're at. Wrap it up.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.000
They found them <i>already?</i>

07:59.780 --> 08:02.450
See? Aren't the Miburo something?

08:02.450 --> 08:03.680
Get a move on!

08:03.680 --> 08:05.190
Yes, sir. We'll be right there.

08:05.910 --> 08:06.720
Nio-kun.

08:07.450 --> 08:10.470
Have you changed a little since yesterday?

08:11.720 --> 08:14.890
You're actually furious, aren't you?

08:17.360 --> 08:22.520
Deep down, you just can't stand outsiders 
riding roughshod over your hometown.

08:23.250 --> 08:26.890
So you leaked information, 
hoping we'd kill each other.

08:27.940 --> 08:31.400
What you said earlier is just 
a front you put up for people.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.660
As if. I don't know 
what you're talking about.

08:35.630 --> 08:37.840
Nio! What's taking you? Let's go!

08:37.840 --> 08:39.000
Oh, right.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.400
Bye, Seto-kun. See you later.

08:40.760 --> 08:41.870
Hurry up.

08:41.870 --> 08:43.910
You're so impatient, Taro-kun.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.100
Nio...

08:50.140 --> 08:51.920
You're a funny one.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.600
I hear they've been in and out of this inn.

08:59.600 --> 09:03.010
It's broad daylight now. They may be out.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.770
There are four left.

09:05.150 --> 09:05.800
Yeah.

09:06.060 --> 09:09.240
There were five, but Soji already slit one open.

09:11.250 --> 09:11.870
We go in.

09:11.870 --> 09:12.940
Hey!

09:13.200 --> 09:14.930
Oh, it's Nio and the others.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.580
We made it in time.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.320
Yes. We're all here now.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.450
I'm gonna die.

09:19.740 --> 09:20.640
Kondo-san.

09:20.840 --> 09:21.960
I know.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.510
We aren't here to kill.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.360
Take them alive if you can.

09:26.640 --> 09:30.470
We'll hear them out and 
make them pay for their crimes.

09:30.780 --> 09:31.270
Yes, sir.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.970
Hara-san and I will guard the back door.

09:35.150 --> 09:35.690
Good.

09:36.270 --> 09:36.970
Let's move.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.680
Yeah!

09:39.700 --> 09:40.600
Follow me.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.830
That's the wrong way!

09:41.830 --> 09:42.730
Turn around!

09:42.720 --> 09:44.730
<b>Mizutaya Inn</b>

09:46.390 --> 09:49.720
We have heard that outlaws 
have gone to ground in this inn.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.790
Please evacuate at once! 
They may be dangerous!

09:52.790 --> 09:54.450
We'll search the first floor.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.250
I'll take the second.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.760
Oh, please have mercy!

09:58.760 --> 10:01.970
I can't have you waving 
swords around in my rooms.

10:01.970 --> 10:04.240
What if you hurt the other guests?

10:06.920 --> 10:08.160
Please, samurai.

10:08.160 --> 10:08.950
Kondo-san.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.750
Very well, ma'am.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.240
We won't swing our swords. You have my word.

10:17.840 --> 10:22.260
I think the guests in the back room
 go in and out at night.

10:22.820 --> 10:23.520
So this is it!

10:27.520 --> 10:28.320
Oh?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.190
Are you looking for someone?

10:34.020 --> 10:36.030
<b>Mizutaya Inn</b>

10:40.540 --> 10:43.720
I see. You've come all the way from Edo.

10:44.130 --> 10:46.930
I'm an Aizu man myself.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.820
Aizu, you say? What a coincidence.

10:49.820 --> 10:52.040
<i>Why are we sipping tea
 with some old geezer?!</i>

10:52.270 --> 10:57.790
By the way, samurai, have you had
 much practice with the sword?

10:58.170 --> 11:03.670
Yes. It's all I'm good at, so I swing
 my blade from dawn till dusk.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.140
I guess swordsmanship 
really does take practice.

11:07.140 --> 11:08.300
Of course it does.

11:09.550 --> 11:10.850
<i>He's going along with it!</i>

11:10.860 --> 11:12.860
<b>Mizutaya Inn</b>

11:13.000 --> 11:13.850
What?

11:14.340 --> 11:18.370
You ran a dojo in Edo? 
Did these lads train with you there?

11:18.650 --> 11:22.870
No, these boys joined us in Kyoto.

11:23.570 --> 11:25.410
You must be quite a famous—

11:25.410 --> 11:28.320
Oh, no. It was only a small dojo.

11:28.790 --> 11:33.120
My wife struggled to make ends meet 
when we had a lot of mouths to feed.

11:36.170 --> 11:37.880
<i>He's married?!</i>

11:38.280 --> 11:40.260
And our child is still a baby.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.760
<i>He even has a kid!</i>

11:42.050 --> 11:45.520
Dear, me. You certainly must have struggled.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.520
No, it never bothered me.

11:50.430 --> 11:51.480
It was the sandals.

11:52.320 --> 11:57.770
Seeing more and more sandals in our 
entry hall made me happy. I can't say why.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.520
I couldn't help grinning 
every time I looked at them.

12:02.080 --> 12:06.660
Well, in the end, my wife 
gave up on trying to convince me.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.360
I sweated my days away 
to prove who was the strongest,

12:10.770 --> 12:13.540
and talked my nights away 
on swordsmanship.

12:14.050 --> 12:16.040
Those were the days.

12:16.370 --> 12:21.040
Then, don't you find 
your service in Kyoto a burden?

12:21.360 --> 12:25.100
No, I like it, too. 
Every day's a new experience.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.840
I can still devote myself to the sword,

12:28.280 --> 12:31.420
and getting to punish rascals 
makes life clear-cut.

12:31.880 --> 12:37.400
I want to make the townspeople happier, 
and to serve the Shogun and the Emperor.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.360
Right, Nio?

12:40.490 --> 12:41.090
Yes, sir.

12:42.120 --> 12:46.860
I think I understand 
why your men follow you.

12:52.180 --> 12:53.630
Why assassination?

12:54.630 --> 12:57.620
<i>A-Assassination? This old guy?</i>

12:57.810 --> 13:00.370
<i>No way. He looks so weak.</i>

13:00.650 --> 13:03.460
<i>N-Nio, did you know about this?</i>

13:05.040 --> 13:06.920
Vengeance for my son.

13:08.910 --> 13:14.620
It started with talk of an officer's post, 
but that was a bald-faced lie.

13:15.500 --> 13:19.440
They took our money for nothing, 
and my wife succumbed to disease.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.320
My son slit his own belly.

13:23.220 --> 13:27.440
Still, I've done terrible things.

13:29.150 --> 13:30.740
Come quietly.

13:38.190 --> 13:39.120
Don't.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.210
You'll only get hurt.

13:43.630 --> 13:47.350
I knew at first sight 
that I couldn't best you.

13:47.820 --> 13:48.330
Yes.

13:49.840 --> 13:54.320
But I haven't avenged my late son yet.

13:54.830 --> 13:55.680
I see.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.010
Kondo-san, he's running away!

14:00.730 --> 14:01.600
Huh?

14:01.800 --> 14:02.580
Wait!

14:02.580 --> 14:03.400
Out of my way!

14:06.640 --> 14:10.780
I wondered why it was so quiet 
and what was taking so long.

14:11.090 --> 14:11.960
Everyone!

14:12.910 --> 14:14.420
<b>Mizutaya Inn</b>

14:14.600 --> 14:16.220
I've got you now!

14:17.730 --> 14:19.410
Let go of me, damn you!

14:19.760 --> 14:21.900
You were lying?

14:21.900 --> 14:22.670
What?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.720
Then, what about your son?

14:24.930 --> 14:29.300
Another lie, of course! My idiot son's 
alive and well in the countryside!

14:29.720 --> 14:30.810
Is that so?

14:32.410 --> 14:33.660
I'm glad to hear it.

14:36.560 --> 14:40.380
Kondo-san, you're forthright to a fault.

14:40.850 --> 14:42.310
You trust too easily.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.320
Let's get going.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.370
Come on. Walk.

14:51.450 --> 14:53.830
Pardon the disturbance.

14:54.290 --> 14:55.160
Oh, no.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.430
Um...

14:57.250 --> 15:00.480
Thank you for keeping your word 
about not drawing your sword.

15:04.210 --> 15:06.380
<i>I knew Kondo-san was a great man.</i>

15:07.000 --> 15:10.810
<i>That's what drew everyone to him.</i>

15:11.340 --> 15:13.850
<b>Sake</b>

15:18.520 --> 15:22.030
Guess it's about time I went hunting.

15:23.910 --> 15:25.000
The sun's gone down.

15:25.850 --> 15:27.610
We won't allow any more victims.

15:28.050 --> 15:32.560
Three rogues who have attacked Aizu samurai
 remain. We'll deal with them tonight.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.910
But they're a crafty bunch.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.410
We don't know what they might do.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.750
True. Send word to 
Serizawa-san and his men.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.620
Taro.

15:43.320 --> 15:47.130
Tell him to keep his guard up and 
to take them alive if he can.

15:47.130 --> 15:48.630
Y-Yes, sir!

15:48.980 --> 15:52.010
We're counting on you, Taro-kun. 
You have an important job to do.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.170
Shove it!

15:54.120 --> 15:57.200
Why couldn't he have been at his usual bar?

15:57.200 --> 16:01.150
How am I supposed to find him now? 
Man, why does this only happen to me?

16:02.420 --> 16:04.300
Ah, I stepped in shit!

16:09.420 --> 16:10.780
Hang in there, Taro-kun.

16:11.050 --> 16:14.440
<i>Damn it. Nothing good's 
happened since he showed up.</i>

16:14.660 --> 16:17.540
Outta my way!

16:16.190 --> 16:17.540
I-I know that voice!

16:18.690 --> 16:20.500
S-Serizawa-sensei!

16:21.870 --> 16:22.840
Hm?

16:23.280 --> 16:25.300
<i>His eyes are totally unfocused?!</i>

16:25.440 --> 16:27.490
Where's that killer?

16:27.060 --> 16:30.380
<i>Shush! What'll you do if they </i>really<i> show up?</i>

16:27.840 --> 16:30.380
Serizawa Kamo's right here!

16:30.380 --> 16:31.290
You must be him.

16:32.740 --> 16:36.050
A big man over six shaku tall
 in a white coat.

16:36.250 --> 16:40.060
I hear you've been calling yourself 
the leader of the Miburo.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.690
<i>They found us!</i>

16:41.940 --> 16:46.200
Allow me to deliver your just deserts.

16:51.770 --> 16:55.950
I suppose I'll play the villain, then.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.830
Whoa, there.

16:58.090 --> 17:00.830
<i>I-It's hopeless. 
He can't even stand up straight.</i>

17:02.160 --> 17:04.210
<i>W-We're gonna be killed.</i>

17:06.940 --> 17:08.380
The shops will close soon.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.960
Tell anyone out walking to get inside.

17:11.220 --> 17:11.770
Yes, sir.

17:12.510 --> 17:17.050
Warn every woman and child. 
Walk elders to their homes.

17:17.320 --> 17:20.510
Hey! It's not safe out here after dark!

17:20.810 --> 17:22.380
Go on, hurry home.

17:22.550 --> 17:25.450
You've got some nerve, 
flirting where all the world can see.

17:25.450 --> 17:27.040
As if you aren't just jealous.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.170
Come now, hurry home before night falls.

17:29.660 --> 17:32.020
Go on. You're in danger out here, too.

17:32.240 --> 17:36.030
I'm begging you! 
Please don't walk outside at night!

17:36.030 --> 17:38.250
Kondo-san, I see more people over there.

17:38.250 --> 17:38.900
Let's go.

17:38.900 --> 17:39.400
Right.

17:50.830 --> 17:51.440
Hey.

17:54.760 --> 17:58.390
You're out looking for a chance 
to kill us, aren't you?

18:00.060 --> 18:02.640
Then you've come to your death 
and spared me the trouble.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.020
I'd figured you ran back home to the sticks.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.980
When a shinobi takes a job, 
he always sees it through.

18:16.250 --> 18:21.000
The dead guy. Jutaro or whatever 
his name was. He had this purse on him.

18:22.570 --> 18:24.680
The design matches yours.

18:24.910 --> 18:27.240
Not that I noticed myself.

18:27.750 --> 18:32.110
You know Nio, that white-haired kid?

18:32.830 --> 18:39.090
He wondered if this linked you and Jutaro,
and said he'd like to return it.

18:40.760 --> 18:45.770
He gave me a message for you:
 "I hope you'll agree to a deal now."

18:50.830 --> 18:53.690
I bet you have trouble 
keeping your footing up here.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.440
Unlike us Satsuma shinobi.

18:56.780 --> 19:00.840
I get why you're angry. Most people 
would assume we're taunting you.

19:02.670 --> 19:06.160
But I think he really 
means it as a kindness.

19:07.010 --> 19:10.440
Even though you're in league 
with a guy who tried to kill him.

19:12.710 --> 19:17.960
"Angry"? Hah! Shinobi don't act on emotion.

19:18.540 --> 19:22.700
How like a shinobi. 
I bet you take pride in that.

19:23.020 --> 19:25.980
I get it. I was the same way.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.850
The guy who raised me 
was basically the ideal samurai,

19:31.400 --> 19:33.750
and he told me a samurai should be strong.

19:35.510 --> 19:37.800
Strength is the mark of a samurai.

19:38.190 --> 19:41.860
Living like a samurai 
means pursuing strength.

19:43.790 --> 19:45.790
He wouldn't shut up about rules, either.

19:46.300 --> 19:49.280
"Don't let anyone you can't 
trust stand on your left."

19:49.810 --> 19:52.120
"You can't draw and 
strike them in one motion."

19:52.280 --> 19:53.630
What's your point?

19:54.060 --> 19:56.630
I'm saying, Nio's a troublemaker.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.000
He's hopeless with a sword.

20:01.310 --> 20:02.390
Just no good at all.

20:03.130 --> 20:05.760
He talks back. He's got 
a big head about sumo.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.800
He bosses people around, 
then ignores orders himself.

20:08.800 --> 20:14.310
"Help with the laundry." "Watch the fire." 
"Don't come in with dirty feet." "Mind this kid."

20:14.800 --> 20:16.370
Basically, he's a pain in the ass.

20:16.740 --> 20:19.900
Life has sucked ever since 
he joined the Miburo.

20:20.620 --> 20:24.270
But he's not tied down like you and I are.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.910
He's got no rules about 
how things ought to be.

20:28.650 --> 20:30.710
He's got no pride.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.200
Or maybe he does and 
I just can't make sense of it.

20:36.980 --> 20:42.550
All I know is that he tries to be there
for the weak and the hurt.

20:43.110 --> 20:47.510
In other words, he's a hopeless softy. So—

20:47.510 --> 20:48.520
That's enough!

20:50.010 --> 20:51.470
No more talk.

20:51.870 --> 20:56.480
Running your mouth won't help you beat me.
 You should've learned that yesterday.

20:56.980 --> 20:57.730
Yeah.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.490
Yesterday, you'd have been right.

21:00.490 --> 21:01.360
Huh?

21:02.020 --> 21:05.120
"A samurai ought to wear 
his sword on the left."

21:08.390 --> 21:11.000
You're left-handed, huh, Hajime-kun?

21:12.200 --> 21:14.260
Pride and rules can go to hell.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.680
You can't beat me anymore.

21:20.190 --> 21:22.750
<i>His left hand?</i>

21:24.430 --> 21:30.020
Come quietly, or I'll chop your arms 
and legs off before tossing you in a cell.

21:31.230 --> 21:32.340
Choose now.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.220
<i>Not good.</i>

21:36.300 --> 21:38.560
<i>This kid's bad news.</i>

21:45.030 --> 21:50.030
<b>Pride</b>

23:20.120 --> 23:25.550
<b>Next time</b>

23:22.220 --> 23:23.670
I am Kondo Isami.

23:24.190 --> 23:28.820
Three assassins remain. Or was it two?

23:28.820 --> 23:31.720
Actually, something tells me 
there were four of them.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.420
But enough details.

23:35.300 --> 23:36.890
I won't allow any more victims.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.160
We Miburo will catch them all before long.

23:41.140 --> 23:44.320
Nio, I believe in your efforts.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.690
Next time: "Palm of the Hand."

23:47.190 --> 23:48.500
It's not to be missed.

23:47.190 --> 23:50.030
<b>Palm of the Hand</b>
