11:25.930 --> 11:28.450
<b>He's set his sights on you, Isagi-kun.</b>

11:29.310 --> 11:31.350
<b>You sure do know a lot, Hiori.</b>

11:31.350 --> 11:36.550
<b>Yeah. We were both on

11:37.210 --> 11:40.390

11:40.390 --> 11:46.000

11:54.480 --> 11:55.820
<b><i>my spatial awareness,</i></b>

11:56.870 --> 11:58.240
<b><i>my off-the-ball movement,</i></b>

11:58.990 --> 12:00.420
<b><i>and my direct shot.</i></b>

12:29.360 --> 12:32.150
<b><i>In that case, I'll force open 
a new passing lane to Rin.</i></b>

<b><i>Measuring the distance to his opponent.
Stopping them from moving.</i></b>

12:51.270 --> 12:56.060

 control the distance to his opponent.</i></b>
