WEBVTT

01:35.660 --> 01:38.140
The purified blood of the demon monarch...

01:38.600 --> 01:40.350
I finally have all the ingredients.

01:43.940 --> 01:48.220
<i>The success rate and quantity 
depend on my intellect ability?</i>

01:48.960 --> 01:51.330
Are you all right, Sir Jinwoo?

01:54.720 --> 01:55.760
Craft it.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.990
<i>I've got the Elixir of Life.</i>

02:18.480 --> 02:23.440
<i>But will this really be enough 
to cure Mom's Eternal Sleep?</i>

02:28.070 --> 02:30.940
That's unusually considerate of you, Iron.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.790
Arise.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.350
A name, huh?

02:48.350 --> 02:52.790
Kaisellian? Karkalin? What was it again?

02:52.790 --> 02:56.680
You're not very good with names, 
are you, Sir Jinwoo?

02:56.680 --> 02:57.780
Eh, doesn't matter.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.850
Your name...

02:59.850 --> 03:00.910
is Kaisel.

03:06.460 --> 03:08.960
With his help, we'll be able 
to head back in no time!

03:08.960 --> 03:11.180
We should celebrate at the castle!

03:11.180 --> 03:13.060
I'm sure Father will be thrilled!

03:14.840 --> 03:18.340
Excuse me? Hey!

03:15.290 --> 03:18.340
<i>I want to head back as soon 
as possible to test the Elixir.</i>

03:18.340 --> 03:20.470
Are you listening?

03:19.870 --> 03:22.510
<i>Actually, wasn't this quest 
supposed to reward a rune stone?</i>

03:20.470 --> 03:24.390
We could have a party! A fun, lavish party!

03:23.620 --> 03:24.700
<i>Not those.</i>

03:25.620 --> 03:28.680
<i>Not that one, either... Let's see...</i>

03:29.720 --> 03:30.730
<i>There it is!</i>

03:37.020 --> 03:38.740
Shadow Exchange...

03:39.160 --> 03:43.830
So I can use this to swap places with a 
shadow soldier, no matter where they are?

03:44.150 --> 03:45.370
That simplifies things.

03:47.030 --> 03:49.700
Sorry, Esil, but you'll need 
to head back on your own.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.420
Huh? What about the party?!

03:51.420 --> 03:55.980
The Radisu manor is on the 80th floor. 
That's a bit out of the way for me.

03:55.980 --> 03:57.730
Really?!

03:58.500 --> 04:00.390
I'll see you again, if I get the chance.

04:00.840 --> 04:01.980
Look after yourself.

04:02.470 --> 04:04.480
Sir Jinwoo, I...

04:20.310 --> 04:23.230
I really did trade locations 
with the shadow I had on patrol.

04:24.250 --> 04:26.950
If it's got three hours of cooldown time,

04:26.950 --> 04:28.750
the best way to get home 
from here would be...

04:29.960 --> 04:31.250
Kaisel!

04:37.530 --> 04:41.360
The magic power of their hunters 
will act as bait for the ants,

04:41.360 --> 04:45.080
at which point we will use a special signal 
to disrupt their hive mind.

04:45.470 --> 04:49.660
In the meantime, a detachment 
of hunters will enter the colony

04:49.660 --> 04:52.310
while its soldiers are away 
and take down the queen, eh?

04:52.830 --> 04:56.400
The question is whether or not the signal 
will work the way it needs to.

04:58.410 --> 05:02.050
I can't deny I have some 
doubts about this plan,

05:02.050 --> 05:06.120
but our analysts have signed off on it. 
Everything seems to make sense.

05:06.490 --> 05:09.850
And in the event that the signal doesn't work,

05:09.850 --> 05:11.750
withdrawal was included 
as a contingency plan.

05:13.180 --> 05:19.870
All we can do now is make sure that our 
hunters are prepared when we send them in.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.120
Yes, sir.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.010
On that note...

05:23.630 --> 05:25.950
Were you able to reach Hunter Sung?

05:25.950 --> 05:27.480
Not yet.

05:29.980 --> 05:31.770
Yoonho!

05:31.770 --> 05:35.310
Getting drinks is supposed to be a chance 
to relax, y'know. Smile a little!

05:35.310 --> 05:38.160
I know that story I just told you was funny.

05:38.950 --> 05:41.780
Byung-gu. I just don't get it.

05:41.780 --> 05:44.360
If you keep frowning like that, 
you're gonna get wrinkles.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.850
Mind your own business!

05:48.450 --> 05:51.190
<i>This is Min Byung-gu, an S-Rank healer.</i>

05:51.190 --> 05:55.980
<i>He's unique in that he managed to retire at 
a young age without any significant injuries.</i>

05:55.980 --> 05:59.550
<i>We also used to be comrades.</i>

06:00.970 --> 06:05.630
<i>He hasn't changed. His sense of humor 
is just as weird as the rest of him.</i>

06:06.940 --> 06:08.220
I appreciate it.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.810
Yoonho.

06:11.390 --> 06:13.140
Are you serious about going?

06:14.100 --> 06:15.040
Yeah.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.110
Even after seeing what happened to Eunseok?

06:23.680 --> 06:25.310
That's why I'm going.

06:26.870 --> 06:29.310
If we don't do something about those ants,

06:29.310 --> 06:31.990
that kind of thing is going to 
happen all over the country.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.840
You never struck me as the patriotic type.

06:34.840 --> 06:39.650
Well, if I'm going either way, 
I figured it'd make a cool-sounding excuse.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.050
He did say something like that, didn't he?

06:48.670 --> 06:51.010
Well, I'm not going. No matter what.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.830
If you're here to convince me—

06:52.830 --> 06:54.680
I just wanted to let you know.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.080
Since this might be my last chance.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.800
Y'know, I'm taking the public service exam.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.570
You are?

07:05.080 --> 07:07.130
I just can't deal with that stuff anymore.

07:07.130 --> 07:09.020
Blood... and all that.

07:10.570 --> 07:12.560
So I'm gonna get a government job.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.460
Not too sure how good I'm gonna do 
in any subject but history, though.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.920
That's always been your specialty, hasn't it?

07:18.920 --> 07:21.910
Well, you know how I love period pieces, right?

07:21.910 --> 07:23.170
And that helps?

07:23.620 --> 07:26.230
Like... This is the way it oughta be, y'know?

07:26.660 --> 07:29.710
Leave the wars and such in the past.

07:30.460 --> 07:32.800
Agreed. You're exactly right.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.330
<i>We hunters are the ones
who are unusual.</i>

07:36.330 --> 07:37.850
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

07:37.850 --> 07:42.320
<i>I don't know if I've ever met another 
that dislikes fighting magic beasts.</i>

07:42.770 --> 07:47.030
<i>Combat becomes part of their routine. 
Some of them even enjoy it.</i>

07:47.910 --> 07:50.890
<i>Maybe that trait is one of the 
requirements for awakening?</i>

07:50.890 --> 07:55.000
Yoonho. Your forehead! 
You're gonna make yourself look old.

07:55.290 --> 07:57.030
Shut up and drink!

07:57.520 --> 07:59.790
You do indulge your vices, don't you?

08:02.770 --> 08:04.360
What's that supposed to mean?

08:28.730 --> 08:30.830
<i>She got those burns because of me.</i>

08:42.970 --> 08:45.090
<i>She might not be able to swallow it.</i>

08:45.770 --> 08:49.310
<i>And even if she does, there's no 
guarantee what might happen.</i>

08:50.440 --> 08:51.390
<i>But...</i>

08:52.430 --> 08:55.760
<i>I've seen the kind of miracles 
that the system is capable of.</i>

08:56.540 --> 08:59.040
<i>It brought me from E-Rank all the way to here.</i>

09:03.010 --> 09:04.690
<i>I'll have to have faith.</i>

10:03.220 --> 10:04.410
Mom...

10:09.460 --> 10:12.340
<i>Please... You've gotta wake up!</i>

10:13.090 --> 10:16.500
<i>All of my fighting to get stronger... 
It was all for this.</i>

10:19.970 --> 10:23.450
<i>Please wake up, Mom.</i>

10:28.000 --> 10:31.360
I just can't focus today. 
What's going on with me?

10:41.810 --> 10:43.780
That's a warm breeze.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.470
Is that you, Jinwoo?

11:21.080 --> 11:23.870
How long was I asleep?

11:26.220 --> 11:28.710
Four years. It's been four years...

11:29.340 --> 11:30.630
And Jinah?

11:32.340 --> 11:33.780
She's doing well.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.390
Thank you, Jinwoo.

11:40.430 --> 11:43.180
You kept your promise, didn't you?

11:45.840 --> 11:48.210
You look so grown-up now.

11:48.650 --> 11:54.910
But you're hurt. 
You must've been pushing yourself.

11:59.490 --> 12:02.010
You've been through a lot, haven't you?

12:09.810 --> 12:12.670
It's... It's...

12:15.340 --> 12:16.800
okay...

12:28.430 --> 12:31.730
Thank you, Jinwoo.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.310
Yeah.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.990
An Eternal Sleep patient woke up?!

12:43.990 --> 12:46.370
As hard as it is to believe, yes.

12:46.780 --> 12:50.540
And all of her vital functions 
are operating normally,

12:50.540 --> 12:54.650
so she and her family are both 
asking for her immediate release.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.040
You're such a fine young lady now, Jinah—

13:02.860 --> 13:04.780
Mom!

13:08.890 --> 13:11.710
I'm sorry I worried you.

13:12.660 --> 13:15.180
<i>It was all worth it.</i>

13:15.690 --> 13:19.500
<i>This is the reward I really 
wanted the entire time.</i>

13:23.370 --> 13:27.480
Thank you all for assembling.

13:27.480 --> 13:32.540
As you're aware, the flying ant 
magic beasts from Jeju Island

13:32.540 --> 13:36.710
are starting to cause damage 
in the surrounding areas.

13:37.030 --> 13:44.210
In response, the Hunter's Association has 
announced the fourth raid on Jeju Island.

13:44.970 --> 13:49.220
<i>This time, the operation will not 
only include our own S-Ranks</i>

13:49.540 --> 13:54.580
<i>but ten of Japan's, as well.</i>

13:55.190 --> 14:00.860
<i>Additionally, hunters of A-Rank and below 
will be protecting the waters and the mainland</i>

14:00.860 --> 14:06.320
<i>to ensure the safety of the public.</i>

14:07.420 --> 14:11.250
This time, we are prepared to see this through!

14:16.550 --> 14:18.040
Eunseok...

14:18.340 --> 14:20.710
I'm honestly terrified.

14:21.210 --> 14:22.970
I feel the same way.

14:24.360 --> 14:29.600
But the people who can't fight at all 
must be hundreds of times more scared.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.120
We need to end this. That's something 
that only we, with our powers, can do.

14:34.590 --> 14:38.210
We can't let them turn our country 
into one big anthill, can we?

14:38.210 --> 14:39.820
Dumbass!

14:40.640 --> 14:43.260
I'm gonna stomp out their little nest...

14:45.170 --> 14:47.520
You know how Yoonho can be unpredictable.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.160
Both his personality and his powers.

14:49.990 --> 14:55.290
When he needs help, you and I are 
the only ones who'll be able to do it.

15:06.890 --> 15:10.840
Unbelievable. I leave you 
alone for <i>one</i> week...

15:10.840 --> 15:14.510
I guess I can start making up 
for all the housework I missed.

15:14.510 --> 15:16.470
We'll take care of it together.

15:18.270 --> 15:20.980
The apartment's certainly 
starting to show its age.

15:20.980 --> 15:23.140
It's hard to get some of these stains out.

15:23.140 --> 15:27.020
I mean, we've lived here 
since I was born, so...

15:27.020 --> 15:28.200
I guess that's true.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.410
<i>I've wanted this for so long...</i>

15:32.310 --> 15:34.660
<i>but I'm still feeling anxious.</i>

15:36.970 --> 15:39.670
<i>In my time as a hunter,</i>

15:39.980 --> 15:43.740
<i>I've ended up crossing a line that I don't 
think there's any coming back from.</i>

15:45.660 --> 15:46.520
Jinwoo.

15:47.420 --> 15:48.380
What's up?

15:50.620 --> 15:53.710
Have you heard from your father at all?

15:58.190 --> 16:00.480
Come to think of it, I saw the news.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.400
You became a hunter.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.140
Yeah.

16:03.450 --> 16:07.410
Remember how your father was a firefighter 
before becoming a hunter?

16:07.410 --> 16:11.740
I married him because the way he wanted 
to help other people was just so impressive.

16:11.740 --> 16:14.910
It looks like you've inherited that part of him.

16:16.450 --> 16:20.270
I wanna help people, too! 
That's why I'm gonna become a doctor!

16:20.270 --> 16:23.300
That's true. You're also your 
father's daughter, Jinah.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.380
Yeah! I know, right?

16:25.920 --> 16:27.030
Hello?

16:29.500 --> 16:31.830
Good work with the press conference, sir.

16:31.830 --> 16:35.030
Right. I appreciate your joining us.

16:35.030 --> 16:36.030
Of course.

16:36.840 --> 16:40.150
I didn't expect to see him right afterward...

16:40.870 --> 16:42.720
Thomas Andre.

16:42.720 --> 16:46.000
An S-Rank hunter under America's jurisdiction 
with enough power to rival a country.

16:46.670 --> 16:49.950
I had hoped he intended on joining the mission.

16:49.950 --> 16:52.740
I can't blame you, considering the timing.

16:53.040 --> 16:58.020
But someone with enough strength to go 
toe-to-toe with national militaries

16:58.020 --> 17:01.270
can't casually intervene in foreign affairs.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.280
True.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.980
But then why come at all?

17:05.980 --> 17:10.940
Maybe he meant what he said about 
popping in while he was in the neighborhood,

17:10.940 --> 17:14.600
maybe he came to warn us about Hunter Hwang...

17:14.910 --> 17:18.890
or perhaps something else entirely.

17:19.790 --> 17:22.730
Have you been able to contact Hunter Sung yet?

17:22.730 --> 17:24.480
Just a moment ago, actually.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.510
He should be arriving shortly.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.570
The operation launches in four days.

17:30.990 --> 17:33.920
This raid has been long-unfinished 
business of ours.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.120
Would you be willing 
to lend us your strength?

17:37.790 --> 17:40.380
<i>This </i>is<i> a perfect opportunity to level up.</i>

17:40.380 --> 17:41.990
<i>I'd hate to let it go.</i>

17:42.730 --> 17:44.830
<i>Or I would've hated to... until recently.</i>

17:49.800 --> 17:50.830
I...

17:52.830 --> 17:54.320
<i>Magic wavelengths?</i>

17:55.760 --> 17:59.260
I'm impressed you could sense that 
at such a distance.

17:59.760 --> 18:04.330
Our S-Rank hunters are getting 
some exercise in the gymnasium.

18:04.850 --> 18:08.480
If you're curious, we can go take a look.

18:22.120 --> 18:28.090
Master Baek... You really ought to train your 
lower body more while you're still young.

18:28.090 --> 18:32.470
My job mostly keeps me in the office, Master Ma!

18:33.230 --> 18:37.810
For so many S-Rank hunters to gather 
in the same place is rare indeed.

18:38.190 --> 18:42.930
The two of them were probably the source 
of the magic wavelength from before.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.670
Hunter Baek is being pushed pretty hard.

18:45.670 --> 18:50.480
That said, I doubt Hunter Ma would stand 
much chance if President Baek got serious.

18:51.160 --> 18:51.970
Hello.

18:52.540 --> 18:57.160
The fellow in the gi is Ma Dongwook 
of the Fame Guild.

18:57.790 --> 19:00.120
Why hold back against him, then?

19:00.120 --> 19:03.530
He doesn't seem like the kind of opponent 
you'd want to do that with.

19:03.530 --> 19:07.000
He can't really cut loose around other people.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.710
He turns into a monster 
when fighting with all his power.

19:11.990 --> 19:14.810
<i>Then the rumors about him 
transforming in battle are true?</i>

19:14.810 --> 19:18.980
And over there, from the 
Knights Guild, we have...

19:21.140 --> 19:24.080
Oh, and here are our guests.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.980
The S-Rank hunters from Japan.

19:27.980 --> 19:31.560
Including their guild master, Goto Ryuji.

19:32.980 --> 19:34.280
Who's that?

19:35.530 --> 19:39.520
That's Hunter Sung Jinwoo. 
He was just named S-Rank.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.830
He's supposed to be a strong assassin type.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.500
No, I'd heard he was a mage type.

19:46.710 --> 19:47.820
Him?

19:50.560 --> 19:55.600
Hey, if it isn't Sung, the guy who 
made a mess of Minsung's big stunt.

19:56.540 --> 19:58.940
<i>That explains the change in atmosphere.</i>

20:06.520 --> 20:09.900
If this is the best this country has, 
I'm a bit disappointed.

20:10.350 --> 20:13.580
After watching you fight so often,

20:13.580 --> 20:15.870
other S-Ranks hardly even 
look like S-Ranks at all.

20:15.870 --> 20:17.640
I don't know if I agree.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.740
I don't like the sound of that.

20:19.740 --> 20:23.430
Miss Interpreter, you were 
makin' fun of us, right?

20:23.430 --> 20:25.540
I could tell from yer tone, if not yer words.

20:25.540 --> 20:27.080
That's amazing, Master!

20:27.540 --> 20:28.520
And you are...?

20:28.520 --> 20:33.340
You're lookin' at the guild master of the 
Knights Guild, Mr. Park Jongsoo himself!

20:33.340 --> 20:36.420
Park Jongsoo? I'm not familiar 
with a hunter by that name.

20:36.750 --> 20:42.080
Y-You might not've heard of him before 'cuz 
he's an A-Rank instead of an S-Rank, but...

20:42.080 --> 20:45.180
We're still one of the five 
biggest guilds in the country!

20:45.180 --> 20:47.390
We'll be actin' as security on this—

20:45.510 --> 20:47.390
What are you doing?

20:47.620 --> 20:50.840
I'd advise against making a scene.

20:50.840 --> 20:54.270
Yer got it all wrong! These folks 
said we were a buncha weaklings!

20:54.270 --> 20:56.410
Doesn't matter. Chill out.

20:56.410 --> 20:57.690
Actually, this is perfect.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.010
Let's take this rare opportunity...

20:59.010 --> 21:02.330
...to engage in some friendly sparring 
between S-Rank hunters.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.160
So I hafta sit out?!

21:05.160 --> 21:08.430
Feel free to set the rules yourselves.

21:08.970 --> 21:10.430
Sounds good to me.

21:11.180 --> 21:14.910
I say we exclude any mage types 
or noncombatants,

21:14.910 --> 21:17.630
since it's difficult for them 
to compete individually.

21:17.630 --> 21:18.840
That's fine.

21:18.840 --> 21:22.390
Combat hunters only, then.

21:22.390 --> 21:25.400
You lose if your wrist is grabbed, 
you're tagged on the back,

21:25.400 --> 21:28.120
or any part of your body touches 
the floor besides your feet.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.690
As for the format...

21:29.690 --> 21:33.310
Instead of one-on-one, 
why not make it a free-for-all?

21:34.110 --> 21:38.310
The raid is bound to be just as chaotic.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.650
Understood. Let's go with that.

21:46.160 --> 21:52.290
Our representatives will be 
Hunters Cha, Lim, Ma, and Baek.

21:52.290 --> 21:57.250
Then we'll be sending Hunters Tawata, 
Kumamoto, Hoshino, and Tanaka.

21:59.110 --> 22:03.040
Now then, let us commence the bout.
