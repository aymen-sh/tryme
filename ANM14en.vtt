00:00.900 --> 00:04.400
We need 250 ryo for matching coats?

00:04.860 --> 00:06.000
How much is that each?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.310
I have no idea.

00:07.860 --> 00:11.240
There's only one thing to do: 
go into town and make money.

00:12.950 --> 00:15.290
So which one of us do you think...

00:16.130 --> 00:17.870
will earn the most?

00:18.060 --> 00:19.320
Hey! Wait up!

00:21.450 --> 00:23.790
It'll be me, of course.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.170

00:28.950 --> 00:30.640
All right. Let's get going.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.800
H-Hang on, Hijikata.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.520
What if we run into the Risshidan?

00:38.380 --> 00:39.060

00:39.060 --> 00:40.020

Aw, come on! We'll work our butts off.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.680

She's got some real old-fashioned ideas.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.190
Wh-What are we gonna do, Nio?

03:19.190 --> 03:21.960
Serizawa-sensei will kill me 
if I go back empty-handed.

03:22.230 --> 03:24.320
That's why we need to look for work.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.640
We're doomed! Doomed!

03:28.750 --> 03:29.970
Don't worry.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.690
Together, the three of us 
will figure something out.

something to say, say it.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.050
Oh, right.

03:56.340 --> 03:59.900
What do you think about 
"bringing back the age of the samurai"?

04:00.170 --> 04:02.640
Huh? You mean the Risshidan?

04:04.480 --> 04:08.300
Are they seriously trying to roll 
things back to the Warring States?

04:08.750 --> 04:10.400
In their dreams.

04:11.310 --> 04:12.770
It's just not realistic.

04:13.040 --> 04:13.570
Yeah.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.720
And one other thing.

04:16.360 --> 04:20.280
They asked me what the "way of the sword" is.
 What do <i>you</i> think, Hajime-kun?

04:23.160 --> 04:26.360
How can I become a samurai like you?

04:28.800 --> 04:30.100
Be strong.

04:35.380 --> 04:37.350
Isn't that obvious? Strength.

04:38.020 --> 04:38.760
<i>Strength?</i>

04:39.620 --> 04:42.410
I-I see. That's a very "you" answer.

04:42.410 --> 04:45.510
Hey! I found a kashiwa mochi on the ground!

04:46.010 --> 04:47.990
Huh? Where're you going, Hajime?

04:48.680 --> 04:50.270
Don't follow me, either of you.

04:51.770 --> 04:55.360
Oh, I get it! You want mochi, too, right?

04:55.730 --> 04:58.890
Oh, fine. I'll split mine in half.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.100
Nio, I'm glad I got to meet you.

05:01.460 --> 05:01.900
What?

05:03.280 --> 05:04.220
Hajime-kun?

05:06.140 --> 05:07.120
Don't follow me.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.600
What's your problem? Don't you want any?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.560
Serizawa-sensei.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.880
Let's "borrow" some cash from 
one of these places and go drinking.

05:21.140 --> 05:24.390
Good idea. Making money's a breeze.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.630
You dolts.

05:26.870 --> 05:30.260
How do samurai earn their keep?

05:30.590 --> 05:31.640
By the sword.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.900
We'll just challenge dojos 
and make them pay up.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.540
Shinpachi, how much have you got?

05:49.480 --> 05:51.110
Let me see...

05:52.210 --> 05:54.320
Enough to buy us both some hot soba.

05:55.920 --> 05:56.810
What now?

05:58.370 --> 05:59.320
That's what.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.720
I'll buy it back when I strike it rich.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.150
What will you do?
A samurai's sword is his life.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.850
Samurai don't sweat the small stuff.

06:21.230 --> 06:25.880
We'll knock their socks off 
when we make all 250 ryo in one night!

06:27.320 --> 06:29.500
You're no samurai.

06:32.080 --> 06:32.660
Huh?

06:37.600 --> 06:38.670
What did you say?

06:52.190 --> 06:54.220
I beg your pardon. I misspoke.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.530
Forgive me.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.720
I don't mind.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.780
You're never too proud to say sorry.

07:04.780 --> 07:08.910
I like that about you, Shinpachi.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.600
No, I'm truly sorry.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.630
So what's your plan?

07:14.810 --> 07:16.890
What did you stake your sword on?

07:17.420 --> 07:20.880
Isn't it obvious? I've got funds. 
Now I'll go multiply 'em.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.280

07:24.290 --> 07:25.540

Come on.

Which is it?

07:38.240 --> 07:39.590
One and two! Odd!

07:40.400 --> 07:41.440
It was odd?

07:41.440 --> 07:42.900
We blew it!

07:43.200 --> 07:44.220
<i>A couple of suckers.</i>

07:44.750 --> 07:45.380
<i>Easy marks.</i>

07:45.870 --> 07:47.400

07:48.470 --> 07:50.100
Just you watch.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.820
Sanosuke, we ought to stop now.

07:53.000 --> 07:53.870
What?

07:54.550 --> 07:59.590
Forget buying back your sword. 
We'll lose everything if this continues.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.800
It's a shame, but needs must.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.080
Damn. So this is how it ends.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.210

08:06.920 --> 08:11.360
You shouldn't back down

08:38.430 --> 08:39.570
It's fine.

08:39.800 --> 08:43.740
We need to get everyone coats, 
and beggars can't be choosers.

08:44.150 --> 08:45.120
But still...

08:45.400 --> 08:47.300
That's precious to you, isn't it?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.550
You brought it all the way from Edo.

08:49.550 --> 08:51.040
Do you really want to sell it?

08:52.670 --> 08:53.460

Trade me for it, then.

11:32.350 --> 11:33.190
How about that one?

11:35.150 --> 11:35.670
What?

11:35.890 --> 11:38.090
That's a Yukihira from Bungo!

11:38.090 --> 11:40.800
I wouldn't sell that for any money!

11:45.110 --> 11:48.010
B-By the by, what is your budget?

11:48.440 --> 11:49.270
Money?

11:49.870 --> 11:53.190
Sorry, I don't have much on me.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.280
If you're just looking, go somewhere else!

12:00.100 --> 12:01.360
What was that about?

12:02.220 --> 12:06.450
I won't get anywhere here. They charge 
for signature and reputation, not quality.

12:06.780 --> 12:07.650
Hey, you there.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.920
<i>Who's this? He looks shabby.</i>

12:18.760 --> 12:19.750
Keep your distance.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.760
Show me your face.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.390
A woman?

12:30.390 --> 12:34.020
You're a Miburo, right? 
Hijikata-san the Miburo.

12:34.330 --> 12:36.180
That's right. How did you know?

12:36.540 --> 12:38.030
I've got a good sword.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.280
And I want you to use it.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.780
R-Really?

12:43.330 --> 12:45.230
You have a sword you want me to use?

12:45.230 --> 12:47.840
That's right, Hijikata-san the Miburo.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.020
You.

12:49.020 --> 12:50.500
Wait. Give me space.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.880
First, tell me how you know about me.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.710
How? You're famous.

12:56.710 --> 12:59.360
Hijikata the Miburo: grouchy as a demon,

12:59.360 --> 13:02.040
with old indigo clothes and 
a handsome face that's wasted on him.

13:02.370 --> 13:05.120
You scowl all the time, 
which drives people off.

13:05.120 --> 13:09.370
You walk like a ruffian, you mutter 
to yourself, and children don't like you.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.800
All right. You can stop now.

13:12.310 --> 13:14.670
So what's this about a sword?

13:14.670 --> 13:15.810
Right, the sword.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.040
It's my teacher's.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.820
The master is the best swordsmith in Japan.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.550
Oh? Is he now?

13:26.310 --> 13:27.600
It's a dump!

13:28.720 --> 13:33.120
Do you even get <i>any</i> traffic 
this far back from the street?

13:33.120 --> 13:36.530
We used to get people coming here nonstop.

13:36.530 --> 13:38.610
Hah. That's hard to believe.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.830
It's my fault.

13:43.420 --> 13:44.280
Well, whatever.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.690
The best swordsmith in Japan lives here?

13:47.690 --> 13:49.080
The best in the <i>world!</i>

13:49.080 --> 13:51.470
You just called him "the best in Japan"!

13:51.470 --> 13:53.230
Keep it down, Sakura!

13:53.460 --> 13:57.620
You'll spoil my concentration, dimwit! 
Get inside! You're bothering the neighbors!

13:59.880 --> 14:01.990
Sorry, Master.

14:02.530 --> 14:04.350
I brought a loudmouthed customer.

14:04.350 --> 14:04.970
Hey.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.220
Close the door behind you.

14:20.220 --> 14:20.790
What?

14:21.140 --> 14:22.580
I'm talking to <i>you</i>, Sakura.

14:22.580 --> 14:23.680
You useless lump.

14:24.070 --> 14:25.170
Y-Yes, sir!

14:32.480 --> 14:34.320
Look at all these swords.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.860
Those are leftovers that didn't sell.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.720
Didn't sell?

14:39.220 --> 14:41.600
Aren't you the best swordsmith in Japan?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.740
I... I made those swords.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.280
What?

14:46.860 --> 14:50.740
I... I'm an apprentice.

14:53.540 --> 14:59.130
A woman using the forge 
has ruined my reputation.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.750
She's a nuisance.

15:03.660 --> 15:05.720
Go home to your parents already.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.250
I won't leave!

15:07.790 --> 15:13.830
Her family's known for flower arranging.
Good enough for the Honganji Temple every year.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.970
This again?

15:15.460 --> 15:17.470
Really? That's quite something.

15:17.720 --> 15:22.540
She got kicked out for being dense, 
and before I knew it, she settled in here.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.480
I left on my own.

15:24.760 --> 15:28.790
An odd duck who left a
 good family to make swords,

15:28.790 --> 15:32.010
and a stubborn smith who
 gripes while he teaches her.

15:32.450 --> 15:34.950
I can't think of a stranger pair.

15:36.780 --> 15:39.240
I haven't taught her much of anything.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.640
She's free to watch me work 
and steal any know-how she can.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.750
Then she takes over the forge 
when I'm not using it.

15:47.060 --> 15:52.070
But I know my stuff. After all, I watch the
 master every hour, day and night.

15:52.070 --> 15:56.400
Idiot. What kind of craftsman 
declares <i>themself</i> qualified?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.520
This is why I say you're still green.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.990
S-Sorry.

16:01.510 --> 16:02.760
You see?

16:02.910 --> 16:05.290
No wonder we get no buyers.

16:06.440 --> 16:11.770
In what world would any samurai 
trust his life to a sword made by a woman?

16:12.400 --> 16:15.040
You can't blame a single one of them.

16:17.990 --> 16:20.420
I see. So that's how it is.

16:22.360 --> 16:27.470
Word of a female swordsmith 
drove people away from this smithy.

16:28.460 --> 16:33.520
But if I make a name for myself with one of 
these swords, the customers will come back.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.460
Is that the idea?

16:42.400 --> 16:44.540
A hitatsura pattern with yubashiri markings.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.040
I-I'm still in training, so...

16:55.250 --> 16:57.000
It sits well in the hand.

16:59.220 --> 16:59.940
I'll take it.

17:00.460 --> 17:01.090
Huh?

17:01.780 --> 17:06.650
N-No, Hijikata-san, I want you 
to carry one of the master'sâ€”

17:06.920 --> 17:09.640
I judge by quality, not reputation.

17:10.380 --> 17:11.290
I'll take this one.

17:13.020 --> 17:14.630
No, listen, youâ€”

17:14.630 --> 17:15.290
Sakura.

17:17.100 --> 17:17.880
A sheath.

17:19.000 --> 17:19.800
Make it quick.

17:20.110 --> 17:21.290
R-Right.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.070
Good.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.840
You're becoming a <i>smith?</i>

17:57.330 --> 18:00.920
Get out! Never darken our door again!

18:03.880 --> 18:06.600
Don't mock me, woman! Go home!

18:07.200 --> 18:08.280
I'm not leaving!

18:09.100 --> 18:12.410
I've got nowhere else to go!

18:09.570 --> 18:10.150
<b>Swordsmith</b>

18:10.150 --> 18:10.780
<b>Swordsmith</b>

18:10.780 --> 18:12.400
<b>Swordsmith</b>

18:12.400 --> 18:12.900
<b>Swordsmith</b>

18:12.900 --> 18:13.660
<b>Swordsmith</b>

18:13.660 --> 18:13.820
<b>Swordsmith</b>

18:14.520 --> 18:18.580
Sorry, but I'm not doing business 
with a forge worked by a woman.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.590
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.550
Don't you worry about it.

18:29.550 --> 18:33.230
Sooner or later, they'll realize 
craft is all about results.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.370
Everyone will.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.100
What are <i>you</i> crying for?!

19:30.630 --> 19:35.600
What'd I tell you? Keep at it, 
and they'll come around eventually.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.120
Master.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.870
Hijikata-san, was it? 
I don't need your money.

19:44.230 --> 19:47.360
Instead, I've got a request.

19:48.660 --> 19:52.390
From now on, take your 
business to her, not me.

19:52.660 --> 19:55.070
She knows her craft, if nothing else.

19:56.650 --> 19:58.660
You bow, too!

19:58.660 --> 19:59.820
R-Right!

20:01.880 --> 20:02.980
All right.

20:06.460 --> 20:07.400
I'll be back.

20:07.850 --> 20:09.400
Y-You mean it?

20:09.960 --> 20:13.890
You'll get a bad name, too, 
if you carry swords made by a woman.

20:14.470 --> 20:15.900
A bad name?

20:17.570 --> 20:20.200
I'm used to it.

20:21.660 --> 20:24.400
That place really does make good dango.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.360
This again? Now I've <i>got</i> to try it.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.080
Mountain.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.080
River.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.890
What's today's catch?

20:46.370 --> 20:47.090
Sweetfish.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.320
The Snake's on the second floor.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.120
I know.

21:08.760 --> 21:12.280
Well, well. Long time no see.

21:12.970 --> 21:15.530
I didn't think you'd ever be back.

21:15.960 --> 21:20.050
You got bigger again. A snake in name only.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.030
I can't even wipe my own ass anymore.

21:26.620 --> 21:31.300
So? Since you came to me, 
I'm guessing you want money?

21:33.570 --> 21:37.020
Who will you kill, Jiro?

21:38.970 --> 21:44.440
Or is it Saito Hajime II now?

21:45.030 --> 21:50.040
<b>The
Race</b>

21:45.030 --> 21:50.040
<b>to
Raise
Money</b>

23:20.160 --> 23:25.550
<b>Next time</b>

23:21.470 --> 23:26.580
Each in his own way, 
the Miburo race to raise funds.

23:27.330 --> 23:33.810
While Hajime acts alone, 
Nio and Taro come across a woman.

23:34.430 --> 23:38.480
With the exception of
 meeting Shogun Iemochi,

23:38.480 --> 23:43.940
this encounter changes Nio's destiny 
and the Miburo's more than any other.

23:44.180 --> 23:47.190
Next time: "Like a River's Flow."

23:47.200 --> 23:50.030
<b>Like</b>

23:47.200 --> 23:50.030
<b>a
River's
Flow</b>

23:47.880 --> 23:49.150
It won't disappoint.
