00:00.680 --> 00:05.440
<b>After receiving Japan's request, America's 
number one hero, Star and Stripe,</b>

00:05.440 --> 00:07.070
<b>made an urgent visit to Japan.</b>

00:07.450 --> 00:11.160
<b>Tomura Shigaraki launched a violent 
attack on her when she arrived.</b>

00:12.030 --> 00:16.580
<b>Star used her Quirk, New Order, which 
could change the rules of the world,</b>

00:16.580 --> 00:19.930
<b>and even though she was 
able to corner Shigaraki,</b>

00:19.930 --> 00:21.630
<b>she ended up being narrowly defeated.</b>

00:22.710 --> 00:27.670
<b>But we found out that Star used 
the last embers of her life</b>

00:27.670 --> 00:31.100
<b>to deal serious damage 
to Shigaraki's Quirks.</b>

00:32.370 --> 00:35.900
<b>Shigaraki won't be able to 
move for at least a week.</b>

00:35.900 --> 00:40.020
<b>It's Star and Stripe's final 
gift to us--an extension.</b>

00:40.580 --> 00:44.860
<b>In order for you to protect yourselves 
and those you want to protect,</b>

00:45.210 --> 00:49.270
<b>you need to use this extension 
to get as strong as you can.</b>

02:31.750 --> 02:34.990
<b>It's all right, Other Me.</b>

02:35.370 --> 02:41.020
<b>It's all right. The factors are 
just mixed up and out of order.</b>

02:41.610 --> 02:45.270
<b>With time, you'll be able 
to use your Quirks again.</b>

02:46.290 --> 02:47.990
<b>I'll kill you...</b>

02:47.990 --> 02:49.550
<b>I'll kill you...</b>

02:50.030 --> 02:51.230
<b>I hate you.</b>

02:51.870 --> 02:56.050
<b>As long as someone remembers 
the face of All Might,</b>

02:56.050 --> 02:58.520
<b>this frustration won't go away!</b>

02:58.820 --> 03:01.690
<b>Our consciousnesses are combining...</b>

03:02.210 --> 03:03.980
<b>I can feel it...</b>

03:04.390 --> 03:06.630
<b>His intense anger.</b>

03:06.630 --> 03:10.560
<b>I'm sharing in Tomura's resentment.</b>

03:11.320 --> 03:14.670
<b>It's all right. This is excellent.</b>

03:15.280 --> 03:17.640
<b>Even though we didn't get New Order,</b>

03:17.640 --> 03:21.670
<b>you could say that we cleared 
away our greatest obstacle.</b>

03:22.030 --> 03:23.780
<b>Take it easy!</b>

03:23.780 --> 03:27.700
<b>It's not good to cling to a 
single blueprint, anyway.</b>

03:28.940 --> 03:32.470
<b>Sorry to say this after 
having you get ready,</b>

03:32.470 --> 03:34.350
<b>but please wait a little longer.</b>

03:34.630 --> 03:36.470
<b>No way. I can't take it anymore.</b>

03:36.470 --> 03:38.870
<b>My old man's flying energetically 
in the sky today, too.</b>

03:38.870 --> 03:40.360
<b>I can't stand it.</b>

03:40.640 --> 03:46.050
<b>Toya, you and I are similar, but 
there's one difference between us--</b>

03:46.050 --> 03:46.660
<b>Huh?</b>

03:47.300 --> 03:48.540
<b>Listen close.</b>

03:49.160 --> 03:57.510
<b>Someone like me makes many, many 
routes for a single goal.</b>

03:58.040 --> 04:06.120
<b>More precisely, I make just-in-case routes 
many years, even decades in advance,</b>

04:06.120 --> 04:11.440
<b>and sift through the best paths 
in order to reach my goal.</b>

04:11.800 --> 04:12.920
<b>That's right.</b>

04:13.390 --> 04:15.300
<b>There is an infinite number of routes.</b>

04:16.560 --> 04:19.940
<b>My completed body will take more time,</b>

04:19.940 --> 04:24.280
<b>and Ikuzu Midoriya has returned to U.A.,</b>

04:24.910 --> 04:28.180
<b>but unlike you, Toya...</b>

04:28.180 --> 04:30.340
<b>I have many friends.</b>

04:31.500 --> 04:35.500
<b>Villain</b>

04:38.100 --> 04:39.510
<b>Birds!</b>

04:40.340 --> 04:41.830
<b>Here I go!</b>

04:41.830 --> 04:43.060
<b>Black Abyss!</b>

04:44.400 --> 04:46.310
<b>Come on!</b>

04:48.090 --> 04:50.020
<b>Octoblow!</b>

04:50.020 --> 04:52.840
<b>Twirling Tail Dance!</b>

04:55.190 --> 04:56.270
<b>Chargebolt!</b>

04:56.270 --> 04:57.900
<b>Here I go!</b>

05:00.580 --> 05:02.770
<b>Take that and that and that and that!</b>

05:04.790 --> 05:06.310
<b>One more time!</b>

05:06.820 --> 05:07.770
<b>Froppy!</b>

05:08.060 --> 05:09.110
<b>Uravity!</b>

05:09.470 --> 05:10.460
<b>Meteor...</b>

05:10.460 --> 05:11.610
<b>...Fafrotskies!</b>

05:14.260 --> 05:15.450
<b>Blackwhip!</b>

05:17.880 --> 05:18.930
<b>Come on!</b>

05:22.220 --> 05:23.370
<b>Got him!</b>

05:26.510 --> 05:28.030
<b>Take that!</b>

05:33.100 --> 05:37.010
<b>It's the "store it up and fire" 
I learned at Endeavor's.</b>

05:37.010 --> 05:39.140
<b>And it's not just one blast.</b>

05:39.140 --> 05:42.270
<b>I make them into balls of sweat 
and blow them up all at once.</b>

05:42.270 --> 05:44.600
<b>That's my new Cluster.</b>

05:44.930 --> 05:48.870
<b>Starting now, I'm going to 
level up all my moves.</b>

05:48.870 --> 05:51.210
<b>It takes time to heat up my body, though.</b>

05:51.210 --> 05:53.830
<b>Oh, so that's why you're 
wearing your winter outfit.</b>

05:53.830 --> 05:57.070
<b>It's so hot it eats up my stamina, though, 
so I have to choose one or the other.</b>

05:57.560 --> 06:02.130
<b>Todoroki also seems like he's 
different from before, too.</b>

06:02.750 --> 06:04.990
<b>I'm just starting to get the hang of it,</b>

06:05.390 --> 06:08.750
<b>but I think my control of my left side is 
getting close to that of my right side.</b>

06:09.410 --> 06:11.960
<b>So I can make a body that 
can withstand Dabi's fire.</b>

06:15.840 --> 06:18.810
<b>Right and left, my body is one.</b>

06:22.810 --> 06:25.780
<b>All Might said it'd be an 
all-out war, but you know...</b>

06:25.780 --> 06:26.810
<b>Hm?</b>

06:26.810 --> 06:30.160
<b>Aren't the villains' two 
bosses weakened right now?</b>

06:30.560 --> 06:34.090
<b>We've captured Gigantomachia and 
kept him asleep, too, right?</b>

06:34.480 --> 06:37.850
<b>So once we find their two bosses, 
don't you think we could take 'em?</b>

06:37.850 --> 06:39.690
<b>There are three things you 
aren't thinking about.</b>

06:39.690 --> 06:41.630
<b>What? Three?</b>

06:41.920 --> 06:44.750
<b>First, we probably can't find them.</b>

06:45.140 --> 06:48.540
<b>Up until now, even though 
we found the Nomu hangar,</b>

06:48.540 --> 06:50.820
<b>Shigaraki's hideout, and the research lab,</b>

06:50.820 --> 06:55.830
<b>ever since All Might defeated him, 
we've never once found All For One.</b>

06:56.190 --> 06:58.800
<b>He's the best in the world 
at running away and hiding.</b>

06:59.140 --> 07:00.750
<b>That ol' nutsack.</b>

07:00.750 --> 07:02.070
<b>I don't want to hear about nuts.</b>

07:02.550 --> 07:03.530
<b>Second--</b>

07:03.990 --> 07:09.250
<b>The Shigaraki we fought last 
time was incomplete, right?</b>

07:09.720 --> 07:13.070
<b>Considering how many people 
we've lost since then,</b>

07:13.070 --> 07:15.850
<b>it's tough to say if we're 
even a match for them now.</b>

07:15.850 --> 07:16.750
<b>Yeah.</b>

07:17.430 --> 07:18.740
<b>And third,</b>

07:19.190 --> 07:22.420
<b>their side can decide when we start.</b>

07:22.840 --> 07:24.540
<b>The Quirk stolen from Ragdoll,</b>

07:24.540 --> 07:27.840
<b>Search, which can find even faraway Quirks--</b>

07:28.260 --> 07:31.270
<b>Even if that Quirk was lost 
during his fight with America,</b>

07:31.600 --> 07:33.850
<b>going second likely means we're done for.</b>

07:34.190 --> 07:37.730
<b>That's probably why we're desperately 
throwing people at the problem now.</b>

07:39.430 --> 07:41.410
<b>That's why, at least for the first move...</b>

07:41.410 --> 07:45.540
<b>In order to lead Shigaraki and the others 
to where we want them, I need to hurry--</b>

07:45.930 --> 07:48.310
<b>You mean, "WE," right?</b>

07:50.270 --> 07:52.110
<b>Yeah, Midoriya!</b>

08:01.800 --> 08:02.540
<b>Yeah.</b>

08:04.920 --> 08:07.670
<b>Oh, speaking of which--</b>

08:07.670 --> 08:09.600
<b>It's okay to walk around, right?</b>

08:09.600 --> 08:13.470
<b>It should be fine for a bit. 
Thanks to Uraraka's speech,</b>

08:13.470 --> 08:17.100
<b>interactions between the hero course and 
the evacuees have gotten better, too.</b>

08:15.840 --> 08:17.100
<b>Embarrassed</b>

08:18.530 --> 08:23.380
<b>In the end, no matter how much 
we corner him, All For One...</b>

08:24.630 --> 08:26.210
<b>...keeps laughing.</b>

08:29.110 --> 08:31.640
<b>Ever since Gunga and Jaku,</b>

08:32.110 --> 08:33.590
<b>he's seemed down.</b>

08:34.390 --> 08:36.810
<b>That's true of everyone, but...</b>

08:37.420 --> 08:39.480
<b>You have no choice but to do it.</b>

08:39.480 --> 08:42.430
<b>We've gotten more instructions 
from that man.</b>

08:42.430 --> 08:43.630
<b>Don't worry.</b>

08:43.630 --> 08:47.460
<b>The messages are encoded as usual to look 
like normal messages between civilians</b>

08:47.460 --> 08:49.270
<b>in case they're intercepted.</b>

08:49.270 --> 08:52.170
<b>And this is a blind spot the surveillance 
cameras can't see, right?</b>

08:52.600 --> 08:54.300
<b>It's fine.</b>

08:54.300 --> 08:56.930
<b>Even after Midoriya came back,</b>

08:57.300 --> 09:00.550
<b>I was worried because you didn't smile...</b>

09:00.930 --> 09:05.340
<b>Everything's worked according to 
what All For One said until Camino!</b>

09:05.340 --> 09:08.270
<b>If you don't do this, we'll be killed!</b>

09:08.860 --> 09:10.250
<b>Yuga...!</b>

09:11.520 --> 09:15.870
<b>You were able to do what he asked right 
after you started school, right?</b>

09:15.870 --> 09:20.360
<b>And at the training camp, you let us know 
where you were without anyone finding out!</b>

09:21.420 --> 09:24.270
<b>The villains who showed 
up suddenly at USJ...</b>

09:25.020 --> 09:26.910
<b>And during the training camp in the woods,</b>

09:26.910 --> 09:29.990
<b>villains came even though they 
kept the location a secret...</b>

09:30.940 --> 09:32.000
<b>Don't tell me...</b>

09:32.640 --> 09:37.210
<b>We've never done this because we wanted to!</b>

09:37.210 --> 09:39.830
<b>But, it's too late now...</b>

09:39.830 --> 09:41.430
<b>It's much too late!</b>

09:42.210 --> 09:44.100
<b>Maman... Papa...</b>

09:44.720 --> 09:47.270
<b>But I...</b>

09:47.860 --> 09:50.460
<b>No, this can't be true.</b>

09:50.460 --> 09:54.060
<b>No way! Aoyama... Aoyama was...</b>

09:54.750 --> 09:59.840
<b>We just wanted you to be happy.</b>

10:00.250 --> 10:02.890
<b>Yuga, do you want to be like everyone else?</b>

10:02.890 --> 10:08.280
<b>Yes. I mean, it's very 
scary to be different.</b>

10:08.860 --> 10:13.370
<b>You were born without a Quirk, so in 
order to keep you from being excluded...</b>

10:13.930 --> 10:16.740
<b>So you could follow your 
dreams like everyone else...</b>

10:17.390 --> 10:19.580
<b>That's all we wanted for you.</b>

10:22.040 --> 10:24.400
<b>If I had known that this would happen,</b>

10:24.400 --> 10:26.770
<b>I wouldn't have done it! Definitely not.</b>

10:26.770 --> 10:29.660
<b>I wouldn't have taken a 
Quirk from All For One.</b>

10:30.100 --> 10:32.150
<b>But now that we're...</b>

10:33.270 --> 10:35.710
<b>involved with All For One...</b>

10:35.710 --> 10:38.450
<b>we can't run away from him!</b>

10:40.730 --> 10:41.860
<b>Someone...</b>

10:41.860 --> 10:43.280
<b>A teacher! Someone!</b>

10:44.610 --> 10:47.030
<b>It was... so hard...</b>

10:47.710 --> 10:51.240
<b>I always acted in a way to 
keep from getting caught.</b>

10:51.740 --> 10:54.010
<b>I would've been crushed by the guilt,</b>

10:55.270 --> 10:57.870
<b>so I always forced myself to be tough.</b>

10:59.260 --> 11:02.450
<b>When All For One was caught at Camino,</b>

11:02.970 --> 11:06.440
<b>I mistakenly thought...</b>

11:07.380 --> 11:10.320
<b>I could be the same as everyone else...</b>

11:10.320 --> 11:11.880
<b>Oh, Yuga!</b>

11:11.880 --> 11:13.470
<b>Please forgive us.</b>

11:13.470 --> 11:15.570
<b>Please forgive us for our foolishness.</b>

11:15.570 --> 11:18.850
<b>I want to protect you two!</b>

11:19.410 --> 11:21.480
<b>I don't want you to die!</b>

11:22.130 --> 11:24.760
<b>Yuga, please...</b>

11:24.760 --> 11:27.540
<b>Help us...</b>

11:27.540 --> 11:28.660
<b>Yuga!</b>

11:38.530 --> 11:42.730
<b>Um... I, uh, heard from Hagakure...</b>

11:43.330 --> 11:46.310
<b>that the spy...</b>

11:46.310 --> 11:47.850
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

11:47.850 --> 11:50.110
<b>This must all be a huge misunderstanding!</b>

11:51.450 --> 11:52.740
<b>Midoriya...</b>

11:54.100 --> 11:55.560
<b>Midoriya...</b>

11:56.610 --> 12:01.020
<b>Back then, I was the only one 
who couldn't say anything...</b>

12:02.270 --> 12:06.170
<b>While everyone else in our 
class called out to you...</b>

12:07.050 --> 12:10.320
<b>When everyone was desperately 
reaching out to you...</b>

12:11.200 --> 12:13.960
<b>Back then, I was the only one...</b>

12:15.840 --> 12:18.270
<b>Aoyama, I--</b>

12:18.270 --> 12:19.180
<b>Stop.</b>

12:19.960 --> 12:25.890
<b>"My power is a special power that 
I received from All Might"...</b>

12:26.490 --> 12:27.590
<b>You were...</b>

12:28.090 --> 12:31.350
<b>I always wanted to be an equal...</b>

12:31.720 --> 12:32.960
<b>You were...</b>

12:33.440 --> 12:34.030
<b>I--</b>

12:34.980 --> 12:41.240
<b>I thought something was wrong since you 
were the only one who still looked sad,</b>

12:41.240 --> 12:42.640
<b>so I came to look for you.</b>

12:45.140 --> 12:48.870
<b>Yes, I was the only one...</b>

12:53.160 --> 12:55.740
<b>At USJ and the training camp...</b>

12:55.740 --> 12:56.740
<b>Yuga!</b>

12:57.120 --> 12:59.080
<b>I led them to us.</b>

13:00.320 --> 13:03.080
<b>Midoriya, I...</b>

13:04.120 --> 13:06.000
<b>am a terrible villain.</b>

13:08.600 --> 13:10.970
<b>Yuga Aoyama</b>

13:12.600 --> 13:14.980
<b>Izuku Midoriya</b>

13:19.190 --> 13:21.500
<b>...unlike you, Toya...</b>

13:21.500 --> 13:23.520
<b>I have many friends.</b>

13:23.520 --> 13:25.020
<b>Friends, huh?</b>

13:25.530 --> 13:29.300
<b>Won't it be bad for us 
if they're found out?</b>

13:29.300 --> 13:30.750
<b>That won't happen.</b>

13:31.280 --> 13:36.000
<b>If a 100-yen lighter stops 
working, what do you do?</b>

13:36.850 --> 13:39.600
<b>If they succeed, I'm happy.</b>

13:39.600 --> 13:40.950
<b>But if it doesn't work,</b>

13:40.950 --> 13:43.610
<b>I'll just be disappointed and 
think, "Oh, that didn't work,"</b>

13:43.610 --> 13:46.550
<b>and move on to my next route.</b>

13:47.250 --> 13:50.610
<b>They're nothing more than disposable tools.</b>

13:51.250 --> 13:56.270
<b>If they let me have a bit 
of fun, that's great.</b>

13:56.270 --> 13:57.090
<b>Yuga!</b>

13:57.090 --> 13:57.860
<b>Run!</b>

13:57.860 --> 13:58.700
<b>Wait!</b>

14:00.430 --> 14:05.150
<b>Maman and Papa were both dismayed 
that I was Quirkless.</b>

14:05.910 --> 14:08.800
<b>The two of them were wealthy,</b>

14:08.800 --> 14:11.910
<b>and were raised without want for anything.</b>

14:12.320 --> 14:17.930
<b>I'm sure they were more worried about 
me being different than I was.</b>

14:18.450 --> 14:24.460
<b>So they were probably desperately 
wishing for my happiness</b>

14:25.190 --> 14:30.170
<b>when they followed rumors of someone 
who could give Quirks freely.</b>

14:32.640 --> 14:36.850
<b>Gurgle</b>

14:32.960 --> 14:36.850
<b>The Quirk I received wasn't a good 
fit for my body, so it was hard.</b>

14:36.890 --> 14:38.480
<b>Surprise!</b>

14:38.980 --> 14:44.160
<b>Maman and Papa went through 
a lot in order to raise me.</b>

14:45.240 --> 14:47.810
<b>Because I was very afraid 
of being different.</b>

14:48.460 --> 14:51.340
<b>My dream, which started 
from a desire to conform,</b>

14:51.990 --> 14:55.640
<b>is to one day do what Maman 
and Papa did for me...</b>

14:57.320 --> 15:00.590
<b>There's a rumor that All Might 
is going to be a teacher.</b>

15:00.590 --> 15:02.880
<b>Put him in U.A.</b>

15:02.880 --> 15:04.390
<b>For others...</b>

15:04.780 --> 15:08.710
<b>Tell me when the class is unsupervised.</b>

15:08.710 --> 15:10.560
<b>To make people happy...</b>

15:10.890 --> 15:13.560
<b>Tell me where the training 
camp is being held.</b>

15:13.560 --> 15:15.750
<b>For everyone's sake, I--</b>

15:15.750 --> 15:21.790
<b>Once Izuku Midoriya's back at U.A., 
lure him out so he's alone.</b>

15:22.800 --> 15:27.370
<b>When I found out that you were 
Quirkless like me from that letter,</b>

15:28.550 --> 15:29.200
<b>I...</b>

15:30.490 --> 15:31.730
<b>...despaired...</b>

15:31.730 --> 15:33.950
<b>Stop that, Aoyama!</b>

15:32.780 --> 15:34.870
<b>...about everything!</b>

15:35.640 --> 15:36.690
<b>Navel...</b>

15:37.680 --> 15:39.320
<b>One For All...</b>

15:39.320 --> 15:40.530
<b>...Laser!</b>

15:45.570 --> 15:50.020
<b>My body refracts light.</b>

15:51.860 --> 15:54.500
<b>We all could've died.</b>

15:55.570 --> 15:58.180
<b>All of Japan is in trouble.</b>

15:59.840 --> 16:02.610
<b>What were you thinking 
when you were in class?!</b>

16:02.970 --> 16:06.190
<b>At the dorms! When you were 
living with all of us!</b>

16:06.190 --> 16:08.020
<b>Well, Aoyama?</b>

16:08.020 --> 16:08.970
<b>It's not like that!</b>

16:08.970 --> 16:09.820
<b>Yuga's not--</b>

16:15.220 --> 16:16.360
<b>Aoyama...</b>

16:16.910 --> 16:23.800
<b>Hagakure made it so you don't 
have to hurt others anymore.</b>

16:24.520 --> 16:26.790
<b>So, stop this.</b>

16:27.280 --> 16:32.090
<b>Stop doing this already...</b>

16:38.910 --> 16:40.460
<b>I see.</b>

16:40.790 --> 16:45.750
<b>So he received a Quirk from All For 
One and was then controlled by him.</b>

16:46.250 --> 16:48.960
<b>He must have received the 
Quirk about ten years ago.</b>

16:49.620 --> 16:51.500
<b>The fact that he's fine right now 
means that there wasn't anything</b>

16:51.500 --> 16:55.470
<b>like what Nagant had that would trigger 
an explosion if he betrayed All For One.</b>

16:55.470 --> 16:58.160
<b>We can say conclusively now--</b>

16:56.320 --> 16:58.160
<b>U.A.'s Great Failure</b>

16:58.510 --> 17:01.040
<b>There's a traitor among us, isn't there?</b>

17:01.620 --> 17:04.080
<b>I can't believe it was a student.</b>

17:06.090 --> 17:09.670
<b>If possible, I'd like you kids to leave...</b>

17:09.980 --> 17:11.960
<b>Like we could do that.</b>

17:11.960 --> 17:13.640
<b>It doesn't make sense.</b>

17:14.450 --> 17:18.500
<b>If Hagakure hadn't found you, 
what would you have done?</b>

17:18.970 --> 17:20.340
<b>Aoyama...</b>

17:20.340 --> 17:22.470
<b>Aoyama! Say it isn't true!</b>

17:22.780 --> 17:24.350
<b>You were tricked, weren't you?</b>

17:24.640 --> 17:26.480
<b>You weren't doing it on purpose, were you?</b>

17:27.110 --> 17:29.780
<b>To think that you were also 
formerly Quirkless...</b>

17:29.780 --> 17:31.830
<b>It's a small world.</b>

17:33.000 --> 17:36.830
<b>Unfortunately, we're still trying 
to restore a state of order.</b>

17:37.170 --> 17:41.130
<b>Tell us everything you 
know about All For One.</b>

17:41.820 --> 17:44.170
<b>We don't know anything.</b>

17:44.750 --> 17:48.760
<b>We just acted when we were told.</b>

17:49.330 --> 17:51.350
<b>If we failed, we would be killed.</b>

17:51.350 --> 17:53.640
<b>If we lied, we would be killed.</b>

17:54.120 --> 17:55.260
<b>How?</b>

17:55.960 --> 17:57.810
<b>We were shown...</b>

17:57.810 --> 18:00.840
<b>what happened to those who did it...</b>

18:01.660 --> 18:06.380
<b>Those who ran to the police... 
were killed after they left.</b>

18:06.380 --> 18:08.000
<b>They couldn't escape.</b>

18:08.710 --> 18:11.640
<b>No matter where they went, 
he would find them.</b>

18:11.640 --> 18:14.760
<b>Death would find them no matter what.</b>

18:15.500 --> 18:19.260
<b>Yuga didn't know what would 
happen if we did what he said.</b>

18:19.260 --> 18:22.720
<b>We just told him not to 
be found out by anyone.</b>

18:23.180 --> 18:25.280
<b>We are the ones at fault.</b>

18:25.780 --> 18:28.240
<b>What were you thinking 
when you were in class?!</b>

18:30.040 --> 18:34.170
<b>With the people I could've killed...</b>

18:35.240 --> 18:38.380
<b>I smiled and laughed like we were friends.</b>

18:39.290 --> 18:41.440
<b>I couldn't help it.</b>

18:42.190 --> 18:44.320
<b>Finding out that he used 
to be Quirkless like me,</b>

18:44.320 --> 18:47.970
<b>and that he bore the pressure of 
fighting against All For One,</b>

18:49.200 --> 18:52.130
<b>I despaired at how miserable I was.</b>

18:52.680 --> 18:54.900
<b>And I despaired at myself,</b>

18:55.620 --> 18:59.880
<b>who despaired before worrying about 
whether or not he was okay.</b>

19:01.000 --> 19:03.940
<b>I'm rotten to the core...</b>

19:04.490 --> 19:08.280
<b>Yuga Aoyama is a villain 
through and through.</b>

19:08.280 --> 19:13.840
<b>Then why did you try to save Kacchan 
and Tokoyami at the training camp?</b>

19:16.510 --> 19:18.530
<b>Did you leave the cheese that night</b>

19:18.010 --> 19:20.930
<b>I know</b>

19:18.530 --> 19:20.940
<b>because All For One told you to?</b>

19:21.670 --> 19:23.670
<b>If you only face painful things,</b>

19:23.990 --> 19:25.800
<b>then you won't be able to twinkle!</b>

19:25.800 --> 19:27.520
<b>That's not it, is it?</b>

19:28.650 --> 19:34.560
<b>That was an S.O.S. from you 
that I didn't notice...</b>

19:35.340 --> 19:36.470
<b>I mean...</b>

19:37.780 --> 19:40.990
<b>You're crying right now without 
a thought for decorum</b>

19:40.990 --> 19:45.360
<b>not because you care that you couldn't do 
what All For One told you to do, right?</b>

19:45.770 --> 19:49.000
<b>I know a hero who didn't 
give All For One everything</b>

19:49.000 --> 19:52.290
<b>even when he was using her.</b>

19:53.080 --> 19:55.200
<b>It was just that her spirit was crushed.</b>

19:56.080 --> 19:57.770
<b>Young Midoriya...</b>

19:57.770 --> 20:02.180
<b>Just because you commit a crime 
doesn't make you a villain for life!</b>

20:02.930 --> 20:05.890
<b>Take my hand, Aoyama.</b>

20:06.210 --> 20:07.650
<b>That's it, Deku!</b>

20:08.310 --> 20:12.560
<b>Because you can still be a hero!</b>

20:13.300 --> 20:14.940
<b>Wait, Midoriya.</b>

20:14.940 --> 20:19.000
<b>Sansa, gag Aoyama. He's still in custody.</b>

20:19.000 --> 20:20.270
<b>He can't take your hand.</b>

20:20.580 --> 20:24.710
<b>No matter the situation, it won't erase 
the fact that he helped All For One.</b>

20:25.100 --> 20:28.650
<b>Besides, we can only assume that he's 
safe based on the current situation,</b>

20:28.650 --> 20:31.540
<b>but we can't say for sure that what 
happened to Nagant won't happen to him.</b>

20:32.140 --> 20:37.220
<b>We shouldn't let him speak anymore until 
we get the results from Central Hospital.</b>

20:41.840 --> 20:43.620
<b>Mr. and Mrs. Aoyama,</b>

20:44.140 --> 20:48.210
<b>why didn't you report that we 
were going to attack Camino?</b>

20:48.780 --> 20:51.570
<b>We cannot contact him ourselves.</b>

20:51.570 --> 20:53.660
<b>Only when he wants to contact us</b>

20:53.660 --> 20:59.120
<b>are we provided with contact information, 
which changes each time.</b>

20:59.120 --> 21:02.170
<b>So we wouldn't be able to use you to 
get to him if you were caught, huh?</b>

21:02.170 --> 21:02.930
<b>Then--</b>

21:02.930 --> 21:03.870
<b>Detective Tsukauchi--</b>

21:05.890 --> 21:08.640
<b>All For One is nowhere to be found.</b>

21:08.640 --> 21:11.550
<b>That's one way of looking at 
our current situation, right?</b>

21:13.510 --> 21:15.910
<b>...going second likely 
means we're done for.</b>

21:15.910 --> 21:19.130
<b>That's probably why we're desperately 
throwing people at the problem now.</b>

21:21.540 --> 21:23.090
<b>That's why, at least...</b>

21:23.560 --> 21:27.880
<b>At least for the first move, we can make 
Shigaraki and the others move the way we want!</b>

21:28.950 --> 21:29.890
<b>I see!</b>

21:30.160 --> 21:31.610
<b>If we look at it differently,</b>

21:31.610 --> 21:34.910
<b>the current situation is that Aoyama</b>

21:34.910 --> 21:38.150
<b>is the only one who may be 
able to trick All For One!</b>

21:40.850 --> 21:43.990
<b>Aoyama, I'll say it one more time.</b>

21:44.840 --> 21:48.710
<b>You can still be a hero!</b>

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
<b>Preview</b>

23:20.630 --> 23:21.990
<b>Here's the preview!</b>

23:22.300 --> 23:23.800
<b>I know.</b>

23:23.800 --> 23:26.330
<b>Heroes don't have to give 
All For One everything</b>

23:26.330 --> 23:28.890
<b>even when he is using them.</b>

23:29.200 --> 23:33.060
<b>In a heart dyed in darkness, 
there can still be light.</b>

23:33.060 --> 23:37.450
<b>Even if you're defeated, 
you can stand up again.</b>

23:38.360 --> 23:41.620
<b>Next time, "The Story of 
How We All Became Heroes."</b>

23:42.250 --> 23:45.990
<b>Aoyama, we're not alone.</b>

23:45.980 --> 23:49.980
<b>Next time: The Story of How We All Became Heroes</b>

23:46.820 --> 23:48.250
<b>Go beyond!</b>

23:48.250 --> 23:49.720
<b>Plus Ultra!</b>
