<b>Warp-sama?</b>

02:43.160 --> 02:46.490
<b>It's a transit point between

02:53.130 --> 02:56.590
<b>Where is the closest Warp-sama to Earth?</b>

02:58.210 --> 02:59.590
<b>I think…</b>

<b>Near Planet Batapi of… the Rakka System.</b>

03:03.970 --> 03:06.810
<b>I see. So there was one there.</b>

03:10.690 --> 03:11.940
<b>Glorio-san.</b>

03:12.020 --> 03:16.480
<b>You said you were asked to

<b>Yes.</b>

03:17.690 --> 03:20.070
<b>The Demon King of
the Third Demon World asked me</b>

03:20.150 --> 03:21.990
<b>so that King Gomah could be defeated.</b>

03:22.700 --> 03:27.370
<b>So, just how strong is
that King Tamah guy?</b>

03:27.450 --> 03:28.870
<b>It's King Gomah.</b>

03:29.500 --> 03:33.370
<b>He's small, but he's crafty
and has amazing Magic Power.</b>

03:34.080 --> 03:39.260
<b>But, you defeated Majin Buu.
You should be able to defeat King Gomah.</b>

03:39.340 --> 03:45.970
<b>Right! We need to hurry and rescue Dende
and return to normal, too.</b>

03:46.050 --> 03:48.430
<b>Right, Supreme Kai-sama?</b>

03:54.150 --> 03:56.730
<b>This is Planet Batapi.</b>

03:56.810 --> 03:58.110
<b>Oh?</b>

03:58.190 --> 04:02.570
<b>Could you stop here a moment?
I need to relay this location to Kibito.</b>

04:03.200 --> 04:04.530
<b>All right.</b>

04:08.490 --> 04:10.750
<b>Thank you. Let's go.</b>

04:17.130 --> 04:18.880
<b>What the heck is that?</b>

04:19.630 --> 04:21.590
<b>That's Warp-sama.</b>

04:21.670 --> 04:23.550
<b>Wow.</b>

04:26.590 --> 04:28.640
<b>Whoa!</b>

04:30.140 --> 04:32.060
<b>It looks like a giant goldfish!</b>

04:38.400 --> 04:39.400
<b>Heya, big goldfish!</b>

04:40.400 --> 04:41.860
<b>I'm not a goldfish!</b>

04:41.940 --> 04:44.700
<b>Nah, you're totally a big goldfish!</b>

04:44.780 --> 04:47.280
<b>Don't call me a goldfish!</b>

04:49.240 --> 04:50.620
<b>Yeah, but…!</b>

04:50.700 --> 04:52.910
<b>Shush, Goku-san!</b>

04:53.500 --> 04:56.210
<b>You mustn't agitate Warp-sama.</b>

04:56.290 --> 04:59.290
<b>If it doesn't like you,
you might not be allowed through.</b>

04:59.380 --> 05:00.670
<b>What?</b>

05:00.750 --> 05:03.720
<b>They say Warp-sama is rather sensitive.</b>

05:03.800 --> 05:07.800
<b>If you tease Warp-sama for looking like
a goldfish, you could draw ire.</b>

05:07.890 --> 05:11.430
<b>-Huh.
-What are you whispering about?</b>

05:11.510 --> 05:13.390
<b>N-Nothing!</b>

05:13.470 --> 05:17.310
<b>Then if you ain't just a goldfish,
are you a popeyed goldfish?</b>

05:18.310 --> 05:21.070
<b>A popeyed goldfish is a goldfish!</b>

05:21.150 --> 05:22.980
<b>S-Sorry!</b>

05:23.780 --> 05:27.160
<b>Shh! Goku-san, please be quiet.</b>

05:27.240 --> 05:31.370
<b>Who are you? Identify yourselves.</b>

05:31.990 --> 05:35.000
<b>I am Glorio.
I passed through here recently.</b>

05:35.580 --> 05:39.420
<b>You have more people. Who are those two?</b>

05:39.500 --> 05:41.670
<b>Ah, they're of the Demon Realm.</b>

05:43.630 --> 05:46.010
<b>Let me see your ears.</b>

05:46.800 --> 05:47.970
<b>Here.</b>

05:48.050 --> 05:51.930
<b>Hmm… They're properly pointed.</b>

05:52.010 --> 05:54.680
<b>You're definitely from the Demon Realm.</b>

05:55.270 --> 05:56.890
<b>And that one?</b>

05:57.810 --> 05:58.770
<b>Uh-oh…</b>

05:59.690 --> 06:02.230
<b>Ow, ow, ow…</b>

06:09.160 --> 06:12.660
<b>Very well. Now just say the pin number.</b>

06:13.580 --> 06:14.950
<b>Pin number?</b>

06:15.040 --> 06:16.700
<b>To use Warp-sama,</b>

06:16.790 --> 06:20.460
<b>one must hand in an application beforehand
and receive a pin number.</b>

06:20.540 --> 06:23.880
<b>There didn't used to be a pin number.</b>

06:23.960 --> 06:26.340
<b>Hurry up!</b>

06:26.420 --> 06:28.470
<b>8821.</b>

06:29.090 --> 06:31.260
<b>All right. Enter.</b>

06:32.300 --> 06:33.180
<b>Whoa?!</b>

06:35.560 --> 06:37.020
<b>That's neat!</b>

06:42.020 --> 06:46.980
<b>O-Oh no! I need to tell Kibito
about the pin number!</b>

06:54.620 --> 06:56.490
<b>Oh no! There's no time!</b>

07:00.540 --> 07:01.960
<b>W-What's that?!</b>

07:05.040 --> 07:08.510
<b>I think what I ate earlier's
comin' back up!</b>

07:21.350 --> 07:22.310
<b>Are you okay?</b>

07:25.310 --> 07:28.320
<b>Sure. That was fun.</b>

07:29.240 --> 07:31.070
<b>Please don't vomit.</b>

07:32.240 --> 07:33.740
<b>Are we in the Demon Realm?</b>

07:34.320 --> 07:36.700
<b>No. This is just a relay point.</b>

07:37.740 --> 07:40.250
<b>The Demon Realm is divided
into three worlds.</b>

07:43.040 --> 07:47.170
<b>The first hatch can only be entered by
palace members of the First Demon World.</b>

07:47.960 --> 07:50.380
<b>We're entering through the third hatch.</b>

07:50.470 --> 07:51.720
<b>The third hatch?</b>

07:52.510 --> 07:56.100
<b>That's the farthest from
the First Demon World where Gomah is.</b>

07:56.640 --> 07:58.760
<b>Shouldn't we at least
go through the second?</b>

07:59.350 --> 08:02.230
<b>I only got clearance for
the Third Demon World.</b>

08:02.890 --> 08:04.440
<b>Seriously?</b>

08:05.560 --> 08:06.440
<b>Huh?</b>

08:06.520 --> 08:09.070
<b>A tiny thing appeared.</b>

08:10.860 --> 08:12.570
<b>Heading back to the Demon World?</b>

08:12.650 --> 08:13.820
<b>That's right.</b>

08:13.910 --> 08:16.490
<b>Okay! Then get a move on!</b>

08:28.670 --> 08:31.010
<b>Huh?! Not again!</b>

08:57.820 --> 08:59.580
<b>Are we there?</b>

09:00.790 --> 09:04.250
<b>Yes. This is the Third Demon World.</b>

09:04.330 --> 09:07.420
<b>Whoa!</b>

09:08.290 --> 09:09.710
<b>So this is it!</b>

09:20.850 --> 09:23.390
<b>Ain't this amazin', Supreme Kai-sama?!</b>

09:23.470 --> 09:24.680
<b>Y-Yes.</b>

09:25.690 --> 09:29.520
<b>I couldn't tell Kibito the pin number.</b>

09:30.230 --> 09:32.530
<b>Well, I'm sure it'll work out.</b>

09:32.610 --> 09:34.740
<b>You're as nonchalant as ever.</b>

09:39.780 --> 09:42.950
<b>Whoa! What's this place?!</b>

09:43.040 --> 09:44.950
<b>That's the Demon Realm Tunnel.</b>

09:45.040 --> 09:47.960
<b>It's a hole path.</b>

09:48.040 --> 09:49.880
<b>Beyond it is the Second Demon World</b>

09:49.960 --> 09:52.420
<b>and beyond that is the First Demon World.</b>

09:53.050 --> 09:56.220
<b>Long ago one could freely go
between Demon Worlds,</b>

09:56.300 --> 09:58.430
<b>but by the time I was young,</b>

09:58.510 --> 10:03.970
<b>someone had placed a shield of light
over it, preventing passage.</b>

10:04.560 --> 10:06.980
<b>So we can't use that hole, huh?</b>

10:07.060 --> 10:08.350
<b>That's right.</b>

10:08.890 --> 10:14.190
<b>That's why Warp-sama has to be used to
travel between the Demon Worlds.</b>

10:14.780 --> 10:18.570
<b>But the only ones who can use Warp-sama
are people of the First Demon World</b>

10:18.650 --> 10:21.530
<b>and select members of
the Second Demon World.</b>

10:21.620 --> 10:24.080
<b>So how is that you can use Warp-sama?</b>

10:24.910 --> 10:28.540
<b>From the look of things, you seem to be
from the Third Demon World.</b>

10:30.330 --> 10:33.590
<b>I do work in the First Demon World.</b>

10:33.670 --> 10:37.050
<b>Really? What sort of work?</b>

10:38.590 --> 10:40.260
<b>This and that.</b>

10:43.510 --> 10:44.430
<b>Huh?</b>

10:44.510 --> 10:47.020
<b>-There's somethin' there.
-Huh?</b>

10:47.100 --> 10:50.480
<b>Ah, that's the previous king, Dabura.</b>

10:51.600 --> 10:53.360
<b>You're right.</b>

10:54.270 --> 10:56.400
<b>But it's in poor shape.</b>

11:06.410 --> 11:08.290
<b>The sky looks funny.</b>

11:08.370 --> 11:11.500
<b>It's a different from Earth's sky,
so it may seem unfamiliar.</b>

11:12.080 --> 11:16.210
<b>When I heard "the Demon Realm,"
I thought it'd be more creepy,</b>

11:16.960 --> 11:19.220
<b>but it's not that different from Earth.</b>

11:19.920 --> 11:23.720
<b>It may seem so, but it has an entirely
different ecology.</b>

11:23.800 --> 11:27.640
<b>There are plants and animals
you've never seen before.</b>

11:28.310 --> 11:32.100
<b>The lands in the Third Demon World
float like that.</b>

11:32.900 --> 11:35.690
<b>Hey, uh, you…</b>

11:35.770 --> 11:36.730
<b>It's Glorio.</b>

11:36.820 --> 11:41.320
<b>I wanna breathe some of the outside air.
Could you let us down?</b>

11:43.410 --> 11:44.450
<b>Very well.</b>

11:51.620 --> 11:53.170
<b>Hup!</b>

11:56.040 --> 11:58.460
<b>So this is the Demon Realm!</b>

12:11.600 --> 12:13.770
<b>Something smells kinda bad.</b>

12:14.400 --> 12:15.810
<b>And…</b>

12:22.820 --> 12:28.530
<b>It's like the air's all stuffy
and makes it hard to move.</b>

12:28.620 --> 12:32.580
<b>That's the gas covering the area.
It makes the air heavy.</b>

12:32.660 --> 12:33.660
<b>Gas?</b>

12:34.250 --> 12:37.040
<b>Don't worry. It's harmless.</b>

12:37.130 --> 12:38.000
<b>Okay.</b>

12:48.350 --> 12:51.640
<b>This is my first time in
the Third Demon World.</b>

12:51.720 --> 12:53.770
<b>You're a Glind, aren't you?</b>

12:53.850 --> 12:55.600
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>

12:55.690 --> 13:01.070
<b>If memory serves, many Glind used to live
in the Second Demon World.</b>

13:02.150 --> 13:05.400
<b>I'm sure you and your sophisticated kind
never had any reason</b>

13:05.490 --> 13:07.200
<b>to come to the Third Demon World.</b>

13:12.750 --> 13:14.410
<b>Whoa!</b>

13:15.710 --> 13:17.830
<b>Hey! Watch out!</b>

13:17.920 --> 13:21.800
<b>If you fall into the Sea of Darkness
below, you'll perish instantly!</b>

13:25.800 --> 13:28.970
<b>Whew! That's pretty scary.</b>

14:03.920 --> 14:05.210
<b>They're slow?</b>

14:05.800 --> 14:07.680
<b>I told you that the air is heavy!</b>

14:08.550 --> 14:09.390
<b>Here they come!</b>

14:12.050 --> 14:13.140
<b>What the heck?!</b>

14:25.320 --> 14:26.900
<b>They're just bandits.</b>

14:26.990 --> 14:29.610
<b>Wow, this place is dangerous.</b>

14:30.360 --> 14:33.330
<b>Let's get going.
We still have a ways to go.</b>

14:35.580 --> 14:36.750
<b>Glorio-san.</b>

14:37.370 --> 14:40.420
<b>Where are we going to go now?</b>

14:40.500 --> 14:41.500
<b>A town.</b>

14:41.580 --> 14:45.130
<b>Tonight we'll stay in a hotel.
Tomorrow I'll take you to see King Kadan.</b>

14:45.210 --> 14:48.840
<b>You mean the king who sent you
as a secret envoy?</b>

14:48.920 --> 14:50.090
<b>Yes.</b>

14:57.850 --> 15:00.350
<b>We seem to be flying rather slow.</b>

15:00.440 --> 15:04.190
<b>If we fly fast, the air resistance will
break the plane's machinery.</b>

15:04.270 --> 15:08.400
<b>Check it out.
There's a weird volcano over there.</b>

15:09.070 --> 15:13.870
<b>You're right. It's floating but it's a
volcano. How interesting.</b>

15:13.950 --> 15:18.370
<b>The gas that volcano spews makes the air
heavy.</b>

15:19.080 --> 15:21.750
<b>There are volcanos all over this area.</b>

15:22.330 --> 15:24.210
<b>So that's why it stinks.</b>

15:24.290 --> 15:26.710
<b>I could probably fart and nobody'd notice.</b>

15:27.670 --> 15:29.090
<b>That's being crude.</b>

15:30.130 --> 15:33.300
<b>The thicker the gas is,
the heavier the air becomes.</b>

15:33.890 --> 15:38.060
<b>Because of that, it's difficult to fly
planes near volcanos.</b>

15:38.770 --> 15:39.930
<b>I see.</b>

15:41.020 --> 15:42.390
<b>Whoa!</b>

15:45.940 --> 15:47.650
<b>Whew! That surprised me.</b>

15:47.730 --> 15:49.570
<b>It's just a minor gas emission.</b>

15:51.990 --> 15:53.530
<b>The smell seems to have increased.</b>

15:56.370 --> 15:59.370
<b>Sorry, sorry. You got me.</b>

16:05.540 --> 16:09.460
<b>It was night on Earth,
so you must be getting sleepy.</b>

16:10.340 --> 16:12.220
<b>We'll spend the night around here.</b>

16:15.140 --> 16:16.470
<b>Thank goodness.</b>

16:42.580 --> 16:43.500
<b>You guests?</b>

16:44.120 --> 16:45.370
<b>Yes.</b>

16:45.460 --> 16:47.790
<b>Will you two be okay in the same room?</b>

16:47.880 --> 16:49.840
<b>Yes. That's fine.</b>

16:52.670 --> 16:53.840
<b>Do you have two rooms?</b>

16:54.590 --> 16:58.970
<b>Sure I do. That'll be
30,000 Dokuro a room.</b>

16:59.050 --> 17:02.310
<b>30,000? That seems rather exorbitant.</b>

17:03.680 --> 17:07.060
<b>If you don't like it,
you can go somewhere else.</b>

17:07.150 --> 17:12.650
<b>Too bad this is
the only hotel in the region.</b>

17:12.740 --> 17:14.360
<b>I'd watch myself if I was you.</b>

17:15.070 --> 17:16.740
<b>What are you doing?</b>

17:20.240 --> 17:23.200
<b>I get it! How about 5,000?!</b>

17:24.330 --> 17:25.160
<b>That'll do.</b>

17:33.460 --> 17:36.720
<b>Our rooms are upstairs.
I'll come for you in the morning.</b>

17:36.800 --> 17:37.840
<b>I understand.</b>

17:38.510 --> 17:42.850
<b>Hey, we left while I was still eatin',
so I'm hungry.</b>

17:42.930 --> 17:44.850
<b>Can we get somethin' to eat?</b>

17:44.930 --> 17:48.310
<b>Huh?! You ate all of that
and you're still…?</b>

17:49.060 --> 17:50.940
<b>Hey. Do you offer food?</b>

17:52.480 --> 17:54.780
<b>Uh, there's a bar across the street.</b>

17:54.860 --> 17:57.860
<b>They probably have
hamburgers or something.</b>

18:13.460 --> 18:16.090
<b>A hamburger… Is one enough?</b>

18:17.670 --> 18:20.220
<b>I already ate a bit so…</b>

18:20.840 --> 18:21.930
<b>I'll take five!</b>

18:23.850 --> 18:26.810
<b>-Do you want a drink?
-A little.</b>

18:27.480 --> 18:29.770
<b>Give us five hamburgers and two drinks.</b>

18:39.030 --> 18:42.740
<b>Demon World hamburgers are pretty yummy.</b>

18:44.160 --> 18:46.450
<b>What meat is this?</b>

18:47.330 --> 18:48.910
<b>Don't ask.</b>

18:52.080 --> 18:54.290
<b>-Hey kid.
-Hm?</b>

18:54.380 --> 18:57.130
<b>You got round ears.</b>

18:57.210 --> 18:59.510
<b>You ain't from the Demon Realm, are you?</b>

19:01.550 --> 19:04.430
<b>We're eating. Get lost.</b>

19:05.140 --> 19:09.270
<b>What? You seem awful full of yourself,
don't you?</b>

19:10.270 --> 19:13.020
<b>Didn't you hear me say to get lost?</b>

19:13.110 --> 19:15.690
<b>What? What was that?!</b>

19:19.150 --> 19:20.320
<b>Say that again!</b>

19:23.780 --> 19:25.160
<b>Wh-Why you…!</b>

19:25.950 --> 19:27.080
<b>Ow, ow, ow!</b>

19:35.920 --> 19:38.590
<b>-Another.
-Y-Yessir!</b>

19:38.670 --> 19:41.300
<b>Oh man, my hamburger…</b>

19:41.380 --> 19:43.010
<b>Why you…!</b>

19:43.090 --> 19:44.220
<b>What?!</b>

19:58.030 --> 19:58.900
<b>Darn it!</b>

19:59.780 --> 20:01.740
<b>You little…!</b>

20:09.870 --> 20:11.540
<b>It's hard to move!</b>

20:15.750 --> 20:19.050
<b>Why you…! Stop messing around!</b>

20:23.630 --> 20:25.640
<b>Maybe that should be enough?</b>

20:37.230 --> 20:38.770
<b>Is that allowed?!</b>

20:38.860 --> 20:41.070
<b>Anything goes!</b>

20:55.870 --> 20:58.250
<b>This'll help to get used to this air.</b>

20:58.960 --> 21:01.210
<b>I'll take you all on!</b>

21:01.300 --> 21:03.670
<b>You snotty little…!</b>

21:27.740 --> 21:28.820
<b>Huh?!</b>

21:28.910 --> 21:33.790
<b>I think I'm gettin' the hang of my smaller
body's balance and sense of distance.</b>

21:34.370 --> 21:36.540
<b>Yes. That should be enough.</b>

21:38.630 --> 21:41.130
<b>My belly still hasn't had enough, though.</b>

21:42.000 --> 21:44.920
<b>-Another hamburger.
-Y-Yes! Right away!</b>

21:58.350 --> 22:00.110
<b>We'll show them!</b>

22:11.990 --> 22:13.160
<b>Let's go.</b>

22:21.630 --> 22:24.420
<b>Glorio-san, is something wrong?</b>

22:25.130 --> 22:26.880
<b>My plane…</b>

22:28.380 --> 22:29.220
<b>Huh?</b>

22:31.510 --> 22:32.970
<b>Did they…?!</b>

22:36.180 --> 22:37.430
<b>Huh?</b>

22:42.730 --> 22:44.650
<b><i>Holding out my hand</i></b>

22:46.400 --> 22:48.320
<b><i>Up to the sky</i></b>

22:50.200 --> 22:52.740
<b><i>The moment is ours</i></b>

22:53.370 --> 22:56.790
<b><i>Make a miracle happen</i></b>

22:56.870 --> 23:03.040
<b><i>Like a bird with open wings we fly</i></b>

23:03.130 --> 23:06.880
<b><i>Picking up</i></b>

23:06.960 --> 23:10.260
<b><i>Those pieces of hope</i></b>

23:11.300 --> 23:17.220
<b><i>There's no giving up</i></b>

23:17.810 --> 23:22.060
<b><i>Go as far as we can</i></b>

23:22.150 --> 23:25.690
<b><i>I got you by my side</i></b>

23:25.770 --> 23:28.780
<b><i>Run, run, run</i></b>

23:28.860 --> 23:32.360
<b><i>Over the mountain we go</i></b>

23:32.450 --> 23:36.200
<b><i>I hear it always</i>
<i>Your voice in my heart</i></b>

23:36.280 --> 23:40.620
<b><i>"You know that we're never alone"</i></b>

23:41.670 --> 23:46.590
<b>CHATTY</b>
