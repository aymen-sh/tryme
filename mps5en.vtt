00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:27.803
If this is all true, tonight...

00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:31.123
that is, two nights before
the student teacher dies,

00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:34.083
there was an incident where
she suddenly disappeared.

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:36.943
Thankfully, a townsperson found her.

00:00:36.943 --> 00:00:39.583
It was revealed that
she simply lost her way

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:43.093
so it ended as a small
happening. But actually,

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:46.233
she looked like she was
being chased by someone.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:57.683
Do you know where they found her?

00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:00.333
By the river.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:04.193
If it's the closest place from the bus station
and village office, it should be about here.

doing? You all want to die?

00:03:04.043 --> 00:03:07.303
Mr. Yoon Hae Joon, it's you again!

00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:09.153
Shit.

00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:14.593
It's not enough that you failed once. You
want to repeat it two or three more times!

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:32.573
You released Go Min Soo?

00:03:32.573 --> 00:03:34.053
Why?

00:03:35.973 --> 00:03:38.713
I just followed orders.

00:03:40.713 --> 00:03:43.813
That's a very responsible thing to say.

00:03:43.813 --> 00:03:46.583
Since this is the way you conduct things...

00:03:52.613 --> 00:03:57.803
This one mistake must end
now, Detective Baek Dong Shik.

00:03:57.803 --> 00:03:59.823
If we're not lucky,

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:04.913
someone's life is in danger again
because of the punk you released tonight.

00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:09.483
Was it Go Min Soo just now?

00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:10.943
No way. Could he have again...

00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:16.733
No matter what he does, you
guys have nothing to say. Right?

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:19.753
It drives me crazy that I
had to do such a stupid thing!

00:04:19.753 --> 00:04:22.373
Just answer my questions straight.

00:04:22.373 --> 00:04:23.713
Was it Go Min Soo just now?

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:25.653
I don't know.

00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:27.913
- What? You don't know?
- I could've found out

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:31.173
who it was and what he was
going to do if we caught him, but

00:04:31.173 --> 00:04:34.033
we don't know anything,
thanks to you-know-who.

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:39.433
Of course, even if I knew, I had no intention
of sharing it with irresponsible police.

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:45.373
So please, let's not run
into each other again.

00:04:54.873 --> 00:04:56.493
You just...

00:04:57.693 --> 00:04:59.903
lost your way?

00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:05.243
Yeah, that's right. I can't
see very well at night.

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:06.863
I was scared for no reason.

00:05:06.863 --> 00:05:09.483
But you weren't scared
for no reason. Right?

00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:12.223
There was someone.

00:05:12.863 --> 00:05:15.283
He even ran away.

00:05:15.283 --> 00:05:19.213
Well, I didn't even know there was anyone.

00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:23.483
For someone who didn't know,
wasn't that a very specific reaction?

00:05:28.653 --> 00:05:30.403
Don't you remember?

00:05:30.403 --> 00:05:32.523
You yelled out earlier that it wasn't you.

00:05:32.523 --> 00:05:36.043
No, it's not! It's not me!

00:05:37.483 --> 00:05:39.043
What's not you?

00:05:39.043 --> 00:05:41.473
Has anyone questioned you about anything?

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:43.113
The one who escaped?

00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:46.143
Do you know who that was?

00:05:46.143 --> 00:05:49.643

I know it's hard to believe, but
I'm trying to help you right now.

00:05:59.453 --> 00:06:02.603
We can only prevent what's
to come if you tell me honestly.

00:06:02.603 --> 00:06:08.373
If you're being chased or threatened by someone,
you have to share everything, whatever it is.

00:06:17.093 --> 00:06:20.293

- Thank you...

Thank you for your concern, but...

00:06:25.823 --> 00:06:28.333
you have a misunderstanding.

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:31.013
I was not chased...

00:06:32.163 --> 00:06:34.773
or threatened by anyone ever.

breadsticks you like.

Why are you talking
about twisted bread sticks?

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:17.923
You can tell she's hiding something just by
looking at her. How can we send her away like that?

00:07:17.923 --> 00:07:23.523
On top of that, she doesn't seem to realize
what's going to happen to her in two days.

00:07:23.523 --> 00:07:26.523

nothing else will happen tonight.

know and what you don't know.

- on the 20th...
- One person disappeared.

00:11:37.033 --> 00:11:40.333
He left a note, so it was
treated as a runaway case.

But he actually died.

all don't know. But how do you...

["The People I Killed" by Go Mi Sook]

00:12:20.923 --> 00:12:22.883
It's a novel.

Written by Go Mi Sook.

00:12:27.943 --> 00:12:33.453
Ms. Go, can't you share a small spoiler
from the novel you're currently writing?

00:12:36.043 --> 00:12:38.083
Should I say it's a kind of confession?

00:12:38.083 --> 00:12:39.783
Confession?

00:12:40.813 --> 00:12:43.093
The main character...

00:12:43.093 --> 00:12:48.913
reveals everything about a perfect crime
that someone committed over 30 years ago.

00:12:48.913 --> 00:12:53.113
It was kind of a shame
to keep something like that

00:12:53.113 --> 00:12:56.313
- to himself all his life.
- Whoa...

00:12:57.283 --> 00:13:02.883
But if it was 30 years ago, it must have taken
place around the same time as this. [Small Door]

00:13:04.003 --> 00:13:06.783
This time, I really
wanted to tell my story.

00:13:08.953 --> 00:13:11.193
I'm joking. It's all made up.

00:13:11.193 --> 00:13:13.623
I wrote the truth all in there.

00:13:13.623 --> 00:13:17.603
Oh, of course. Gosh, Ms. Go...

00:13:21.403 --> 00:13:25.523
I was the editor in charge of Go
Mi Sook's works for a long time.

00:13:26.323 --> 00:13:28.213
Go Mi Sook?

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:38.423
That's why I had Go Mi Sook's new novel
that hasn't been released to the world yet.

00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:41.703
I had completely forgotten
about it since I came here.

00:13:41.703 --> 00:13:47.653
But ever since I saw the student
teacher, I felt a strange familiarity.

00:13:47.653 --> 00:13:52.653
So you opened it up again, and the
descriptions are the same as the novel?

00:13:53.923 --> 00:13:58.453
I never imagined she would write about
events that actually took place in real life.

00:13:58.453 --> 00:14:01.153
Anyway, that's what it said.

00:14:01.153 --> 00:14:06.023
Starting with that student
teacher, three women died, and

00:14:06.023 --> 00:14:09.683
the real culprit was never caught.

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.923
There's mention of a real criminal?

00:14:11.923 --> 00:14:16.403
Check the second page. Last
sentence of the last paragraph.

00:14:41.493 --> 00:14:44.973
"In the end, the truth was never revealed.

00:14:44.973 --> 00:14:47.333
The person who made
all these deaths happen...

00:14:47.333 --> 00:14:49.653
was me.

00:14:49.653 --> 00:14:53.693
Not even that delightful truth."

00:15:21.913 --> 00:15:24.643

00:15:27.903 --> 00:15:29.733

["The People I Killed" by Go Mi Sook]

00:15:56.053 --> 00:15:58.603
Do you really think Go Mi Sook did this?

00:16:03.178 --> 00:16:07.223
The culprit was never caught
in real life, either. Right?

00:16:07.223 --> 00:16:09.863
They did catch him.

00:16:09.863 --> 00:16:13.850
The culprit denied it until the
end, but we can't know the truth.

00:16:14.423 --> 00:16:18.783
Right. That's why she said that.

00:16:18.783 --> 00:16:21.173
She stole my mom's
work for her first novel.

00:16:21.173 --> 00:16:25.233
And this was really her story.

00:16:25.233 --> 00:16:30.063
Then, this could be
considered as new evidence.

00:16:30.063 --> 00:16:32.063
We can't make that conclusion.

00:16:32.063 --> 00:16:34.043
In any case, this is a novel.

00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:39.503
Even if it's based on true events,
you can add to it with more imagination.

00:16:39.503 --> 00:16:44.703
And here, when she says "I," there's
no guarantee she is talking about herself.

00:52:30.253 --> 00:52:32.673
So annoying!

00:52:32.673 --> 00:52:36.033
Which is the fastest bus to Seoul?

00:52:36.033 --> 00:52:37.623
It will be here in five minutes.

00:52:37.623 --> 00:52:39.793
- Please give me a token.
- Token?

00:52:39.793 --> 00:52:41.993
Wait a bit.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.033
- Hurry, please.
- Why is everyone sweating early in the day?

00:52:47.033 --> 00:52:48.793

00:52:50.553 --> 00:52:53.543
Shit. Just a moment!

Hey, catch her!

I don't know why you're doing this,
but you have to stay here tonight. Okay?

00:53:16.743 --> 00:53:19.163
That's how we can catch him.

00:53:19.953 --> 00:53:21.883
Probably so.

- It was you guys.
- Lee Joo Young.

You think I didn't know you were
watching me every night outside my motel?

00:53:41.423 --> 00:53:46.303
Even finding me below the bridge
that night wasn't a coincidence!

00:53:46.303 --> 00:53:49.603
You were planning to hand me
over to the police from the start!

00:53:49.603 --> 00:53:51.703
You have a misunderstanding.

00:53:51.703 --> 00:53:54.863
Please calm down and put down the knife.

00:53:54.863 --> 00:53:57.283
I can't trust anyone.

Please, believe me!

The police are on their way,
so please lower your voice.

00:54:24.073 --> 00:54:27.343
Isn't there anywhere we can hide?

00:54:27.343 --> 00:54:29.683
Oh, yes! In here!

00:54:29.683 --> 00:54:31.713

not hurt anywhere?

00:54:49.963 --> 00:54:51.993
I'm okay.

Is everything going to be okay?

00:54:53.993 --> 00:54:55.643
Yes.

00:54:59.223 --> 00:55:04.383
Well, the bus already left, and I
don't know who you're talking about.

00:55:04.383 --> 00:55:10.393
Yeah. We were here talking
about Miss Korea the whole time.

00:55:12.163 --> 00:55:14.663
Hello!

00:55:14.663 --> 00:55:18.003
I told you, you can't be Miss Korea!

Dad, I told you I'm Woojeong
Village's Kim Wan Sun.

00:55:27.203 --> 00:55:29.350
- Let's try the motel again.
- Yes.

00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:31.170
Yes, sir.

00:55:34.003 --> 00:55:37.703
Your dad peeled it for you, little wench!

00:55:37.703 --> 00:55:39.773
Geez!

00:55:47.223 --> 00:55:49.063
It's all because of me.

00:55:49.063 --> 00:55:52.623
An unexpected occurrence happened
because of my wrong judgment.

00:55:53.543 --> 00:55:58.873
In any case, it will be dangerous
to send her to the cafe tonight.

00:55:58.873 --> 00:56:03.393
Yes, let's take her somewhere safe for now.

00:56:11.143 --> 00:56:14.363
I thought I was alone...

00:56:16.333 --> 00:56:19.263
and I was so scared.

00:56:20.023 --> 00:56:22.243
I'm sorry.

00:56:22.243 --> 00:56:24.753
I'm sorry.

00:56:38.693 --> 00:56:41.003
Will you really be okay going alone?

00:56:41.003 --> 00:56:44.183
I'm only going to see
his face and come back.

The mysterious man in the

Baek Hee Seop, the one most
likely the culprit whose route matches.

01:00:07.933 --> 01:00:13.923
If the one with the blue cap really is the suspect,
it means he killed her mother and his wife.

- The blue cap is your-
- I know.
