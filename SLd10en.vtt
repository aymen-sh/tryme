00:12.320 --> 00:14.160
<i>Goto Ryuji's not fighting.</i>

00:14.160 --> 00:18.370
<i>Still, it's thanks to him that I get 
to watch S-Rank hunters do battle.</i>

00:18.770 --> 00:19.870
Well...

00:24.050 --> 00:26.010
Let's get started!

02:05.770 --> 02:07.270
A test of strength, huh?

02:07.740 --> 02:09.730
I appreciate the simplicity!

02:09.730 --> 02:13.460
But which of us is stronger?!

02:21.660 --> 02:24.120
<i>So fast! I'm at a disadvantage 
in close-quarters combat!</i>

02:28.110 --> 02:31.380
My specialty is ranged attacks!

02:33.880 --> 02:35.920
Hoshino! Watch it!

02:35.920 --> 02:37.740
Hurry and take him down already!

02:42.690 --> 02:47.950
Chairman, this building's been reinforced with
the highest quality of essence stone, yes?

02:47.950 --> 02:49.100
It has.

02:49.100 --> 02:52.900
That said, we might need to reevaluate 
how durable it actually is.

02:53.860 --> 02:57.780
<i>These guys are the cream of the crop 
among S-Rank hunters.</i>

02:57.780 --> 03:02.410
<i>I need to move like they're trying to snap 
my wrists, not just grab them!</i>

03:06.070 --> 03:07.920
<i>I think this one's name was Kumamoto Atsushi.</i>

03:08.300 --> 03:11.250
<i>He doesn't seem very aggressive.</i>

03:12.880 --> 03:16.340
<i>Damn it. I'm not cut out for this at all.</i>

03:16.340 --> 03:18.590
<i>I guess I just don't have the heart for it.</i>

03:21.060 --> 03:25.500
<i>The idea might be to use us to test him.</i>

03:25.920 --> 03:28.270
<i>To make sure he's prepared to fight the ants.</i>

03:32.690 --> 03:35.190
<i>So I'm supposed to be a test, huh...</i>

03:35.510 --> 03:37.660
<i>Time to see if you pass or fail!</i>

03:37.660 --> 03:39.680
<i>Oh, crap! I just can't!</i>

03:43.940 --> 03:46.080
Whatta buncha maniacs.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.150
My little A-Ranked self 
wouldn't stand a chance.

03:49.150 --> 03:50.890
That's just not true!

03:50.890 --> 03:53.150
You're plenty strong yourself, Master!

03:55.710 --> 03:58.190
I guess I won the test of strength.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.260
You drove me into the ground!

04:01.780 --> 04:03.600
That's honestly a first.

04:05.350 --> 04:07.310
Looks like I win.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.240
Are you just going to keep runn—

04:15.360 --> 04:18.070
Do I seem weaker than Hunter Cha?

04:18.360 --> 04:20.200
That's kind of insulting...

04:21.740 --> 04:23.120
<i>I can't predict her next move!</i>

04:23.600 --> 04:25.450
<i>The Dancer, Cha Hae-in...</i>

04:25.940 --> 04:30.830
<i>Seeing her fight in person really 
drives home how accurate the name is!</i>

04:34.100 --> 04:35.300
Tag.

04:35.770 --> 04:37.890
<i>I had better help Hunter Baek.</i>

04:44.510 --> 04:45.970
What was <i>that</i>?!

04:45.970 --> 04:48.980
<i>Oh, no, I lashed out on reflex!</i>

04:53.870 --> 04:56.190
Aw, hell, he's snapped.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.900
There's no telling what he'll do now.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.790
Should we stop him?

05:02.200 --> 05:04.240
Only if it looks like 
someone's gonna get injured.

05:08.870 --> 05:09.790
<i>So fast!</i>

05:13.920 --> 05:15.340
That looks bad!

05:21.740 --> 05:24.220
Maybe it's none of my business,

05:24.640 --> 05:27.680
but this doesn't feel like 
friendly sparring anymore.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.140
Who the hell are you?!

05:32.600 --> 05:36.110
No way... He was able to just brush off 
Kumamoto, even in his berserk state!

05:36.390 --> 05:39.430
And this is the hunter that's 
supposed to be a mage type?

05:39.430 --> 05:41.320
That's what I heard, yes.

05:41.630 --> 05:44.030
<i>Guess I'll have to find out for myself.</i>

05:44.420 --> 05:47.870
Hunter Cha, you're willing 
to accept the loss, yes?

05:48.540 --> 05:51.100
Considering Hunter Baek seems 
to have already dropped out.

05:51.100 --> 05:51.830
Right.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.290
<i>Even if I'd gone all out, it wouldn't have 
been enough to turn things around.</i>

05:59.370 --> 06:00.880
Hunter Sung.

06:01.200 --> 06:05.590
Guildmaster Goto is asking 
if you'd like to spar with him.

06:05.590 --> 06:08.330
<i>His body is radiating fighting spirit...</i>

06:08.330 --> 06:10.960
<i>He probably wants to see what I've got.</i>

06:12.230 --> 06:15.690
<i>This'll be a good chance to test the power 
I gained from the Demon's Castle.</i>

06:16.830 --> 06:18.840
<i>Did he just smile? 
At the thought of facing me?</i>

06:19.680 --> 06:23.190
Hunter Sung has accepted your challenge, sir.

06:23.190 --> 06:25.480
But he has a stipulation.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.760
What's that?

06:26.760 --> 06:29.660
He'll agree to spar on the condition 
that you hold nothing back.

06:32.550 --> 06:33.890
Interesting.

06:34.540 --> 06:38.250
<i>The fourth Jeju Island raid is approaching.</i>

06:38.250 --> 06:41.230
<i>After the formation of an alliance with Japan,</i>

06:41.230 --> 06:43.840
<i>preparations are now underway 
to ensure a successful outcome.</i>

06:42.740 --> 06:45.030
Do you got work today?

06:45.030 --> 06:47.310
I'm off. I told ya yesterday.

06:47.310 --> 06:48.750
You did?

06:48.750 --> 06:53.930
Well, the hunters are workin' hard, 
so we better do our best, too.

07:03.620 --> 07:06.110
Hello. Well...

07:06.980 --> 07:10.430
I had some questions about 
the Jeju raid's defensive forces.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.040
What's going on now?

07:13.040 --> 07:18.750
So this is the famous tenth S-Rank. 
He's a feisty one to wanna take on Goto!

07:18.750 --> 07:24.680
<i>I saw him fight in an A-Rank dungeon before, 
but will he be okay against an S-Rank hunter?</i>

07:24.680 --> 07:28.210
You don't seem to mind being 
around other hunters today.

07:28.790 --> 07:32.080
It's not like I can be constantly 
covering my nose on the battlefield.

07:32.990 --> 07:35.350
Should we stop them?

07:35.350 --> 07:38.940
It's a melee hunter going up against 
a spellcaster in close combat...

07:39.310 --> 07:41.590
Normally, I would.

07:41.590 --> 07:44.820
But I'm thinking the same thing 
you are, Hunter Cha.

07:46.220 --> 07:48.570
Can't help but get your hopes up, right?

07:48.830 --> 07:50.720
<i>If my suspicion is right,</i>

07:50.720 --> 07:54.040
<i>and Hunter Sung is an awakened with 
the power to continue growing stronger...</i>

07:56.470 --> 07:57.540
Well, let's—

08:02.230 --> 08:04.130
Come on, man, I wasn't finished.

08:04.130 --> 08:06.340
<i>His speed and agility...</i>

08:06.340 --> 08:09.800
<i>And he's a mage type? What a joke.</i>

08:12.350 --> 08:14.720
<i>Let's see who you really are!</i>

08:16.140 --> 08:19.800
<i>He's definitely a step above 
the other S-Ranks.</i>

08:19.800 --> 08:22.860
<i>But he's not so fast that I can't dodge him.</i>

08:22.860 --> 08:24.780
<i>Smiling again...?</i>

08:24.780 --> 08:27.190
The attacks are so fast, 
I can't even follow them.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.400
He's doing a great job evading.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.870
And that's a real accomplishment 
with attacks like that.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.330
<i>He's not just dodging, either.</i>

08:35.880 --> 08:37.830
<i>He's testing his opponent's strength.</i>

08:42.540 --> 08:45.380
<i>The idea of him running circles around me 
is getting on my nerves.</i>

08:45.380 --> 08:46.790
<i>Change of plans.</i>

08:47.030 --> 08:48.650
<i>I'll crush him for real!</i>

08:55.720 --> 08:57.190
<i>Hunter Sung!</i>

09:02.310 --> 09:05.520
Careful, now. Someone could've lost an eye.

09:05.520 --> 09:08.230
<i>He grabbed my hand instead of my wrist.</i>

09:08.230 --> 09:10.110
Are you toying with me?

09:10.110 --> 09:12.700
I'm not sure what you're saying, but...

09:13.380 --> 09:15.740
If I had grabbed your wrist, 
the game would've been over.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.080
And I doubt either of us 
want it to end that easily.

09:30.550 --> 09:32.400
Whoa, Goto's getting serious!

09:32.400 --> 09:35.550
If they keep going, both of them 
could end up seriously injured!

09:44.400 --> 09:45.650
<i>Ice?</i>

09:46.420 --> 09:47.690
Hunter Sung!

09:47.970 --> 09:48.900
Goto!

09:48.900 --> 09:53.320
Let's call it off. If this keeps up, 
it's going to get out of control!

09:53.750 --> 09:56.030
Tell him to stop sparring!

09:56.030 --> 09:57.490
R-Right!

10:00.030 --> 10:01.920
Did I spoil your fun?

10:01.920 --> 10:02.840
Not at all.

10:03.830 --> 10:08.340
You fought the mighty Goto, and it only 
cost you a scratch! You're pretty good.

10:11.120 --> 10:14.680
<i>I got a little hot under the collar. But...</i>

10:15.340 --> 10:18.680
<i>Now I've got a good grasp 
on the skills of everyone here.</i>

10:18.680 --> 10:21.900
<i>I was able to send soldiers 
into five of their shadows, too.</i>

10:23.890 --> 10:28.340
I'll be sending the information on the 
hunters involved in the raid later.

10:28.340 --> 10:31.700
If you could forward them to our 
vice guild master too, please.

10:31.700 --> 10:32.860
Of course.

10:37.760 --> 10:38.890
Chairman Go.

10:40.180 --> 10:42.750
What is it, Hunter Sung?

10:43.170 --> 10:45.250
About the Jeju Island raid...

10:48.170 --> 10:52.170
<i>Reiji. One of the hunters 
over here is pretty good.</i>

10:53.380 --> 10:56.390
I doubt he's a real match for the 
Drawn Sword's guild master, though.

10:56.390 --> 10:57.820
<i>Don't be too sure about that.</i>

10:57.820 --> 10:59.410
Which one is it?

10:59.410 --> 11:03.680
<i>Sung Jinwoo. He's a reawakened 
who recently became S-Rank.</i>

11:04.710 --> 11:06.320
That's strange.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.920
I don't see his name on 
the roster for the raid.

11:09.920 --> 11:10.770
What?

11:12.730 --> 11:16.410
Hunter Sung isn't accompanying us 
on the raid, I see.

11:16.410 --> 11:19.280
I'm sure he's got his reasons.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.410
That said...

11:20.670 --> 11:23.370
<i>Byung-gu's name isn't here, either.</i>

11:23.630 --> 11:24.710
<i>Still...</i>

11:24.710 --> 11:28.920
We've already got 15 S-Rank hunters.

11:29.260 --> 11:31.130
I'm sure that this time...

11:35.750 --> 11:37.640
We're going to win!

11:40.600 --> 11:41.480
I'm home.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.680
You're late, Jinwoo!

11:44.840 --> 11:46.640
Welcome home, Jinwoo.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.650
Dinner's ready.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.180
Good to be back.

11:52.670 --> 11:57.080
<i>Mom just woke up from a four-year coma. 
She needs my help.</i>

11:57.870 --> 11:59.280
<i>Which is why...</i>

11:59.900 --> 12:01.740
<i>I'm not going to Jeju Island.</i>

12:05.700 --> 12:09.670
<i>With the lack of new prey, 
they've begun to cannibalize each other.</i>

12:10.550 --> 12:14.950
<i>There is not enough food here 
for my subjects to feast on.</i>

12:15.830 --> 12:17.550
<i>This won't do.</i>

12:17.930 --> 12:19.950
<i>We must leave this island.</i>

12:21.010 --> 12:23.340
<i>I need stronger offspring...</i>

12:23.340 --> 12:28.760
<i>A child more powerful than any other, 
capable of leading our kingdom.</i>

13:04.260 --> 13:07.220
Grow strong, my son.

13:14.630 --> 13:17.780
<i>The ant magic beasts have been 
evolving at a disturbing rate.</i>

13:18.180 --> 13:21.660
<i>Though they crawled along the ground 
during the third Jeju Island raid,</i>

13:22.040 --> 13:25.160
<i>as you can see in this 
recently captured footage,</i>

13:25.160 --> 13:26.960
<i>they've taken a more humanoid appearance</i>

13:26.960 --> 13:29.620
<i>in addition to growing 
large wings on their backs.</i>

13:30.050 --> 13:31.980
<i>The Hunter's Association has begun formulating</i>

13:31.980 --> 13:34.660
<i>a strategy for dealing with 
these latest beasts in response.</i>

13:38.380 --> 13:39.740
There you are, magic beast!

13:39.740 --> 13:41.890
Now you have to face an S-Rank hunter!

13:45.300 --> 13:47.470
This is a bad idea! It's way too dangerous.

13:47.780 --> 13:51.230
Why shouldn't I join the defense force?

13:51.230 --> 13:54.020
Well, Ms. Han, you're an E-Rank, for one...

13:54.690 --> 13:57.190
So that's how it's gonna be?!

13:55.780 --> 13:58.810
Ow, ow, ow! Sorry!

13:58.810 --> 14:02.790
<i>As a countermeasure against even a single ant 
making it to the mainland,</i>

14:02.790 --> 14:07.460
<i>hunters are being enlisted to defensive duty.</i>

14:12.300 --> 14:14.250
<i>Tomorrow's the day...</i>

14:14.680 --> 14:16.990
<i>of the Jeju Island raid.</i>

14:20.730 --> 14:22.290
<i>This is the first fleet.</i>

14:22.290 --> 14:24.970
<i>We've arrived at our destination 
in the vicinity of Jeju Island.</i>

14:25.370 --> 14:27.930
<i>Second fleet reporting. We have arrived.</i>

14:28.420 --> 14:31.820
<i>This is the third fleet. 
We're approaching the perimeter.</i>

14:31.820 --> 14:36.640
<i>Fourth fleet here. We're en route. 
We anticipate arrival in five minutes.</i>

14:37.650 --> 14:41.550
Master, do you think we're 
strong enough to fight the ants?

14:41.550 --> 14:44.410
No way to know until ya try.

14:44.410 --> 14:48.300
But we've been sent out here 
in case of an emergency.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.660
Gotta keep those creepy-crawlies 
from reachin' the mainland.

14:50.660 --> 14:52.260
You're amazing, Master!

14:52.260 --> 14:55.580
I'll follow you for the rest of my life!

14:57.750 --> 15:00.340
Take care of things for me.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.970
I doubt it'll come to that.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.910
Probably gonna spend the day spacing out...

15:04.910 --> 15:07.050
You can never be sure!

15:07.050 --> 15:10.160
Besides, having my vice 
guild master at the ready

15:10.160 --> 15:12.760
means I can rest easy 
when I head into battle.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.460
Just be careful, sir.

15:16.460 --> 15:17.180
Will do.

15:18.150 --> 15:21.300
Why in the hell is Minsung 
positioned all the way up here?!

15:21.300 --> 15:23.440
It's gonna be bad news if things pop off!

15:23.440 --> 15:25.410
Send him further back!

15:42.870 --> 15:45.260
The teams have all made contact.

15:45.260 --> 15:49.430
Both the mainland coastal guard 
and Jeju Island hunters are ready.

15:49.860 --> 15:53.130
The diversionary force has successfully 
landed on the island.

15:55.350 --> 16:00.690
A large number of hunters 
heard the call of duty this time.

16:01.380 --> 16:05.860
<i>And it's a relief that </i>he<i> 
decided to join, as well.</i>

16:12.830 --> 16:13.980
Byung-gu!

16:14.800 --> 16:17.040
I didn't think you'd come.

16:17.040 --> 16:21.500
I realized you'd probably be dead in seconds 
without a healer watching your back.

16:21.940 --> 16:25.090
You charge straight in when 
you see magic beasts, y'know?

16:25.090 --> 16:28.750
Only because if I didn't, 
they'd probably kill you!

16:34.930 --> 16:37.390
This is the city 
at the center of the island.

16:37.390 --> 16:40.100
Alpha here. All hunters, sound off.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.400
Bravo here, in position.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.690
Charlie, in position.

16:44.690 --> 16:47.240
Delta, ready for action.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.750
A live broadcast?

16:50.750 --> 16:54.910
Right. Well, with a ten-minute delay 
in case of any accidents.

16:54.910 --> 16:57.450
As a cameraman for the hunter 
communications department,

16:57.450 --> 17:00.450
I'll make sure to document 
this battle for the people!

17:01.250 --> 17:05.600
A hunter can really go all-out when 
they've got something to protect!

17:05.600 --> 17:08.560
That said, this is going to be pretty intense.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.590
Are you gonna be okay?

17:09.590 --> 17:13.220
Don't worry. Funnily enough, I'm an A-Rank.

17:13.220 --> 17:15.100
I'm used to filming in hazardous conditions.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.150
Good to know.

17:17.670 --> 17:22.980
This might be the last chance the public 
ever gets to watch an S-Rank raid.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.690
Hell, it had better be.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.900
Because this time, 
we're going to finish it for good!

17:29.290 --> 17:33.870
<i>If we don't pull this off, our whole country 
could be wiped off the map.</i>

17:33.870 --> 17:37.450
<i>We need a hero.</i>

17:38.240 --> 17:42.160
The strike team is prepared to mobilize.

17:42.590 --> 17:47.750
Then let the fourth Jeju Island raid commence!

17:47.750 --> 17:49.460
All hunters, release your full strength!

17:49.460 --> 17:50.760
Roger!

17:51.420 --> 17:54.500
The diversionary force is making their move.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.430
What incredible magic power.

17:56.430 --> 17:58.520
And there go the ants.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.110
Whoa, we've got some headed our way, too!

18:02.110 --> 18:03.940
Please open the hatch.

18:03.940 --> 18:05.870
I'll handle it.

18:15.450 --> 18:16.570
Incredible...

18:17.140 --> 18:18.950
There <i>are</i> quite a few of them.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.600
I'm afraid I'll have to get a bit more rough.

18:30.140 --> 18:34.050
<i>After all this time, I'm finally back.</i>

18:34.480 --> 18:35.760
<i>Back on this island.</i>

18:38.640 --> 18:41.430
That's the ultimate weapon for you! 
Glad he's here.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.850
Well, everyone, let's touch down.

18:47.310 --> 18:52.150
The Japanese hunters should be able 
to distract the ants for about an hour.

18:52.480 --> 18:56.900
Which means that's our deadline 
for taking down the queen.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.190
Everybody ready?

18:59.660 --> 19:01.680
We can do this!

19:02.750 --> 19:03.910
Let's go!

19:06.290 --> 19:10.490
We're ready to get started, too. 
Start up the interference signal.

19:10.490 --> 19:12.260
Initiating signal interference.

19:14.470 --> 19:19.180
<i>Now the ants won't be able to detect 
the queen's distress signal.</i>

19:21.560 --> 19:24.270
Kumamoto! If you keep flinching, 
you're gonna die!

19:27.550 --> 19:30.090
Wouldn't it be faster for us 
to just kill all the ants

19:30.090 --> 19:33.570
instead of waiting for the others 
to get the queen?

19:33.570 --> 19:35.750
Possibly. Where's Kenzo?

19:36.390 --> 19:39.320
Goofing around over there. He's like a kid.

19:39.670 --> 19:41.350
Did you see that flame?

19:41.350 --> 19:43.660
It's gotta be that Choi guy, right?

19:43.660 --> 19:47.330
If he and I fought, 
do you think I could take him?

19:47.330 --> 19:49.830
I run hot and cold on the subject.

19:51.790 --> 19:56.190
The nest is contained. We should keep 
moving while the distraction is effective.

19:56.190 --> 19:58.760
This sure is a lot of tunnels, though.

19:58.760 --> 20:02.590
How are we supposed to find 
the one that leads to the queen?

20:10.740 --> 20:12.990
What the hell was that?! Be careful!

20:12.990 --> 20:16.650
We don't have the time to search them all.

20:17.260 --> 20:20.870
We just need to find the one that leads 
the deepest underground, right?

20:21.280 --> 20:23.270
I believe it's that one.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.840
That's today's daily quest done.

20:32.300 --> 20:35.000
No one around today, either.

20:36.970 --> 20:41.240
<i>All of the S-Rank hunters 
on this raid are strong.</i>

20:41.700 --> 20:44.090
<i>They should be able to handle it easily.</i>

20:44.850 --> 20:46.460
<i>Even without me.</i>

20:49.850 --> 20:52.710
And the queen is really down here?

20:52.710 --> 20:54.860
Maybe she abandoned them to run.

20:54.860 --> 20:57.570
It's an island. 
There's nowhere for her to go.

20:57.570 --> 21:00.030
Everyone, take a look at this.

21:03.420 --> 21:05.140
It's an egg chamber!

21:05.140 --> 21:07.660
The queen's room should be nearby.

21:08.940 --> 21:10.160
Look there!

21:11.050 --> 21:12.330
That egg...

21:12.690 --> 21:15.730
No way... That's an ant egg?

21:15.730 --> 21:17.470
At that size?!

21:17.870 --> 21:22.470
We're here for the queen. Focus on that.

21:23.090 --> 21:25.960
<i>I can't blame him for being shaken, though.</i>

21:25.960 --> 21:28.060
<i>They seem to have limitless 
potential for evolution.</i>

21:28.590 --> 21:33.310
<i>And if there's an ant out there that 
was born from an egg of that size...</i>

21:34.590 --> 21:35.520
Shit...

21:35.910 --> 21:38.990
These bugs are tough. 
One of them got my shoulder.

21:38.990 --> 21:42.590
Want me to heal you? 
Assuming you can afford it!

21:42.590 --> 21:45.740
Quit screwing around, Shimizu. Just do it.

21:45.740 --> 21:47.610
But there's something I want.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.750
And it's not money this time.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.740
More incoming...

21:53.110 --> 21:56.250
Fine. What do you—
