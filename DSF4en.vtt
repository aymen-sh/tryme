00:17.660 --> 00:22.320
You mean to say there's another scientist 
like you on the other side of the world,

00:22.320 --> 00:24.650
and they revived on their own, too?

00:26.360 --> 00:29.950
It's not as though I have a monopoly on science.

00:29.950 --> 00:33.440
The whole world's been sharing the knowledge.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.890
Anyone who's interested can read up.

00:35.890 --> 00:39.870
So someone started from 
a stone axe like you did

00:39.870 --> 00:42.640
and made it all the way to a machine gun?

00:42.960 --> 00:46.400
I don't think just being 
<i>interested</i> can get you that far!

00:46.650 --> 00:50.800
Although, until we make contact, 
we're just guessing.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.780
What we know currently

00:52.780 --> 00:55.910
is that there's a scientist who appears 
to have revived on their own.

00:56.410 --> 00:57.530
That, and...

00:57.790 --> 01:02.800
...that their science is just a teeny 
bit more advanced than ours.

01:05.980 --> 01:09.040
At least, when it comes to military equipment.

01:10.850 --> 01:15.380
And most importantly, they're ready to off us.

01:23.310 --> 01:24.420
Engine noise!

01:24.940 --> 01:25.850
From behind us!

01:26.340 --> 01:27.330
Are they after us?

01:27.330 --> 01:30.610
No. I've been keeping a close eye out,

01:30.930 --> 01:33.500
but I don't see anything
that looks like a boat.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.700
We traveled this fast on this thing all night.

01:36.700 --> 01:39.820
I doubt they could catch up to us that easily.

01:43.090 --> 01:44.030
No...

01:44.600 --> 01:45.790
This sound is...

01:50.650 --> 01:53.920
You've got to be kidding me!

04:02.670 --> 04:03.970
Senku!

04:03.970 --> 04:05.020
Senku!

04:05.660 --> 04:06.770
Senku!

04:08.860 --> 04:09.960
What now?

04:09.960 --> 04:11.710
Wanna try waving hi?

04:11.710 --> 04:14.820
I'm pretty sure we should 
be waving a white flag!

04:14.820 --> 04:17.690
Maybe there's a chance we can 
talk it over like friends.

04:18.350 --> 04:21.280
With someone who opened fire 
the instant they saw us?

04:23.830 --> 04:25.030
I hate to say it,

04:25.030 --> 04:27.830
but they wouldn't be flying so low 
if they didn't intend to attack us!

04:29.480 --> 04:31.620
I'm flooring it! Hang on, everyone!

04:31.960 --> 04:33.790
Full speed ahead!

05:10.780 --> 05:11.780
Incoming!

05:37.690 --> 05:39.560
Ow!

05:39.850 --> 05:42.680
It hurts!

05:41.360 --> 05:43.970
it's just a scrape. I'll be fine.

05:43.970 --> 05:45.170
Matsukaze!

05:45.170 --> 05:48.230
Matsukaze got hurt protecting me!

05:47.290 --> 05:50.000
Relax! It's not a serious injury.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.370
Besides, you aren't even the one hurting.

05:54.790 --> 05:56.660
Fall! Fall!

05:56.660 --> 05:57.930
You're wasting ammo.

05:57.930 --> 05:59.660
Do you really expect to hit it?

05:59.660 --> 06:02.160
But there's no other option!

06:02.160 --> 06:04.340
We have nowhere to run!

06:16.460 --> 06:17.680
It flew in front of the sun!

06:17.680 --> 06:21.520
They're dead-set on shooting us dead!

06:36.340 --> 06:40.170
You never know when something 
might come in handy, eh?

06:40.720 --> 06:42.070
What's that flask for?

06:42.070 --> 06:43.540
Hell if I know.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.250
We can ask him later.

06:46.420 --> 06:48.090
Kirisame!

06:52.430 --> 06:55.200
We're counting on your throw!

06:55.200 --> 06:56.670
What do you need to make it happen?

06:56.670 --> 06:59.490
Stable footing and a rope!

07:04.940 --> 07:06.280
It's coming again!

07:38.720 --> 07:40.190
Wow.

07:40.190 --> 07:43.600
You got my engine knocking in one shot.

07:49.550 --> 07:50.790
I'm impressed.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.170
We did it!

08:02.500 --> 08:04.170
Yeah!

08:06.050 --> 08:07.560
How, though?

08:15.960 --> 08:18.090
<i>That would be acetylene gas.</i>

08:18.510 --> 08:23.370
<i>Harmless to the human body, but can stall 
an engine at just 1% concentration.</i>

08:23.370 --> 08:26.950
<i>Such an elegant countermeasure.</i>

08:28.670 --> 08:32.560
Ah, a pyro-whatsit weapon.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.740
I might have learned about that.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.450
<i>Pyrophoric.</i>

08:37.290 --> 08:38.760
I wouldn't remember that.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.450
Not after thousands of years of being a statue.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.930
<i>It can be made easily by mixing 
water and calcium carbide.</i>

08:45.930 --> 08:49.740
<i>Calcium carbide can be made by 
cooking coal and sea shells...</i>

08:48.550 --> 08:50.340
Okay, got it.

08:50.340 --> 08:51.890
You can stop there.

08:58.730 --> 09:00.640
The enemy's got one.

09:01.540 --> 09:04.200
One of those clever science guys.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.010
One just like you.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.110
They might come back with more men!

09:15.110 --> 09:16.860
We should run away!

09:16.860 --> 09:17.660
Hurry!

09:18.060 --> 09:19.290
Run?

09:19.290 --> 09:22.540
Like hell we will. We're doing the opposite.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.790
There's something lewd about your eyes!

09:25.720 --> 09:29.300
Those two are giving off that vibe again.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.620
They're definitely thinking 
up something naughty.

09:33.380 --> 09:36.960
You saw where that plane crashed, didn't you?

09:37.520 --> 09:42.230
We're headed there before they call for backup.

09:57.210 --> 09:58.990
There's no one inside.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.070
They must have fled already.

10:01.590 --> 10:05.540
We could have intimidated them 
into giving us information.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.880
Well, that drop is ours, then.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.730
Yup. Finders keepers.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.880
Ah... So that's what you were getting at.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.310
m 0 0 l 144 0 l 144 80 l 0 80

10:20.300 --> 10:23.310
(Damaged)
Airplane
acquired!!

10:23.310 --> 10:28.290
The righteous Kingdom of Science is more 
than happy to take it off your hands!

10:29.410 --> 10:31.930
We take enemy resources for ourselves!

10:31.930 --> 10:33.320
Such fine tactics!

10:33.320 --> 10:35.350
Your eyes aren't making it very compelling!

10:35.350 --> 10:37.610
You just wanted that plane, didn't you?!

10:38.920 --> 10:43.280
I mean, Senku-chan's face when 
he saw that plane earlier...

10:43.610 --> 10:45.460
I could hear his heart screaming.

10:45.460 --> 10:47.640
He was saying it with his eyes.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.580
"This is exhilarating," he said.

10:51.890 --> 10:53.040
Yup.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.950
I sure was.

11:02.950 --> 11:03.890
Senku.

11:04.350 --> 11:10.100
I found something rather fascinating on 
this so-called "airplane" that we took.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.750
This is fantastic!

11:15.500 --> 11:17.570
Those would be corn kernels and leaves.

11:17.930 --> 11:19.010
That's right...

11:19.440 --> 11:22.080
The enemy sent a plane after us.

11:22.410 --> 11:27.200
That means there has to be a relatively level, 
open field nearby that would serve as a runway.

11:28.050 --> 11:31.480
I see! A cornfield runway!

11:31.480 --> 11:36.340
In theory, we should retreat 
after an ambush.

11:37.110 --> 11:41.680
But there's just too much to gain in pursuing 
them, even if it means taking a risk.

11:42.030 --> 11:44.640
Pursue? Who?

11:44.640 --> 11:46.350
Isn't it obvious?

11:46.350 --> 11:49.430
We're tracking down the enemy pilot.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.920
If we can find ourselves a cornfield,

11:51.920 --> 11:55.610
we can skip over years of prepping 
the land and growing crops.

11:56.070 --> 11:58.360
Don't forget why we're here.

11:58.640 --> 12:02.730
We came all this way to find corn.

12:03.310 --> 12:07.890
No, I mean, <i>who's</i> pursuing them?

12:13.640 --> 12:16.440
Between me the explorer, Gen the mentalist,

12:17.650 --> 12:21.550
and the eyes and bodyguard Kohaku, 
we make an unstoppable pursuit trio!

12:21.550 --> 12:24.530
And we'd be found by the enemy 
if there were too many of us.

12:24.530 --> 12:26.580
Yeah... I knew it.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.850
I knew, but I asked anyway.

12:35.540 --> 12:37.680
Is this really the right way?

12:38.020 --> 12:40.410
There's no doubt, Chrome-chan.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.420
Look here.

12:43.420 --> 12:45.480
The enemy's footprints?!

12:45.480 --> 12:47.690
Damn, Gen, you're good!

13:03.230 --> 13:04.670
Man...

13:05.040 --> 13:08.560
Do you really need a mentalist?

13:08.560 --> 13:11.060
This pursuit is too easy.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.020
Hang on, this isn't right.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.900
I think he's luring us in.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.740
The enemy's a pro.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.020
What an asshole.

13:27.020 --> 13:30.910
Do you really want to play 
that game against a mentalist?

13:31.700 --> 13:36.580
The poker game was super legit.

13:37.460 --> 13:41.080
That's one thing I'm still bummed about.

13:41.550 --> 13:42.940
Just a little.

13:44.440 --> 13:49.090
I gotta redeem myself, you see.

13:50.280 --> 13:54.620
Don't go even one step ahead of me, 
Chrome-chan, Kohaku-chan.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.890
Follow me, both of you.

13:59.540 --> 14:02.730
I'll make a trail of flowers for you.

14:03.660 --> 14:05.620
O-Okay.

14:46.670 --> 14:49.570
H-Hello.

14:49.570 --> 14:51.990
Is anyone there?

15:06.020 --> 15:07.270
Who are you?!

15:07.270 --> 15:08.470
Where did you come from?

15:08.470 --> 15:11.000
I didn't notice you at all!

15:11.980 --> 15:14.510
Yikes! No guns! Please!

15:16.960 --> 15:18.430
Is this a pat-down?

15:18.430 --> 15:21.610
I don't have any weapons on me!

15:21.610 --> 15:24.860
You're right, no weapons.

15:29.520 --> 15:33.030
But you've got all kinds of tricks on you.

15:33.030 --> 15:34.910
Who are you?

15:40.080 --> 15:41.300
A magician?

15:41.300 --> 15:43.540
Something like that.

15:43.540 --> 15:46.220
Uh-huh, I can tell from your body.

15:46.220 --> 15:48.650
Only your fingers are well-built.

15:49.070 --> 15:52.050
At the very least, you aren't a combatant.

15:52.580 --> 15:56.490
Unlike your master samurai buddies.

15:58.850 --> 16:02.060
I was hoping to end them 
with a pre-emptive strike.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.320
Anyway, I have a lot of questions for you.

16:08.110 --> 16:09.690
You do, too, don't you?

16:09.930 --> 16:13.360
Come meet my leader doctor.

16:43.980 --> 16:45.020
We're here.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.510
<i>So this is the enemy base.</i>

17:18.090 --> 17:19.640
<i>Here it is.</i>

17:20.340 --> 17:24.340
<i>We found that cornfield, Senku-chan!</i>

17:28.560 --> 17:30.190
<i>Tractors?!</i>

17:34.550 --> 17:35.760
<i>Cows!</i>

17:36.070 --> 17:38.820
<i>So they've even started dairy farming.</i>

17:43.130 --> 17:47.280
<i>And there's that runway.</i>

17:47.280 --> 17:52.300
<i>There has to be more than just that one plane.</i>

17:53.070 --> 17:55.970
<i>But he'd never show me, would he?</i>

18:00.040 --> 18:02.860
H-Holy...

18:02.860 --> 18:04.340
Not there.

18:17.300 --> 18:20.120
<i>What is this? A factory?</i>

18:25.940 --> 18:27.980
Yo, Xeno.

18:27.980 --> 18:29.570
I knew I'd find you here.

18:29.570 --> 18:31.020
Good news.

18:31.020 --> 18:34.300
The New World has its first guest.

18:37.710 --> 18:40.080
<i>Just like Senku-chan.</i>

18:41.000 --> 18:42.660
<i>No, not at all.</i>

18:42.660 --> 18:44.480
<i>He's a grown-up.</i>

18:46.880 --> 18:49.490
<i>He's seriously a professional...</i>

18:51.350 --> 18:53.020
<i>scientist.</i>

18:59.090 --> 19:00.170
What is this?!

19:00.170 --> 19:01.860
Some mystery chemicals?!

19:01.860 --> 19:02.960
Quit freaking out.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.450
It's just salt water.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.140
Nice to meet you.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.800
I don't believe I've introduced myself.

19:21.640 --> 19:26.580
That man there, who has the peculiar 
habit of inhaling poison gas, is...

19:26.580 --> 19:28.010
Shut it.

19:28.010 --> 19:30.310
It's tobacco.

19:30.310 --> 19:32.360
Stanley Snider.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.920
Former soldier.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.230
Actually, current soldier.

19:36.510 --> 19:38.070
Working for us.

19:39.980 --> 19:41.780
I'm Doctor Xeno.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.530
Who might you be?

19:43.530 --> 19:44.860
Where did you come from?

19:44.860 --> 19:46.890
<i>Back off! Back off!</i>

19:46.890 --> 19:48.950
<i>Why touch my neck?</i>

19:49.320 --> 19:51.300
My name is Asagiri Gen.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.010
I used to be something of a magician in Japan.

19:54.010 --> 19:55.040
Japan?

19:55.480 --> 19:57.610
Hear that, Stanley?

19:57.610 --> 19:59.560
How magnificent.

19:59.560 --> 20:05.330
These gentlemen made the easterly 
Columbus voyage in this stone world.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.310
<i>Is this what I think it is?</i>

20:14.240 --> 20:15.490
<i>Breath...</i>

20:15.840 --> 20:17.180
<i>Perspiration...</i>

20:17.180 --> 20:18.940
<i>An EKG reading...</i>

20:19.770 --> 20:21.560
<i>Polygraph test?</i>

20:21.560 --> 20:24.200
<i>Is this a lie detector of some sort?</i>

20:29.100 --> 20:33.550
<i>Do you really want to play 
that game against a mentalist?</i>

20:37.980 --> 20:40.260
The Kingdom of Science...

20:40.260 --> 20:42.370
They work us like hell!

20:42.370 --> 20:45.960
The leader is especially brutal!

20:45.960 --> 20:48.570
So I ran away!

20:51.560 --> 20:53.760
Surprisingly unflinching.

20:54.140 --> 20:57.000
He speaks elegantly and smoothly.

20:57.450 --> 21:00.370
So it's all true? What a guy.

21:01.110 --> 21:02.190
No.

21:02.820 --> 21:08.210
He's either incredibly honest 
or a very skilled liar.

21:08.860 --> 21:10.420
Don't worry.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.900
I like both kinds of people.

21:16.590 --> 21:20.380
<i>I'm gonna go ahead and work 
undercover, Senku-chan.</i>

21:21.890 --> 21:25.060
<i>Wanna acquire this whole thing?</i>

21:25.060 --> 21:30.890
<i>The entire revival fluid factory... 
The whole damn cornfield and all.</i>

21:31.920 --> 21:36.260
So all we need to do is to take 
down this so-called science leader.

21:38.260 --> 21:41.110
And this scientist's name?

21:41.110 --> 21:41.930
<i>Welp...</i>

21:42.860 --> 21:45.740
<i>I think I'm totally screwed!</i>

21:45.740 --> 21:50.620
<i>If I'm being honest, Senku-chan's 
totally useless in battle.</i>

21:51.020 --> 21:52.660
<i>Who's tough?</i>

21:52.660 --> 21:57.360
<i>Who might offer to fight on our behalf?</i>

21:58.690 --> 22:02.070
The scientist's name...

22:06.740 --> 22:07.980
is Taiju.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.330
Dr. Taiju.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.470
This is exhilarating!
