<b>I only realized it

<b>what troubles people the most

02:04.990 --> 02:08.410
<b>They… They can't hold objects.</b>

02:08.500 --> 02:11.290
<b>Without nails, we have no grip.</b>

02:12.130 --> 02:13.290
<b>Oh, my!</b>

02:13.800 --> 02:15.670
<b>An answer befitting a scholar.</b>

02:16.260 --> 02:17.760
<b>However, it's incorrect.</b>

02:19.260 --> 02:21.930
<b>The answer is pain.</b>

02:22.010 --> 02:26.560
<b>It's the simplest things

02:37.240 --> 02:38.440
<b>Now then,</b>

02:38.950 --> 02:43.240
<b>you've hidden research materials

<b>Where are they?</b>

<b>Where?</b>

02:59.630 --> 03:01.300

<b>You…</b>

03:08.930 --> 03:10.060
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

03:10.140 --> 03:13.310
<b>Are you by chance a strong-willed fellow?</b>

03:13.940 --> 03:15.570
<b>What a bother.</b>

03:15.650 --> 03:17.940
<b>This could take a while.</b>

03:18.440 --> 03:20.570
<b>I'd like to go home early.</b>

03:22.200 --> 03:23.990
<b>I only have ten nails.</b>

<b>Just get it over with!</b>

<b>For Negri… 68.</b>

03:40.800 --> 03:41.630
<b>What?</b>

03:42.380 --> 03:44.510
<b>Nails grow back, you know.</b>

03:50.100 --> 03:52.060
<b>Okay, everyone. I have a question.</b>

03:52.560 --> 03:55.770
<b>What lies at the center of the universe?</b>

03:56.650 --> 03:57.860
<b>Sir! I know!</b>

03:57.940 --> 03:58.980
<b>Oh!</b>

03:59.070 --> 04:00.740
<b>Go on, Kochanski.</b>

04:01.440 --> 04:03.240
<b>It's love!</b>

04:03.320 --> 04:07.740
<b>The center of the universe
overflows with God's love.</b>

04:09.330 --> 04:10.450
<b>That is correct.</b>

04:10.950 --> 04:13.410
<b>But it's a little too abstract.</b>

04:14.040 --> 04:16.250
<b>Anyone else… Oh!</b>

04:16.830 --> 04:17.840
<b>Rafal, go ahead!</b>

04:18.340 --> 04:19.170
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

04:22.010 --> 04:25.510
<b>The center of the universe
is the Earth, of course.</b>

04:26.640 --> 04:28.680
<b>We know this for many reasons.</b>

04:28.760 --> 04:30.600
<b>As Aristotle pointed out,</b>

04:30.680 --> 04:32.770
<b>heavy objects fall downward.</b>

04:34.600 --> 04:37.770
<b>Objects fall to the ground</b>

04:37.860 --> 04:42.400
<b>because the Earth is the lowest sphere
in the center of the universe.</b>

04:42.900 --> 04:44.200
<b>Exactly!</b>

04:45.950 --> 04:48.660
<b>You honor me, my son.</b>

04:49.660 --> 04:51.660
<b>The honor is mine, Professor Potocki.</b>

04:52.160 --> 04:54.580
<b>Come on, are you two bragging?</b>

04:55.580 --> 04:57.380
<b>No, not at all.</b>

04:58.040 --> 04:59.670
<b>The bragging begins now.</b>

05:00.170 --> 05:04.630
<b>Big news! Rafal is going to university!</b>

05:04.720 --> 05:06.010
<b>-What?!
-What?!</b>

05:06.090 --> 05:09.390
<b>These days, only a handful of people
can enter university,</b>

05:09.470 --> 05:13.470
<b>but to do so at age 12 is truly amazing.</b>

05:13.560 --> 05:14.980
<b>It calls for celebration!</b>

05:15.060 --> 05:18.350
<b>-Wow!
-That's awesome!</b>

05:19.230 --> 05:23.440
<b>Rafal, have you thought
of an appropriate field of study?</b>

05:23.530 --> 05:24.530
<b>Mathematics?</b>

05:24.610 --> 05:25.650
<b>Medicine?</b>

05:25.740 --> 05:26.700
<b>Geography?</b>

05:28.530 --> 05:31.830
<b>Of course, I want to study theology.</b>

05:34.250 --> 05:35.540
<b>As we all know,</b>

05:35.620 --> 05:39.040
<b>theology is the highest academic field.</b>

05:39.130 --> 05:41.920
<b>We owe our lives to God.</b>

05:43.090 --> 05:45.840
<b>A theologist analyzes
the holy scripture logically</b>

05:46.420 --> 05:49.260
<b>so that we may deepen our faith.</b>

05:50.180 --> 05:54.060
<b>I don't believe I have
more talent than anyone else.</b>

05:54.560 --> 05:56.310
<b>I am merely lucky.</b>

05:56.930 --> 06:00.560
<b>That's why I want
to repay that good fortune</b>

06:00.650 --> 06:03.820
<b>by choosing a field
that will be useful to the faithful.</b>

06:04.320 --> 06:06.280
<b>Magnificent!</b>

06:06.360 --> 06:08.240
<b>You are an example to us all!</b>

06:10.070 --> 06:11.200
<b>Oh, stop.</b>

06:14.700 --> 06:15.750
<b>This world</b>

06:15.830 --> 06:17.120
<b>is so easy!</b>

06:22.460 --> 06:24.300
<b>Though it pains me to say it,</b>

06:24.380 --> 06:26.210
<b>the world is full of fools.</b>

06:27.630 --> 06:30.090
<b>I myself was born an orphan,</b>

06:30.180 --> 06:34.140
<b>so I've had my share of poverty,
misery, pity, vulnerability,</b>

06:34.220 --> 06:35.970
<b>and every other disadvantage.</b>

06:36.600 --> 06:40.020
<b>But above all that,
I'm good at living smart.</b>

06:41.100 --> 06:42.270
<b>Really good.</b>

06:44.520 --> 06:45.940
<b>My philosophy</b>

06:46.030 --> 06:47.610
<b>is to live rationally.</b>

06:48.400 --> 06:51.070
<b>If one ignores
irrational emotions like love,</b>

06:51.160 --> 06:53.160
<b>avoids wasteful desires,</b>

06:53.660 --> 06:57.500
<b>and makes reasonable decisions,
one can live comfortably.</b>

07:01.170 --> 07:02.830
<b>That which is rational</b>

07:02.920 --> 07:04.790
<b>is always beautiful.</b>

07:05.750 --> 07:08.460
<b>By sticking to that belief,</b>

07:08.970 --> 07:12.970
<b>people now see me as dignified,
wise, humble, and capable.</b>

07:16.180 --> 07:19.430
<b>University? That's awesome, Rafal!</b>

07:19.520 --> 07:21.060
<b>I can brag about knowing you!</b>

07:21.140 --> 07:23.190
<b>No, I'm nothing special.</b>

07:24.230 --> 07:27.480
<b>Simpletons like this guy Kochanski</b>

07:27.570 --> 07:30.860
<b>respect me right away,
so they're good to have around.</b>

07:31.360 --> 07:32.660
<b>You're a genius.</b>

07:33.660 --> 07:34.820
<b>Not at all.</b>

07:34.910 --> 07:35.910
<b>A sage.</b>

07:36.410 --> 07:37.950
<b>You're exaggerating.</b>

07:38.040 --> 07:39.950
<b>No, more like a god!</b>

07:40.040 --> 07:40.960
<b>Uh-oh.</b>

07:45.590 --> 07:46.420
<b>God?</b>

07:46.920 --> 07:48.340
<b>What are you saying?</b>

07:49.050 --> 07:50.800
<b>Humans cannot be gods.</b>

07:51.670 --> 07:53.590
<b>Please retract that comment.</b>

07:57.390 --> 07:59.270
<b>I take it back.</b>

08:00.180 --> 08:01.270
<b>Forgive me.</b>

08:02.520 --> 08:04.100
<b>Be careful from now on.</b>

08:05.440 --> 08:06.270
<b>You idiot.</b>

08:06.360 --> 08:08.440
<b>Some things can't be said aloud.</b>

08:10.740 --> 08:13.400
<b>That concludes today's lesson.</b>

08:13.490 --> 08:14.860
<b>May God bless you.</b>

08:18.120 --> 08:19.490
<b>Oh, Rafal.</b>

08:19.580 --> 08:21.450
<b>-I have a favor to ask.
-Oh?</b>

08:21.950 --> 08:23.250
<b>What is it?</b>

08:23.330 --> 08:25.330
<b>I need you to-- Huh?</b>

08:25.830 --> 08:27.340
<b>Is that a catalog of stars?</b>

08:27.420 --> 08:28.790
<b>Uh, yes!</b>

08:28.880 --> 08:31.590
<b>Yesterday, I saw my first
sixth-magnitude star.</b>

08:31.670 --> 08:33.130
<b>It was so exciting!</b>

08:34.220 --> 08:35.380
<b>I see.</b>

08:35.470 --> 08:37.090
<b>Then you must stop.</b>

08:37.180 --> 08:38.010
<b>What?</b>

08:38.680 --> 08:42.310
<b>You must devote all your time
to theology from now on.</b>

08:42.810 --> 08:44.350
<b>No more astronomy.</b>

08:45.900 --> 08:46.850
<b>Understood?</b>

08:49.570 --> 08:51.820
<b>Y-Yes sir.</b>

08:52.610 --> 08:53.570
<b>Good.</b>

08:53.650 --> 08:55.450
<b>As for the favor,</b>

08:55.950 --> 08:59.660
<b>I'd like you to pick up
my acquaintance Hubert tomorrow.</b>

09:01.040 --> 09:02.540
<b>Hubert?</b>

09:02.620 --> 09:05.040
<b>Wasn't he arrested as a heretic?</b>

09:05.540 --> 09:07.630
<b>Something about forbidden research.</b>

09:08.460 --> 09:10.500
<b>Is it okay to take him in?</b>

09:10.590 --> 09:12.460
<b>Yes. It's fine.</b>

09:12.550 --> 09:14.800
<b>He recanted, so they're releasing him.</b>

09:15.300 --> 09:18.970
<b>Willingness to forgive sins
is a sign of devout faith.</b>

09:19.550 --> 09:22.100
<b>I'll be loaning him
a place to live as well.</b>

09:22.600 --> 09:24.390
<b>Now then. I'm counting on you.</b>

09:41.240 --> 09:44.540
<b>You must devote all your time
to theology from now on.</b>

09:45.040 --> 09:46.330
<b>No more astronomy.</b>

09:48.080 --> 09:49.380
<b>It's only natural.</b>

09:50.130 --> 09:52.090
<b>I've got no time for astronomy.</b>

10:08.100 --> 10:10.770
<b>Stop it.
You've got to forget about the sky.</b>

10:10.860 --> 10:12.150
<b>What does it matter?</b>

10:13.360 --> 10:15.570
<b>There was a time
when I saw a rational beauty</b>

10:16.070 --> 10:19.160
<b>in the orderly movements of stars.</b>

10:19.910 --> 10:21.280
<b>But when I looked deeper,</b>

10:21.370 --> 10:24.620
<b>every star's movement
has its own complex calculations.</b>

10:26.160 --> 10:29.120
<b>Continuing with astronomy isn't rational.</b>

10:29.870 --> 10:30.960
<b>Plus,</b>

10:31.040 --> 10:33.130
<b>the world of stars is so far away.</b>

10:34.670 --> 10:36.460
<b>No matter how we stretch,</b>

10:37.090 --> 10:38.720
<b>no human can ever reach them.</b>

10:51.350 --> 10:52.520
<b>Hubert…</b>

10:53.020 --> 10:55.650
<b>A former scholar and heretic.</b>

10:55.730 --> 10:57.650
<b>What kind of person could he be?</b>

10:57.740 --> 10:59.530
<b>No matter how you look at it,</b>

10:59.610 --> 11:01.240
<b>it's not a smart way to live.</b>

11:05.790 --> 11:07.200
<b>Speak of the devil.</b>

11:07.700 --> 11:10.710
<b>A heretic was scheduled
for execution today.</b>

11:22.050 --> 11:24.850
<b>Come on, they defied God!</b>

11:24.930 --> 11:27.350
<b>Surely there were chances to recant.</b>

11:27.430 --> 11:29.600
<b>They brought it on themselves.</b>

11:30.310 --> 11:33.350
<b>Hurry up and burn already.</b>

11:36.480 --> 11:38.030
<b>What's taking so long?</b>

11:38.820 --> 11:40.860
<b>What's with that guy?</b>

11:42.200 --> 11:43.860
<b>Let's get out of here.</b>

11:47.740 --> 11:49.250
<b>Excuse me!</b>

11:49.870 --> 11:52.540
<b>I'm Rafal, ward of Potocki.</b>

11:53.120 --> 11:54.670
<b>I'm here for Hubert.</b>

11:54.750 --> 11:56.090
<b>Oh, uh…</b>

11:57.500 --> 11:58.670
<b>Right.</b>

12:18.770 --> 12:20.900
<b>Whoa! He's huge!</b>

12:20.990 --> 12:24.070
<b>This guy is suspicious to the core!</b>

12:25.910 --> 12:27.070
<b>Pleasure to meet you.</b>

12:27.160 --> 12:29.200
<b>I'm Potocki's ward, Rafal.</b>

12:30.040 --> 12:31.700
<b>I look forward to knowing you.</b>

12:35.620 --> 12:36.460
<b>Huh?</b>

12:36.960 --> 12:38.790
<b>Uh, um…</b>

12:39.710 --> 12:42.300
<b>I offer no benefit to you.</b>

12:43.130 --> 12:46.430
<b>You don't have to win
my favor with a false smile.</b>

12:46.930 --> 12:47.800
<b>What?</b>

12:48.300 --> 12:49.560
<b>But…</b>

12:49.640 --> 12:51.680
<b>Now then. Please guide me.</b>

13:16.870 --> 13:18.000
<b>I've heard about you.</b>

13:19.460 --> 13:21.090
<b>You're going to university?</b>

13:21.590 --> 13:24.090
<b>Uh, yes! It's an honor.</b>

13:24.170 --> 13:26.840
<b>I owe it to God
and everyone who has supported--</b>

13:26.930 --> 13:28.590
<b>Will you study astronomy?</b>

13:28.680 --> 13:29.510
<b>What?</b>

13:29.600 --> 13:30.890
<b>You must look at stars</b>

13:31.390 --> 13:33.470
<b>if you carry an astrolabe.</b>

13:33.970 --> 13:36.640
<b>Oh, uh… This is…</b>

13:37.350 --> 13:40.650
<b>How do I put it? It's just a hobby.</b>

13:40.730 --> 13:42.610
<b>I've been thinking of quitting.</b>

13:43.110 --> 13:44.780
<b>I'm going to study theology--</b>

13:45.690 --> 13:46.900
<b>You're rather insincere.</b>

13:46.990 --> 13:47.820
<b>Huh?</b>

14:05.710 --> 14:09.130
<b>So, Hubert, what were you
researching before?</b>

14:14.470 --> 14:17.310
<b>Is that wax tablet
a record of your observations?</b>

14:18.390 --> 14:20.350
<b>Yes.</b>

14:21.230 --> 14:22.940
<b>To the best of my ability, I--</b>

14:23.020 --> 14:25.780
<b>-Show me.
-Whoa! Hey…</b>

14:36.700 --> 14:37.870
<b>Excellent.</b>

14:38.370 --> 14:39.210
<b>What?</b>

14:39.870 --> 14:42.380
<b>You've seen all the way
to the sixth magnitude.</b>

14:42.880 --> 14:44.340
<b>You have good eyes.</b>

14:44.420 --> 14:45.300
<b>What?</b>

14:46.340 --> 14:48.220
<b>Oh, but those are just jottings.</b>

14:48.720 --> 14:52.260
<b>I have more precise notes at home.</b>

14:52.340 --> 14:54.560
<b>You do? I'd like to see them.</b>

14:55.180 --> 14:57.390
<b>I can continue my research with these.</b>

14:57.470 --> 14:58.310
<b>Right!</b>

14:58.810 --> 14:59.810
<b>Of course, I--</b>

15:01.020 --> 15:02.150
<b>Huh?</b>

15:02.230 --> 15:04.520
<b>Did you say… research?</b>

15:05.020 --> 15:07.650
<b>You abandoned your research, didn't you?</b>

15:08.530 --> 15:09.990
<b>I'm a scholar.</b>

15:10.610 --> 15:14.410
<b>No matter what anyone says,
I will never abandon my research.</b>

15:14.490 --> 15:18.790
<b>Huh? Does that mean you haven't recanted?</b>

15:19.370 --> 15:22.460
<b>Of course not.
I lied to obtain my release.</b>

15:23.210 --> 15:27.130
<b>Although, I will keep up the act
to avoid being caught.</b>

15:27.630 --> 15:28.460
<b>Wha--</b>

15:30.760 --> 15:34.390
<b>Why did you reveal that so bluntly?</b>

15:34.890 --> 15:38.810
<b>Because I'm about to blackmail you.</b>

15:43.190 --> 15:44.190
<b>What?!</b>

15:45.730 --> 15:46.730
<b>Listen to me.</b>

15:46.820 --> 15:48.860
<b>Research requires observation.</b>

15:49.440 --> 15:51.990
<b>However, my eyes have weakened.</b>

15:52.490 --> 15:54.450
<b>That's why I'll use yours.</b>

15:55.030 --> 15:57.740
<b>A heretic caught twice
is immediately executed.</b>

15:58.660 --> 15:59.870
<b>I'm out of chances.</b>

16:00.960 --> 16:03.870
<b>I came back to finish what I started.</b>

16:04.630 --> 16:06.920
<b>And I'll jump through fire to do it.</b>

16:07.000 --> 16:09.920
<b>My apologies,
but if you refuse, I'll kill you.</b>

16:10.010 --> 16:11.670
<b>If you interfere, I'll kill you.</b>

16:12.170 --> 16:15.430
<b>If you don't do what I say
at all times, I'll kill you.</b>

16:16.260 --> 16:18.140
<b>So continue astronomy!</b>

16:18.640 --> 16:19.890
<b>For my sake.</b>

16:20.390 --> 16:21.680
<b>That's an order.</b>

16:22.310 --> 16:23.310
<b>Understood?</b>

16:23.390 --> 16:25.810
<b>Y-Yes! I'll do it!</b>

16:25.900 --> 16:27.440
<b>I'll do anything you say!</b>

16:31.610 --> 16:33.110
<b>Don't worry.</b>

16:33.200 --> 16:35.070
<b>I'm not an unreasonable man.</b>

16:35.160 --> 16:38.830
<b>I-I'm glad to hear you say that.</b>

16:38.910 --> 16:41.160
<b>Where do you usually observe?</b>

16:42.830 --> 16:45.120
<b>A hill to the southeast.</b>

16:45.830 --> 16:47.920
<b>I know a better spot.</b>

16:48.540 --> 16:51.380
<b>You're in for a surprise.
I'll tell you tomorrow.</b>

16:52.090 --> 16:53.630
<b>R-Right.</b>

16:54.220 --> 16:56.430
<b>Well, I'll be going.</b>

17:04.100 --> 17:05.810
<b>What the heck?!</b>

17:08.480 --> 17:11.320
<b>Why the heck did they let that creep out?</b>

17:11.400 --> 17:12.820
<b>He should be burned alive!</b>

17:12.900 --> 17:14.360
<b>I'll turn him in right away.</b>

17:14.450 --> 17:16.660
<b>Does he really think I'll go tomorrow?!</b>

17:17.990 --> 17:20.030
<b>I know a better spot.</b>

17:20.660 --> 17:21.740
<b>You're in for a surprise.</b>

17:28.580 --> 17:32.050
<b>Come on. This is way too dangerous.</b>

17:33.010 --> 17:34.510
<b>There's no way I'll go.</b>

17:34.590 --> 17:36.340
<b>Nothing good will come of it!</b>

17:42.510 --> 17:44.100
<b>Wow… Amazing!</b>

17:44.180 --> 17:45.480
<b>I'm so glad I came!</b>

17:45.560 --> 17:47.690
<b>I never knew they could be so clear!</b>

17:49.900 --> 17:51.110
<b>Indeed.</b>

17:51.190 --> 17:54.070
<b>The altitude is high,
the field of view is broad,</b>

17:54.570 --> 17:56.530
<b>and the air is clear.</b>

17:57.400 --> 17:59.200
<b>It's perfect for observation.</b>

18:00.740 --> 18:01.740
<b>Not only that…</b>

18:03.120 --> 18:08.120
<b>I'm fond of the way those mountains
and rocks resemble Orion's Belt.</b>

18:09.000 --> 18:10.540
<b>Oh… right.</b>

18:12.290 --> 18:14.420
<b>Observation is difficult
once the moon is out.</b>

18:14.920 --> 18:17.590
<b>I'll calculate the time retroactively,</b>

18:17.670 --> 18:19.380
<b>so make your record now.</b>

18:19.470 --> 18:20.300
<b>Right.</b>

18:36.110 --> 18:37.490
<b>Is this good enough?</b>

18:50.790 --> 18:53.710
<b>Incredible.
This many in such a short time.</b>

18:54.210 --> 18:56.920
<b>Oh, uh… thanks.</b>

19:01.550 --> 19:03.300
<b>-Excuse me.
-Hmm?</b>

19:03.800 --> 19:08.180
<b>What exactly will you
use these records for?</b>

19:09.600 --> 19:12.560
<b>This forbidden research of yours…</b>

19:14.060 --> 19:16.190
<b>What is it?</b>

19:21.200 --> 19:24.070
<b>Have you heard of Aristarchus?</b>

19:24.160 --> 19:26.160
<b>Huh? What is that?</b>

19:27.490 --> 19:31.080
<b>In that case, do you know the shape</b>

19:31.790 --> 19:32.920
<b>of the cosmos?</b>

19:33.420 --> 19:34.420
<b>Huh?</b>

19:34.500 --> 19:35.540
<b>Yes.</b>

19:35.630 --> 19:37.420
<b>Earth is at the center,</b>

19:37.500 --> 19:41.340
<b>and all the heavenly bodies
perform complex revolutions around it.</b>

19:42.050 --> 19:44.510
<b>-Draw it for me then.
-What?</b>

19:54.060 --> 19:55.860
<b>Something like this, I think.</b>

19:56.650 --> 19:58.230
<b>It's hard to understand,</b>

19:58.320 --> 20:02.360
<b>but Ptolemy discovered the truth
over 1,000 years ago.</b>

20:03.200 --> 20:07.830
<b>Plus, common sense
tells us that the Earth is special.</b>

20:07.910 --> 20:11.210
<b>I believe God
would place it at the center.</b>

20:12.830 --> 20:13.870
<b>Indeed.</b>

20:14.460 --> 20:18.210
<b>In that case,
is there beauty in such truth?</b>

20:18.960 --> 20:20.210
<b>What?</b>

20:20.300 --> 20:23.720
<b>Is the universe you described beautiful?</b>

20:29.180 --> 20:33.640
<b>Whether it's beautiful or not
depends on the sense of the individual.</b>

20:33.730 --> 20:36.310
<b>It has nothing to do with scholarly truth.</b>

20:36.810 --> 20:38.480
<b>You didn't answer the question.</b>

20:39.690 --> 20:42.780
<b>Do you find it to be beautiful?</b>

20:53.120 --> 20:57.250
<b>Well, it does seem
a little too complicated.</b>

20:58.000 --> 21:02.340
<b>With this model, every planet
has to be calculated separately.</b>

21:03.260 --> 21:05.510
<b>The way the movements fail to form</b>

21:05.590 --> 21:07.390
<b>a single orderly system…</b>

21:09.390 --> 21:10.970
<b>doesn't seem rational.</b>

21:11.470 --> 21:13.810
<b>In that sense,</b>

21:15.480 --> 21:16.980
<b>it's not very beautiful.</b>

21:19.310 --> 21:22.900
<b>But while the lack
of beauty is unfortunate,</b>

21:23.400 --> 21:28.120
<b>there could never be one system
that accounted for the entire universe.</b>

21:28.620 --> 21:31.450
<b>It makes no sense
to fault the universe for that.</b>

21:31.540 --> 21:33.450
<b>No, it's a major fault.</b>

21:33.540 --> 21:34.410
<b>What?</b>

21:35.250 --> 21:38.670
<b>I don't want to live
in a universe that isn't beautiful.</b>

21:40.210 --> 21:41.960
<b>Even if that's the case,</b>

21:42.050 --> 21:45.920
<b>to place beauty before logic
is just plain backwards.</b>

21:46.510 --> 21:49.590
<b>It may be complicated,
but the theory is highly accurate.</b>

21:50.350 --> 21:53.520
<b>As long as the stars move
and the sun rises, that is.</b>

21:54.020 --> 21:58.440
<b>And what if neither the sun
nor the stars actually move?</b>

22:00.560 --> 22:03.440
<b>Come on, a theory like that
would never hold up.</b>

22:03.530 --> 22:05.150
<b>But it does.</b>

22:05.650 --> 22:10.570
<b>If that's true, then what's moving
in the universe as we speak?</b>

22:10.660 --> 22:12.030
<b>The Earth.</b>

22:12.530 --> 22:15.790
<b>The Earth? But that's--</b>

22:18.620 --> 22:20.750
<b>Wait… The Earth?</b>

22:24.380 --> 22:25.420
<b>That's right.</b>

22:25.920 --> 22:29.550
<b>The sun does not rise. We descend.</b>

22:31.350 --> 22:33.310
<b>Morning comes every day</b>

22:33.390 --> 22:35.810
<b>because the Earth rotates</b>

22:35.890 --> 22:37.730
<b>on its own axis.</b>

22:38.940 --> 22:41.190
<b>In addition, the seasons change</b>

22:41.270 --> 22:45.730
<b>because the Earth moves
in an orbital revolution around the sun.</b>

22:46.570 --> 22:51.110
<b>In my universe,
the Earth moves in two ways.</b>

22:54.200 --> 22:56.870
<b>Meanwhile, the sun remains still,</b>

22:57.500 --> 23:00.290
<b>and the individual planets
move in sequence.</b>

23:00.790 --> 23:03.840
<b>The cosmos is unified
under a single order.</b>

23:03.920 --> 23:05.960
<b>Common sense is overturned.</b>

23:06.050 --> 23:08.260
<b>The Church is enraged.</b>

23:08.840 --> 23:11.470
<b>Reason and beauty become one.</b>

23:13.430 --> 23:15.600
<b>That is my research.</b>

23:17.720 --> 23:19.060
<b>I suppose</b>

23:19.560 --> 23:20.600
<b>we could call it…</b>

23:24.610 --> 23:26.610
<b>heliocentrism.</b>

23:26.690 --> 23:28.320
<b>How about that?</b>
