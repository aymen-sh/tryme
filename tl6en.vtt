WEBVTT

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.824
Henry, give me the gun.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:16.659
Come on, give me the gun.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.495
- What did I do?
- Shh.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.371
Gimme the gun.

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:23.457
Gimme the gun, Henry.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:25.209
Gimme the gun. Shh.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.836
Henry, no!

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:28.898
And the gun.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.358
Who the hell are you?

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.945
Just someone passin' through.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.074
Take the gun out, two fingers
only, put it outta reach.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.666
Why didn't you shoot him?

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.252
The gun's all the way
over there.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:54.132
- He didn't hurt me, by the way.
- Yeah, I got eyes.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.385
You made him soup?

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:59.428
Yeah, I did.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.181
- It's cold out.
- I'm lookin' for my brother.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.768
- Well, I ain't seen him.
- I haven't told you what he looks like.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.937
- He look anything like you?
- A bit.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.815
- Then I ain't seen him.
- He's got a girl with him.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.609
Can I come down?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.737
No. Ellie!

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:20.782
What did I just say?

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:22.534
Joel, come on.
They're, like, a thousand.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:25.412
- Who's this little psycho?
- Never mind her.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.039
I need you to tell us
where we are.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.041
- If you got a map, why you lost?
- Must've missed all

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.168
the street signs in the
enormous fucking forest.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.379
Ho-ly.

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:37.966
We're somewhere here.
Exactly where?

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.303
And your answer better be
the same as your wife's.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:42.971
Did you tell him the truth?

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.598
Yeah.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.808
Are you tellin' me the truth?

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.144
Yeah.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:04.326
Well, you found a great
place to hide, I guess.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.161
Hide?

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.371
Came here before
you were born, sonny.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:11.960
- Get the hell away from everybody.
- I didn't want to.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.672
Listen, I didn't mean to upset
you about your brother,

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.090
but if you've come this far,

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.300
then you know what's out there.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.052
- You seen Cody?
- Yeah, got close enough.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.512
It's crawling with Infected.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.931
Yeah, Laramie and
Wind River Reservation.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.684
Anywhere people used to be,

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:29.768
you can't go there no more.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.020
- So you haven't heard the name Tommy?
- Nope.

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.064
What about the Fireflies?

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.899
We get those in the summer.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.859
Not the bugs, the people.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.460
There are firefly people?

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:46.686
- You got any advice on the best way west?
- Yeah.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.914
Go east.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.501
But you never go
past the river here.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.753
- Ever.
- What's past the river?

00:04:56.754 --> 00:04:59.297
Death.

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:01.508
We never seen who's out there,

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.220
but we see the bodies
they leave behind.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:08.223
Some Infected, some not.

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:12.770
If your brother's west
of the river, he's gone.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.567
You're not gonna scare us.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.820
Scared him.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.752
You don't seriously
believe them.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.838
They've lived here a long time.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.257
- Put that back.
- They don't know anything.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:43.968
Never heard of the Fireflies.

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:50.974
Joel? Joel?

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.225
Joel, are you okay?

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:53.643
- Joel?
- Shut up.

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:54.770
Holy shit, are you dying?

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.897
I'm okay.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.982
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, are you okay?

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:00.776
- I'm fine.
- No, no, but are you? Because just a reminder

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.277
that if you're dead, I'm fucked.

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:04.780
- I said I'm fine.
- Okay.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.326
It's just the...
cold air all of a sudden.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.539
All right, uh...

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.461
so let's go and find Tommy
and, and the Fireflies.

00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:21.296
It's gonna be easy.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:24.133
All we have to do
is cross the River of Death.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.803
The River of Death. Scary.

00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:56.414
Don't start.

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:58.959
It's too close to dark.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.444
There's some caves
along the river.

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:02.546
We'll set up camp there,
cross in the mornin'.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.131
Good. I'm starving.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.423
Should've stolen two rabbits.

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:08.026
- We can get our own rabbits.
- You gonna teach me how?

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.180
Just keep movin'.

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:42.003
Come down from there. You're
gonna break your neck.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:56.933
Ahh... Can I have some?

00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:58.727
- No.
- What? Just to warm up.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.021
C'mon.

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:16.204
Yep... still gross.

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:26.963
So, I've been thinking.

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:28.882
Let's say we find the Fireflies,

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:29.759
it all works,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.427
they draw my blood
and put it through

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:34.931
some of their fancy
machines and make a cure.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.224
Okay?

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.518
Then what?

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.562
- Like, what do we do?
- Oh, it's "we"?

00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:44.272
Okay, fine. Whatever. You.

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:46.441
You can do anything you want.

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:50.612
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.864
It's never been an option.

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:55.034
Maybe...

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:59.246
an old farmhouse, some land...

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:02.257
- a ranch.
- Cool. What kind?

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.626
Sheep.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:06.629
- I would raise sheep.
- Sheep.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.756
They're quiet...

00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:11.091
do what they're told.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.760
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.889
So, just you and a buncha sheep.

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:18.891
Romantic.

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:24.680
And what about you?
Where are you gonna go?

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.488
It's probably because
I grew up in the QZ.

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:34.990
Behind you, there's ocean,

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.117
and ahead of you,
there's a wall.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.661
Nowhere else to look but up.

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.997
I read everything I could
in the school library.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.374
Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell.

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:46.585
But you know who my favorite is?

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:50.922
- Sally Ride.
- Sally fuckin' Ride!

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:52.883
Best astronaut name ever.

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:07.315
It'll work, right?

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:10.317
The vaccine?

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.098
It's a little late
to start wonderin'.

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:16.865
- I tried, with Sam.
- Tried what?

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.159
I knew he was infected.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.369
I rubbed some of my
blood into his bite.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.019
I know, I know, it was stupid.

00:10:23.044 --> 00:10:23.813
But I...

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:29.045
I wanted to save him.

00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:36.718
Well, I reckon it's a lot
more complicated than that.

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:40.930
Marlene, she's a lotta things, but...
she's no fool.

00:10:40.931 --> 00:10:43.768
If she says they can
do it, they can do it.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.931
You wanna take first
watch or second?

00:10:55.156 --> 00:10:56.538
I'll do both.

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:58.199
Get some sleep.

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:02.036
Dream of...

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.022
sheep ranches on the moon.

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.458
I will.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.562
Still mumbling in your sleep.

00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:32.607
I woke up early. You were passed
out, so I took second watch.

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:35.318
You gotta wake me up
if that happens.

00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:38.238
- You can't do things like this.
- But I can...

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.322
'cause I just did.

00:11:39.323 --> 00:11:42.075
I'm responsible for you, okay?

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:43.326
Then don't fall asleep.

00:11:44.327 --> 00:11:46.996
I was quiet, I checked my six,

00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:49.290
I looked for tracks,
I found the high ground,

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.959
and I kept watch.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.711
Like you taught me to.

00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:56.423
What can I say, man?
I'm a natural.

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.645
You wake me up next time.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:11.897
Yes, sir.

00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:29.064
The River of Death. Still no people.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.584
Fine.

00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:32.727
I'm learning how to whistle.

00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:34.187
You don't know how to whistle?

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:35.897
Does it sound like
I know how to whistle?

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:38.066
No.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:41.569
Seriously, though,
how the fuck do you do that?

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.571
- Talent.
- Whatever.

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:45.657
You should teach me how to hunt.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:46.950
- Huh.
- "Huh." Like,

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.286
"She's a girl.
She can't handle it."

00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:52.497
You can handle the shootin'.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:55.583
- Not so sure about the dressin'.
- What's the dressin'?

00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:58.211
- The part where you take the guts out.
- Oh, yeah.

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.796
Why do they call it dressing?

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:01.923
It's like, you should
call it undressing

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.633
'cause it is. It's like...

00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:06.387
undressing from the inside.

00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:10.274
Still interested, though.

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:22.570
Dam.

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:25.113
You're no Will Livingston.

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.074
Yeah, yeah, but who is?

00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:30.743
- So that made electricity?
- Yeah.

00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:34.455
Don't ask me.
I don't have a clue.

00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:36.499
You know, you could've
just made something up.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.377
I would've believed you.

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:42.881
Look at that river.
It's crazy blue.

00:14:49.096 --> 00:14:54.310
Hey, Joel... what if this
is the River of Death?

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.425
Get behind me.

00:15:28.969 --> 00:15:30.345
We ain't lookin'
for any trouble.

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:32.013
We're just passin' through.

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:33.390
Drop the gun.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.153
You...

00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:48.446
take five steps back.

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:49.821
How 'bout we just
talk this through?

00:15:49.846 --> 00:15:51.157
How 'bout you
shut the fuck up?

00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:52.785
Okay, easy.

00:15:58.207 --> 00:15:59.541
You'll be okay.

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.461
You been near Infected?

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:05.614
- There's no Infected out here.
- The hell there ain't.

00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:13.388
Last chance for a bullet.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:17.226
If you've been infected, he will
smell it, and he will rip you up.

00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:38.497
Like I said...
we'll just move on.

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:41.125
Now her.

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:10.946
Hi.

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:16.410
Hi.

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:24.792
You just bought yourself
10 more seconds.

00:17:24.793 --> 00:17:26.745
What are you doin' out here?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.672
I'm just lookin' for my brother.

00:17:29.673 --> 00:17:31.008
- That's all, nothin' more.
- Ho!

00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:39.266
What's your name?

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:44.897
Joel.

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.683
Tommy!

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:31.086
What the fuck you doin' here?

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.923
I came here to save you.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.861
There's more if you need it.

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:58.446
Thank you, ma'am.

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:00.448
It's been a while since
we've had a proper meal.

00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:02.408
Actually, I don't think I've
ever had a proper meal.

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:03.744
This is fuckin' amazing.

00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:06.370
Sorry.

00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:07.622
Ellie...

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.207
let's mind our manners.

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:16.714
What?

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:18.966
- What's wrong with you?
- What about her manners?

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:20.885
She was just curious.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.095
Kids around here don't usually
look or talk like you.

00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:26.058
Right... well, maybe
I'll teach them.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:29.477
And I want my gun back.

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:31.188
They also aren't armed.

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:33.314
You know what? Uh...

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:36.359
I think maybe y'all got a
little off on the wrong foot.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.610
She was gonna have
her guys kill us.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:38.778
Well, we gotta be real careful

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:39.696
about who we let in this place.

00:20:39.697 --> 00:20:41.822
But it's all bark.
We're just tryna scare off

00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:43.199
those who might
wanna try us is all.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.659
Well, you got a couple
of 90-year-olds

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.369
- shitting themselves out there.
- Ellie.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.037
They say that you leave
dead bodies around?

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:49.580
Those are the people
who tried us.

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:52.166
A bad reputation
doesn't mean you're bad.

00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:53.377
Not always, at least.

00:20:58.715 --> 00:21:00.424
Ma'am...

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:04.178
we're grateful for
your hospitality and all.

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:06.974
But it'd be nice to have a moment
here, maybe just for family.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.227
Well, um...

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.231
Maria is family, actually.

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:19.069
Oh, shit! Congrats.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.907
Joel, say congrats.

00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:30.122
Congrats.

00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:35.159
- How 'bout a tour?
- Yeah.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.629
We settled here
about seven years ago.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.214
Just a handful of us back then.

00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:42.550
That section was already
a gated community,

00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:44.176
so we built the rest of
the wall out from there.

00:21:44.177 --> 00:21:46.554
Stopped most
of the raiding parties,

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.389
but we still find
pockets of them.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.225
- And you said Infected?
- Yeah, but usually smaller colonies,

00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:52.560
wandered off from the cities.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:54.562
All this open
country out here...

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:56.230
it's a turkey shoot.

00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:59.233
I still got my 700, but I
found a variable power scope.

00:21:59.234 --> 00:22:00.818
Sub-MOA.

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.695
Can headshot those fuckers
from a half mile out.

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:05.332
- Can you teach me how?
- No, he can't.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.418
How do you keep
this place quiet?

00:22:07.443 --> 00:22:09.577
Carefully. Being in the
middle of nowhere helps.

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:10.911
Not advertising what we have,

00:22:10.912 --> 00:22:12.121
staying off the radio.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:14.790
House of worship, multifaith.

00:22:14.791 --> 00:22:17.418
School. Laundry.

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:18.753
Old bank works as the jail,

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.004
not that we've needed it.

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.505
And you draw power from the dam?

00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:23.382
Got that workin'
a couple years ago.

00:22:23.383 --> 00:22:25.634
After that, sewage,
plumbing, water heaters...

00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:27.720
lights.

00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:29.931
This place actually
fuckin' works.

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:36.480
Hey, Joel, check it. Baa.

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:41.817
So are you, like, in charge?

00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:43.778
No one person's in charge.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:44.945
I'm on the council.

00:22:44.946 --> 00:22:46.280
Democratically elected,

00:22:46.281 --> 00:22:48.657
serving 300 people,
including children.

00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:50.701
Everyone pitches in.
We rotate patrols,

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:53.370
food prep, repairs,
hunting, harvesting.

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:55.372
Everything you see
in our town...

00:22:55.373 --> 00:22:58.626
greenhouses, livestock,
all shared.

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.544
Collective ownership.

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:02.296
So, uh, communism.

00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:04.757
Nah. Nah, it ain't like that.

00:23:04.758 --> 00:23:05.790
It is that. Literally.

00:23:05.815 --> 00:23:07.785
This is a commune.
We're communists.

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:12.681
- No way!
- That's our newest one.

00:23:12.682 --> 00:23:14.433
Couple months old.
You wanna pet her?

00:23:14.434 --> 00:23:16.143
- Yeah, what's her name?
- Shimmer.

00:23:16.144 --> 00:23:18.395
Shimmer. You're so beautiful.

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:20.773
Well, I'm sure they'd like a
shower, some new clothes.

00:23:20.774 --> 00:23:21.982
We can put them
in the empty house

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:23.567
- across the street from us.
- Yeah.

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:24.319
It's a decent place.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.487
Pretty much untouched since '03,

00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:27.488
but it's got
the heat goin' in it.

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:30.825
- Could do worse.
- Oh, trust me, we have been.

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:32.410
We've been doin' fine.

00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:38.651
Well, I'll take Ellie over there
if you two wanna catch up?

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:44.588
Yeah. Okay.

00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:46.508
- Joel.
- You'll be fine.

00:23:48.343 --> 00:23:50.010
Shall we?

00:23:50.011 --> 00:23:53.140
Uh, yeah.

00:23:57.185 --> 00:24:00.188
Been a long time.

00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:05.818
Doesn't seem like you aged much.

00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:07.028
You, on the other hand.

00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:15.078
Thanks for still givin'
a shit about me.

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:24.712
Workin' on raisin'
some hogs, too.

00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:27.174
Once we get bacon,
I mean, what's even left?

00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:31.760
Christmas trees and bacon?

00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:33.680
Pretty decent setup.

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:36.224
So, how's Tess?

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:39.476
She's fine.

00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:41.688
- All right.
- Good then.

00:24:43.023 --> 00:24:44.316
And the kid?

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:48.736
Oh, yeah.

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:51.280
She's the daughter of some
Firefly muckety-muck.

00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:55.075
Tryna find her family
somewhere out here.

00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:57.662
- I was headin' in this direction, so...
- Really?

00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.664
Goodness of your heart?

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:01.833
There's a payment.

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:07.421
So you know where they might be?
These Fireflies?

00:25:07.422 --> 00:25:11.342
Well, they got a base down at the
University of Eastern Colorado.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:14.179
It's, uh, a week's ride south.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.220
But it is severely fucked up
between here and there.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.851
Infected... raiders.

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:22.519
It's not exactly an easy trip.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.646
It'll be easy for us,

00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:25.189
seeing as how you
can headshot Infected

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.315
from half a mile away,

00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:30.069
which is a bunch
of bullshit, by the way.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.154
- Yeah, I can't go.
- Oh, come on.

00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:33.614
I made it across the country.

00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:36.076
The two of us can make it
from here to Colorado.

00:25:40.747 --> 00:25:42.081
What, 'cause your
wife won't let you?

00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:44.541
- Joel.
- She the one who kept you off the radio?

00:25:44.542 --> 00:25:46.293
Is that why you stopped
messaging me back?

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:47.128
After I ditched the Fireflies,

00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:49.464
Maria and her crew found me.

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:52.466
They're good people.

00:25:52.467 --> 00:25:54.207
They didn't have to
take me in, but they did.

00:25:54.232 --> 00:25:56.136
And all they ask is that
I follow their rules.

00:25:56.137 --> 00:25:57.781
- I'm your brother.
- Yeah, I'm aware.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.592
They're very protective
of this place,

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:03.185
and for good fuckin' reason.

00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:04.789
I mean, folks find
out we're up here...

00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:05.579
No, I heard.

00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:07.606
Wrong people might show up.

00:26:07.607 --> 00:26:11.235
So is that what I am?
Am I the wrong people?

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:12.903
- Joel...
- Those things I did, Tommy,

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:14.655
those things that
you judge me for,

00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:16.198
I did those things
to keep us alive.

00:26:16.199 --> 00:26:17.825
We did those things.

00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:20.244
And they weren't "things."

00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:21.328
We murdered people.

00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:24.915
And I don't judge you for it.

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:26.250
We survived the only
way we knew how.

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:29.212
But there were other ways.

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:32.339
We just weren't any good at 'em.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.799
If you knew the shit
that I've been through,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.759
Tommy, tryin' to find you
these last few months...

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.762
I'm gonna be a father.

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:40.724
Maria's a few months along now.

00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:44.227
So I just gotta be more careful.

00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:51.901
To be honest,
I'm scared to death.

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:58.533
But I don't know. Uh... I
feel like I'd be a good dad.

00:27:04.539 --> 00:27:06.041
Guess we'll find out.

00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:11.712
"I guess we'll find out"?

00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:15.008
- That's all you got?
- What else am I supposed to say?

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:21.598
Just because life
stopped for you...

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:25.560
doesn't mean it
has to stop for me.

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:33.108
We'll grab some supplies

00:27:33.109 --> 00:27:35.236
and be outta your
hair in the mornin'.

Hello?

00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:04.511
Maria?

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:41.296
Oh, good.

00:30:41.297 --> 00:30:43.758
Just traded for this.
Go ahead, try it on.

00:30:50.765 --> 00:30:52.599
It's, uh, super fuckin' purple.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.601
- Eggplant. It fits?
- Yeah.

00:30:54.602 --> 00:30:57.104
- Shoes aren't too big?
- Uh, no.

00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:59.523
- Where's my other stuff?
- Rag pile.

00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:01.275
- Did you get the thing I left you?
- Yeah.

00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:03.986
- Weirdest gift ever.
- But useful.

00:31:03.987 --> 00:31:07.655
- Who's been cutting your hair?
- Uh, world-class salons.

00:31:08.256 --> 00:31:10.052
- Let me get my scissors.
- Oh, whoa, no. I'm...

00:31:10.077 --> 00:31:13.478
Trim. That's all. Just
the ends, I promise.

00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:20.002
So, this was, like, your job
back then or something?

00:31:20.003 --> 00:31:22.671
No, I was an Assistant
District Attorney

00:31:22.672 --> 00:31:23.881
out of Omaha, Nebraska.

00:31:26.092 --> 00:31:29.928
- I put bad guys in jail.
- Oh... Cool, I guess.

00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:32.055
I always liked
doing hair, though.

00:31:32.056 --> 00:31:34.808
Maybe it was a mom thing.

00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:36.977
You were looking at the
little memorial Tommy made?

00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:40.022
Uh, yeah.

00:31:40.023 --> 00:31:43.567
- I'm-I'm sorry about your kids.
- It's okay.

00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:45.902
And kid. Just Kevin.

00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:48.064
Sarah was Joel's daughter.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:56.205
- Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, it's okay.

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:01.209
I guess that explains
him a little.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.128
Look, I'm not gonna ask you
what you're doing with him.

00:32:03.129 --> 00:32:05.672
- Good.
- But there are clearly things you don't know about Joel.

00:32:05.673 --> 00:32:08.718
Oh, like how he used to kill people?
I know about that.

00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:13.055
- So then you understand my concern.
- He doesn't do that anymore.

00:32:13.056 --> 00:32:15.849
- He stopped killing people?
- Innocent ones.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.728
And Tommy did it, too.
Are you worried about him?

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.357
Tommy was following Joel.

00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:26.360
- The way you are now.
- Well, maybe I'm smarter than Tommy.

00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:27.653
No offense.

00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:29.905
You are definitely smart.

00:32:29.906 --> 00:32:32.158
Would've made
a hell of a lawyer.

00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:36.454
There's a whole lot
you're not telling me.

00:32:36.829 --> 00:32:38.122
Good.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.708
Therein lies the point.

00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:44.586
Be careful who you
put your faith in.

00:32:44.587 --> 00:32:48.257
The only people who can betray us...
are the ones we trust.

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:53.137
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

00:32:54.514 --> 00:32:55.681
Now, come on.

00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:58.934
Grab your super
fuckin' eggplant coat.

00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:01.479
- Where are we going?
- The movies.

00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:08.403
Elliot Garfield.
I'm moving into the other room.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.737
Yeah. I'm a friend of, uh,

00:33:10.738 --> 00:33:12.031
Tony's, you know,
Tony DeForrest.

00:33:14.367 --> 00:33:16.076
That's nice.

00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:18.245
I'm an actor, too.

00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:19.579
Yeah?

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.415
Well, your mother knows.

00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:24.334
I see.

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:25.753
Well...

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.797
guess I'll be seeing you around.

00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:31.551
- I guess so.
- Night.

00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:36.221
Just met Lucy.

00:33:36.222 --> 00:33:37.723
What did you tell her?

00:33:37.724 --> 00:33:39.015
That I was moving
into the other room.

00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:40.727
She seemed to take it in stride.

00:33:58.327 --> 00:33:59.996
The guys said
I might find you here.

00:34:03.374 --> 00:34:05.251
Figured I'd save
you the trouble.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.429
I shouldn't have
said what I said.

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:19.640
I don't even believe it.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.603
I know you're happy for me.
It just...

00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:26.606
It's complicated for you...

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.608
and I'm sorry.

00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:33.653
So you gonna let me
off the hook, or what?

00:34:33.654 --> 00:34:36.699
This ride to the University,
is it a suicide mission?

00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:38.408
No.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.994
It's dangerous, but it's
nothin' you can't handle.

00:34:40.995 --> 00:34:42.329
Just prepare and do what you do.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.372
You've had people go
that way and come back?

00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:45.792
All of 'em.

00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:47.970
What is this?

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.673
She's immune.

00:34:54.716 --> 00:34:57.177
- What?
- Ellie.

00:34:57.178 --> 00:34:59.055
She got infected,
but she didn't get sick.

00:35:00.097 --> 00:35:01.848
Tommy.

00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:05.060
Tommy, I saw her get bit myself.

00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:07.271
That was months ago. Months.

00:35:08.147 --> 00:35:09.732
She's immune.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.505
From the beginning.

00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:37.050
It was Marlene.

00:35:37.051 --> 00:35:39.469
She hired us to smuggle her
to some Fireflies.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.889
It went bad.

00:35:42.431 --> 00:35:45.225
Tess got bit.

00:35:45.226 --> 00:35:47.228
She made me swear
to take the kid.

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:49.647
It was her dyin' wish.

00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:51.107
What the hell was
I supposed to do?

00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:57.153
We made it as far
as K.C., and then...

00:35:57.154 --> 00:35:59.739
You know, she saved
my life there...

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.492
from another kid.

00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:05.328
Five years ago,
I would've destroyed him.

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:08.081
But she had to shoot
him to save me.

00:36:08.082 --> 00:36:10.250
14 years old.

00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:14.130
Because I was too slow and too
fuckin' deaf to hear him comin'.

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.301
And I saw...

00:36:20.052 --> 00:36:22.971
I saw a man kill
his own brother...

00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:27.434
to save her,
while I just watched.

00:36:27.435 --> 00:36:29.352
And today, I thought that dog
was gonna tear her apart

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:32.105
because it smelled
somethin' on her.

00:36:32.106 --> 00:36:33.316
And all I did was stand there.

00:36:34.942 --> 00:36:38.069
I couldn't... move.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.870
I couldn't think of anything to say.
I just...

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.493
I was so afraid.

00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:50.625
You think I can
still handle things, but...

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.127
I'm not who I was.

00:36:54.128 --> 00:36:55.921
I'm weak.

00:36:55.922 --> 00:36:57.297
Lately, there are these moments

00:36:57.298 --> 00:36:59.842
where the fear
comes up outta nowhere, and...

00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:02.427
my heart...

00:37:02.428 --> 00:37:04.347
feels like it's stopped.

00:37:09.477 --> 00:37:10.728
And I have dreams.

00:37:13.439 --> 00:37:15.023
Every night.

00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:16.983
What kinda dreams?

00:37:16.984 --> 00:37:20.529
I don't know. I can't remember.

00:37:21.614 --> 00:37:23.282
I just know that
when I wake up...

00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:28.871
I've lost somethin'.

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:32.416
I'm failin' in my sleep.

00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:35.460
That's all I do.

00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:36.989
It's all I've ever done

00:37:37.414 --> 00:37:38.906
is fail her

00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:42.634
again and again.

00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:43.802
You want me to take her.

00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:45.071
I'm just gonna get her killed.

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:46.981
I know it. I know it.

00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:49.183
I have to leave her.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.019
Joel.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.397
I mean, it's why you
took off on me, right?

00:37:55.398 --> 00:37:57.650
To make up
for the things we did?

00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:01.444
Well, here's your chance

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:03.780
to bring your kid
into a better world.

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.490
You're younger than me.
You're still strong.

00:38:05.491 --> 00:38:07.166
You said it yourself, you'll come back.

00:38:07.867 --> 00:38:09.578
You have to take her.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.295
And you can't tell
anyone, not even Maria.

00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:21.881
Tommy, you're
the only one I trust.

00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:22.882
If anyone else sees
those bites on her,

00:38:22.883 --> 00:38:24.676
what's under her skin...

00:38:25.377 --> 00:38:26.545
they'll shoot her.

00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:31.525
It's the last thing
I'll ever ask of you.

00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:35.439
I swear.

00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:51.412
I'll take her out at dawn.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.972
We got you in 38.
It's left, left, right.

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:25.445
I have a feeling
you'd rather be alone, Luce.

00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:28.239
He'll know we thought it was
lousy if we don't say hello.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.116
All right.
But try and be tactful.

00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:32.578
- What's tactful?
- Lie.

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:36.790
Hello?

00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:39.794
Mr. Garfield? It's Lucy and me.

00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:44.964
We, uh, we just came back to
tell you how much we enjoyed it.

00:39:44.965 --> 00:39:46.716
I had the best time.

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:48.397
At first, I thought it
was gonna be boring.

00:40:07.988 --> 00:40:09.031
Ellie?

00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:21.210
Is this really all they had
to worry about?

00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:25.004
Boys. Movies.

00:40:25.005 --> 00:40:27.550
Deciding which shirt
goes with which skirt.

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:29.385
It's bizarre.

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:37.392
- Listen, um...
- Why are you here?

00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:39.352
- I came here to talk to you.
- No, why are you still here?

00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:42.231
If you're gonna
ditch me, ditch me.

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.360
What exactly did you hear?

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:51.073
"I have to leave her.
You have to take her."

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:57.454
You know, I stood up for you
today because I thought...

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:05.587
I made this decision
for your own good.

00:41:05.588 --> 00:41:07.590
You'll be way
better off with Tommy.

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:10.133
He knows the area
better than I do...

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:12.218
- Do you give a shit about me or not?
- Of course, I do.

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:14.471
Then what are you so afraid of?

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:20.394
I'm not her, you know?

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.774
- Maria told me about Sarah and...
- Don't.

00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:31.697
Don't say another word.

00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:37.286
I-I'm sorry about
your daughter, Joel.

00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:40.247
But I have lost people, too.

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:43.158
You have no idea what loss is.

00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:47.253
Everybody I have cared for

00:41:47.254 --> 00:41:50.381
has either died or left me.

00:41:50.382 --> 00:41:53.218
Everybody,
fucking except for you!

00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:55.553
So don't tell me that I'd
be safer with somebody else

00:41:55.554 --> 00:41:56.721
because the truth is

00:41:56.722 --> 00:41:58.682
I would just be more scared.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.775
You're right.

00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:10.151
You're not my daughter.

00:42:10.152 --> 00:42:13.447
And I sure as hell
ain't your dad.

00:42:15.407 --> 00:42:17.034
Now, come dawn...

00:42:17.826 --> 00:42:20.329
we're goin' our separate ways.

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:55.758
Come in.

00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:18.364
Stables.

00:44:42.971 --> 00:44:46.140
- You came here to say goodbye or something?
- No.

00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:48.935
I came here to steal one
of these horses and go.

00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:50.103
I woulda gave you one.

00:44:50.104 --> 00:44:51.687
I know.

00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:53.940
Anyway...

00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:56.777
that was 30 minutes
ago, and I guess...

00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:00.822
you deserve a choice.

00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:02.407
I still think you'd be
better off with Tommy...

00:45:02.408 --> 00:45:04.450
Let's go.

00:45:04.451 --> 00:45:07.579
Okay.

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:28.225
Hold onto both.

00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:31.853
General direction?

00:45:31.854 --> 00:45:34.814
Head southeast
till you hit I-25.

00:45:34.815 --> 00:45:37.643
It's right off the interstate.
Shouldn't be hard to miss.

00:45:53.542 --> 00:45:56.336
There's a place for you here...
Both of you.

00:45:57.254 --> 00:46:00.299
Countin' on it.

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:05.595
Can I borrow that?

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:06.846
Yeah.

00:46:06.847 --> 00:46:08.530
'Cause Maria took
mine, you know?

00:46:08.555 --> 00:46:10.216
I already said yes, Joel.

00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:19.526
Adios, big brother.

00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:35.959
Close it up.

00:46:59.608 --> 00:47:01.400
Wide right.

00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:03.486
- You're flinchin'.
- The target's too small.

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:06.114
I made it bigger than I should've.
Eject the cartridge.

00:47:07.282 --> 00:47:08.574
And I am not flinching.

00:47:08.575 --> 00:47:12.203
- The rifle just sucks.
- Okay, give it.

00:47:12.204 --> 00:47:14.247
It doesn't aim right.

00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:16.415
- Mm-hmm.
- You'll see.

00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:19.085
A deep breath in,
slow breath out.

00:47:19.086 --> 00:47:21.336
You squeeze the trigger
like you love it.

00:47:22.037 --> 00:47:23.089
Gentle...

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:25.132
steady... nice and slow.

00:47:25.133 --> 00:47:26.933
You gonna shoot this thing
or get it pregnant?

00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:31.848
It isn't gonna work.
It doesn't aim right.

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:35.811
You dick.

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:01.043
So the way they
ran stuff in Jackson,

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:02.295
was how things used to be?

00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:03.629
No.

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:06.591
The country
was too big for that.

00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:09.010
Back then, there were basically two
main ways of lookin' at things.

00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:12.179
- Some people wanted to own everything.
- Mm-hmm.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.058
And some people didn't want
anyone to own anything at all.

00:48:16.351 --> 00:48:17.643
Which one were you?

00:48:17.644 --> 00:48:19.353
Neither. I just did my job.

00:48:19.354 --> 00:48:22.315
Which was... building?

00:48:22.316 --> 00:48:23.983
That's right.

00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:26.444
Houses, stores,
that kinda thing.

00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:28.655
We were called "contractors."

00:48:30.365 --> 00:48:32.492
"The Contractor."

00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:34.410
That's pretty cool.

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:38.331
Yeah. We were cool.

00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:40.583
Everybody loved contractors.

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:41.710
Nice.

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:56.015
Okay, so if you mess
up your fourth down,

00:48:56.016 --> 00:48:57.933
then you give the ball
to the other team?

00:48:57.934 --> 00:48:59.852
Right. It's called a "turnover."

00:48:59.853 --> 00:49:01.646
Turnover.

00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:03.564
But if you make it to 10 yards,

00:49:03.565 --> 00:49:06.359
then you're back to first down?

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.027
Yep.

00:49:08.028 --> 00:49:12.239
So, basically just
moving in one direction.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.283
Basically...

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:18.996
- but violent.
- Oh, well. There's that.

00:49:18.997 --> 00:49:22.041
Well, how 'bout that?
Made it in five days.

00:49:22.042 --> 00:49:25.711
Easy days. I don't know what
Tommy was so afraid of.

00:49:25.712 --> 00:49:26.879
Still time to find out.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.049
"Still time to find out."

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:33.553
"The Contractorrrr."

00:49:46.024 --> 00:49:49.402
Home of the Big Horns.
What does that mean?

00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:51.570
Team mascot.

00:49:51.571 --> 00:49:53.072
It's a kind of sheep.

00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:54.240
Oh, see?

00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:56.742
One step closer to your dream.

00:49:56.743 --> 00:49:58.160
Don't see any Fireflies, though.

00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:00.287
They're probably in the middle.

00:50:00.288 --> 00:50:02.749
- Safer.
- Uh-huh.

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:05.502
This way.

00:50:14.803 --> 00:50:17.012
So these places...

00:50:17.013 --> 00:50:18.764
people would live here
and, like, what?

00:50:18.765 --> 00:50:19.974
- Go to classes and stuff?
- Yup.

00:50:19.975 --> 00:50:24.103
- Even though they were adults.
- Sort of adults.

00:50:24.104 --> 00:50:25.813
I think it was just
as much about partying

00:50:25.814 --> 00:50:29.108
and findin' themselves
as anythin' else.

00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:31.318
Figuring out what they wanted
to do with their lives.

00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:33.947
What they wanted
to do with their lives.

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:38.451
- So I've been thinkin'.
- Mm-hmm?

00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:41.287
I don't want a sheep ranch, actually.
I mean, if the deal is I can do anything?

00:50:41.288 --> 00:50:42.830
That's the deal.

00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:44.206
Well...

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:46.125
when I was a kid,
I wanted to be a singer.

00:50:46.126 --> 00:50:47.836
Shut up.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.796
Why is that funny?

00:50:50.797 --> 00:50:52.256
- You gotta sing something now.
- No.

00:50:52.257 --> 00:50:54.550
- Come on, man. I'm not gonna laugh.
- You're already laughin'.

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:57.636
Yeah, okay, true.

00:50:57.637 --> 00:50:58.971
Well, you're singin'
for me later.

00:50:58.972 --> 00:51:01.307
I'm gonna save
the fuckin' world, man.

00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:03.268
It's the least
you can do for me.

00:51:05.228 --> 00:51:06.605
Fair enough.

00:51:12.527 --> 00:51:14.487
Are those monkeys?

00:51:14.488 --> 00:51:16.113
Must be from the old labs.

00:51:16.114 --> 00:51:18.491
Look at them go.

00:51:18.492 --> 00:51:20.034
First time seein' a monkey?

00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:21.995
First time seein' a monkey.

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:27.918
Lookit.

00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:34.090
Here we go.

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:42.057
- Guard stations.
- Mm. No guards.

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:45.351
- Uh...
- Yeah.

00:51:45.352 --> 00:51:46.478
Gun?

00:51:48.104 --> 00:51:49.272
Yeah.

00:52:52.878 --> 00:52:54.504
There were definitely
doctors here.

00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:06.307
This is a packing list.

00:53:06.308 --> 00:53:08.601
Somethin' you
make before moving.

00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:11.146
They just left?

00:53:13.356 --> 00:53:14.983
Maybe not all of them.

00:54:01.154 --> 00:54:03.822
Well... at least
it ain't Clickers.

00:54:04.823 --> 00:54:06.993
Yeah, no Fireflies either.

00:54:07.494 --> 00:54:08.786
Maybe in all that research,

00:54:08.787 --> 00:54:10.789
they turned into
fuckin' monkeys.

00:54:27.889 --> 00:54:29.598
That's where they went?

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:31.350
All the pins lead there.

00:54:31.351 --> 00:54:33.268
Maybe gettin' ahead
of the weather...

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:36.021
better facilities? I don't know.

00:54:36.022 --> 00:54:38.400
- This way.
- Shut the fuck up.

00:54:53.915 --> 00:54:55.250
Out the back.

00:55:16.021 --> 00:55:17.647
- Ready?
- Yeah.

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:27.490
Come here. Come here.
Come here. I got ya.

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:30.952
Joel!

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.114
Joel! Get on the horse!

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:11.075
Get on the horse.

00:56:11.076 --> 00:56:13.369
Joel!

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.540
Get him!

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:20.793
Go!

00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:22.544
Get back!

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:25.089
Shit!

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:27.092
You motherfucker!

00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:36.976
They're not following us.
I think we're safe.

00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:40.604
Joel?

00:56:40.605 --> 00:56:42.189
Joel, no, no, no! Shit!

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:44.608
Fuck!

00:56:44.609 --> 00:56:45.944
Joel?

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:47.612
Joel?

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:50.365
Shit.

00:56:51.658 --> 00:56:52.892
Joel, open your eyes.

00:56:53.493 --> 00:56:55.829
Open your eyes.
Joel, you gotta get up.

00:56:58.414 --> 00:57:00.707
I can't fuckin' do this
without you.

00:57:00.708 --> 00:57:02.334
I don't know where
the fuck I'm going,

00:57:02.335 --> 00:57:03.920
what the fuck I'm gonna do.

00:57:04.295 --> 00:57:05.922
Joel.

00:57:11.803 --> 00:57:13.138
Please.

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:16.516
