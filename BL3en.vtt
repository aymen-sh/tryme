05:14.140 --> 05:15.540
<b><i>This guy...</i></b>

05:15.540 --> 05:18.870

05:25.410 --> 05:26.720

05:27.450 --> 05:29.260
<b><i>I'll use Nanase as a distraction...</i></b>

05:32.390 --> 05:33.560
<b>That way, huh?</b>

05:33.560 --> 05:35.670
<b><i>Shut up. And back again!</i></b>

05:35.670 --> 05:37.730

05:38.120 --> 05:39.190

05:39.810 --> 05:41.150
<b><i>...onto the through pass!</i></b>

05:43.880 --> 05:45.070
<b><i>I got the better of him.</i></b>

05:45.790 --> 05:50.030
<b><i>I can see it. The picture's expanding. 
I can see my way to the goal.</i></b>

05:50.720 --> 05:53.130
<b><i>I'm a bit too far out to shoot.</i></b>

05:53.130 --> 05:54.500

<b><i>If I can hit a pinpoint pass, he can score.</i></b>

06:00.630 --> 06:04.760

06:05.190 --> 06:06.730
<b>Isagi Yoichi!</b>

06:07.040 --> 06:08.350
<b><i>Shidou?</i></b>

06:10.980 --> 06:12.110
<b><i>Oh, I see.</i></b>

06:12.670 --> 06:18.440
<b><i>A one-two will get me past Chigiri and into 
an area to shoot. It's some good old box play.</i></b>

06:19.050 --> 06:21.150
<b><i>Okay. Get ready, Shidou.</i></b>

06:21.600 --> 06:24.440
<b><i>This is our chemical reaction!</i></b>

06:24.440 --> 06:26.280
<b>Nice assist.</b>

06:26.610 --> 06:27.150
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

06:29.420 --> 06:31.370
<b><i>He pivoted on the spot?</i></b>

06:33.390 --> 06:34.960
<b>Ta-da!</b>

06:37.890 --> 06:40.790
<b><i>A spinning banana shot?</i></b>

06:45.210 --> 06:50.080
<b><i>With his strong core and 
superfast shooting motion,</i></b>

06:51.080 --> 06:53.550
<b><i>he's basically invincible 
inside the penalty area.</i></b>

06:53.550 --> 06:56.810
<b>I am the strongest in the box.</b>

06:57.950 --> 07:01.090
<b><i>I was a fool to expect him
 to pass it to me.</i></b>

07:01.480 --> 07:03.970
<b>Wow. Bro's a beast.</b>

07:05.580 --> 07:12.300
<b><i>Still, because he was nearby, I had more 
options and that goal became possible.</i></b>

07:13.150 --> 07:15.440
<b>Isagi-san, ya got one assist now, bro.</b>

07:18.830 --> 07:20.410
<b>Thanks, Nanase.</b>

07:21.430 --> 07:22.540
<b>No sweat.</b>

07:22.800 --> 07:25.890
<b>You're the only guy I can keep up with.</b>

07:25.890 --> 07:27.500
<b>So feel free to use me more, bro.</b>

07:28.290 --> 07:30.870
<b><i>I'm starting to discover new play styles.</i></b>

07:31.320 --> 07:33.340
<b><i>And I'm more involved in the game now.</i></b>

<b>Yeah, let's do this.</b>

07:39.280 --> 07:41.600
<b><i>All that's left is for me to score!</i></b>

07:42.000 --> 07:45.300
<b><i>Isagi Yoichi's startin' to function.</i></b>

07:45.300 --> 07:47.070
<b><i>What a pain.</i></b>

07:47.690 --> 07:50.780
<b><i>If he scores, it's over. 
I have to get the ball!</i></b>

07:51.470 --> 07:56.580
<b><i>I'll blast past you again and 
finish this match, Mr. Average.</i></b>

07:58.850 --> 08:00.790
<b>You're in way over your head, Isagi.</b>

08:01.610 --> 08:04.950
<b>Do you only target players weaker
 than you, Karasu, you hyena?</b>

08:05.360 --> 08:07.670
<b>Leave the dead body alone
 and come at me.</b>

08:07.670 --> 08:13.380
<b>I hate that "Big G" bullying attitude.
 I'll sue ya for power harassment, dumdum.</b>

08:13.940 --> 08:14.970
<b><i>These two...</i></b>

08:15.930 --> 08:18.180
<b><i>are completely disregarding me!</i></b>

08:27.960 --> 08:32.360
<b><i>He wrecked my sense of distance by raisin' his 
elbow at the right moment to deflect my hand?</i></b>

08:32.360 --> 08:35.000
<b><i>Impressive, Itoshi Rin.</i></b>

08:35.370 --> 08:38.950
<b><i>In that case, I'll give up on 
gettin' past him and just pass it off.</i></b>

08:38.950 --> 08:41.370
<b><i>I'll take a step back to 
keep hold of the ball andâ€”</i></b>

08:43.850 --> 08:45.870
<b>Mr. Average? You were in my blind spot?</b>

08:46.640 --> 08:48.090
<b><i>Good. I've stolen it!</i></b>

08:48.090 --> 08:49.590
<b>Nice, Isagi-san!</b>

08:49.590 --> 08:51.090
<b>I'm ready over here!</b>

08:51.640 --> 08:54.800
<b><i>Nanase and Hiori are 
reacting to my movements.</i></b>

08:55.570 --> 08:57.010
<b><i>It's time to counterattack.</i></b>

08:58.100 --> 09:00.780
<b>'Sup. Road's closed.</b>

09:00.780 --> 09:03.070
<b><i>Otoya gets back so fast.</i></b>

09:03.070 --> 09:03.770
<b><i>But...</i></b>

09:04.110 --> 09:05.020
<b>Isagi-san!</b>

09:06.600 --> 09:07.750
<b><i>Are you ready?</i></b>

09:09.200 --> 09:11.400
<b><i>Nanase follows and supports me,</i></b>

09:12.860 --> 09:15.540
<b><i>while Hiori makes chances
 with his passing sense.</i></b>

09:15.910 --> 09:18.060
<b><i>Before the other team can regroup,</i></b>

09:19.890 --> 09:22.080
<b><i>we'll dominate the midfield!</i></b>

09:22.530 --> 09:24.410
<b>Whoa! Almost missed it!</b>

09:24.410 --> 09:27.150
<b><i>It's not like he's super good, but...</i></b>

09:27.150 --> 09:28.130
<b>Gimme, Nanase!</b>

09:28.130 --> 09:29.080
<b>Here!</b>

09:29.890 --> 09:32.340
<b><i>But if I switch the play 
to the other side now...</i></b>

09:33.810 --> 09:35.510
<b><i>Hiori will be free!</i></b>

09:35.750 --> 09:37.970
<b>Nice, nice.</b>

09:39.180 --> 09:42.200
<b>Eyes forward, Light Blue.</b>

09:42.600 --> 09:47.440
<b>Yer stupidly fast, aintcha? 
Ain't no wonder Karasu likes ya.</b>

09:48.730 --> 09:50.930
<b><i>Before Chigiri can close him down,</i></b>

09:50.930 --> 09:54.790
<b><i>Hiori will either take a shot 
or look to offload the ball.</i></b>

09:54.790 --> 09:56.280
<b><i>And Shidou's over there.</i></b>

09:56.280 --> 09:58.610
<b>One reserved seat in front of the goal!</b>

09:58.840 --> 10:03.340
<b><i>Like earlier, Shidou will move
toward Hiori to get the ball.</i></b>

10:03.700 --> 10:07.570
<b><i>Behind him, a space will open up 
for about a second at most.</i></b>

10:09.390 --> 10:15.050
<b><i>That's my area to shoot from
that'll allow me to subjugate Shidou.</i></b>

10:15.470 --> 10:16.510
<b>You ready?</b>

10:17.720 --> 10:19.430
<b>Oh, you're ignoring me?</b>

10:21.460 --> 10:24.070
<b><i>Here it comes! A perfectly shared vision!</i></b>

10:24.070 --> 10:25.640
<b><i>Beautiful, Hiori!</i></b>

10:27.030 --> 10:28.920
<b><i>The final piece...</i></b>

10:31.980 --> 10:33.520
<b><i>is right here!</i></b>

10:37.360 --> 10:39.990
<b><i>Shit! One step short!</i></b>

10:41.250 --> 10:42.500
<b><i>I could see it.</i></b>

10:42.910 --> 10:44.370
<b><i>I understood it.</i></b>

10:45.520 --> 10:47.670
<b><i>But my physical abilities...</i></b>

10:48.670 --> 10:50.040

10:50.660 --> 10:51.500

10:51.800 --> 10:52.710
<b>I'll clear that.</b>

10:52.710 --> 10:53.750

10:54.250 --> 10:55.340
<b>Loose ball!</b>

10:56.720 --> 10:58.550
<b>Rin and Karasu incoming!</b>

10:58.550 --> 11:01.510
<b>This is why a not-so-average
 opponent is a pain.</b>

11:01.510 --> 11:04.220
<b>Then, get out of my way, you craven crow.</b>

11:04.220 --> 11:04.900
<b>Stop him!</b>

11:04.900 --> 11:05.510
<b>Shoot!</b>

11:06.590 --> 11:08.210
<b><i>Rin will make it.</i></b>

11:09.050 --> 11:11.650
<b><i>That last step I can't reach...</i></b>

11:12.760 --> 11:14.400
<b><i>He'll reach it.</i></b>

11:25.760 --> 11:29.250
<b>Ya grabbed me to steady yerself

11:29.250 --> 11:30.960
<b>Smart, Mr. Not-So-Average.</b>

11:31.670 --> 11:34.920
<b>Hmph. You're one chatty crow.</b>

11:35.830 --> 11:42.210
<b><i>Ever since Mr. Average activated, 
y'all are a totally different team.</i></b>

11:42.960 --> 11:44.850
<b><i>That's annoying.</i></b>

11:45.610 --> 11:52.520
<b><i>We're able to assert ourselves
and coexist with Rin and Shidou as a team.</i></b>

11:53.690 --> 11:54.480

11:55.520 --> 11:57.330

<b>Isagi-kun, you were so close.</b>

12:14.570 --> 12:17.040
<b>Oh, Hirori. That was a nice pass.</b>

12:17.330 --> 12:20.660
<b>In that moment, that was 
the only spot I could place it.</b>

12:20.660 --> 12:21.700
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

12:22.120 --> 12:25.140
<b>No, the pass was perfect.</b>

12:25.790 --> 12:28.140
<b>My analysis and vision were spot on.</b>

12:28.450 --> 12:32.550
<b>But... Damn it. My physical 
abilities weren't good enough.</b>

12:33.500 --> 12:37.690
<b>My mind's catching up, but my body isn't.</b>

12:40.650 --> 12:44.110
<b>If yer thinkin' <i>then</i> movin',

<b>See it. Think about it. Move.</b>

12:49.030 --> 12:52.540
<b>Up to now, that process

12:59.220 --> 13:01.360
<b>Ya don't have their physical abilities,</b>
