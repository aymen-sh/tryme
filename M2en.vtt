01:34.820 --> 01:36.450
<b>Mr. Wahlberg.</b>

01:37.950 --> 01:40.700
<b>Why did you call for all of us?</b>

01:41.240 --> 01:46.620
<b>Hiding the fact he's a Lackmagic and attending
Easton Academy is out of the question.</b>

01:47.120 --> 01:48.960
<b>There's no need for an inquiry.</b>

01:49.380 --> 01:53.090
<b>We need to abide by the rules
and give this boy the maximum penalty.</b>

01:53.710 --> 01:59.840
<b>Divine Visionaries, might I ask you
to defer his sentencing?</b>

02:00.090 --> 02:04.970
<b>This is the first time
Innocent Zero sent a messenger.</b>

02:05.220 --> 02:10.480
<b>There is a high chance this boy
will give us a lead on them.</b>

02:12.310 --> 02:15.730
<b>We can't afford
to lose him at this juncture.</b>

02:21.160 --> 02:25.330
<b>Huh? The headmaster
seems really important.</b>

02:25.450 --> 02:26.750
<b>You know...</b>

02:26.750 --> 02:29.370
<b>Mr. Wahlberg is a previous Divine Visionary.</b>

02:30.120 --> 02:35.170
<b>He's a living legend, the only one to go
toe-to-toe against Innocent Zero in his youth.</b>

02:35.590 --> 02:40.590
<b>And the only one that I,
the next top dog of the world, respect.</b>

02:40.590 --> 02:43.680
<b>He's a man among magic users.</b>

02:44.140 --> 02:45.680
<b>Listen closely.</b>

02:46.100 --> 02:47.140
<b>'Kay.</b>

02:48.640 --> 02:52.690
<b>Mr. Wahlberg, I understand your position.</b>

02:53.860 --> 02:56.230
<b>But I cannot accept it.</b>

02:57.230 --> 02:59.650
<b>Regulations exist to maintain order.</b>

03:00.110 --> 03:02.990
<b>Lackmagic should be purged.</b>

03:03.530 --> 03:05.450
<b>That's just the way...</b>

03:10.540 --> 03:12.540
<b>Mr. Wahlberg, please!</b>

03:13.380 --> 03:16.880
<b>It's true. He cannot use magic.</b>

03:16.880 --> 03:22.180
<b>He's a bit rough around the edges
and not too scholarly.</b>

03:22.640 --> 03:29.100
<b>However, he has an unusual gift
to sway people's hearts.</b>

03:29.850 --> 03:36.150
<b>I believe that people like him will change
how we perceive this world.</b>

03:36.900 --> 03:39.570
<b>Of course, that is not all.</b>

03:39.860 --> 03:44.570
<b>Until now, those without magic
have been treated as inferior.</b>

03:45.320 --> 03:50.700
<b>But I take some issue
with that unjust treatment.</b>

03:51.120 --> 03:55.670
<b>Our values change alongside history.</b>

03:56.090 --> 04:00.920
<b>However, redefining our values
takes courage</b>

04:01.220 --> 04:05.640
<b>as we must admit
our injustices thus far.</b>

04:06.350 --> 04:08.260
<b>That said...</b>

04:08.760 --> 04:13.270
<b>What is wrong is still wrong.</b>

04:14.310 --> 04:16.110
<b>Mr. Wahlberg.</b>

04:16.190 --> 04:22.070
<b>I respect your position, but ignoring rules
and forcing your opinion...</b>

04:23.240 --> 04:25.240
<b>I ask of you as well.</b>

04:25.780 --> 04:27.450
<b>Rayne, even you?</b>

04:28.530 --> 04:31.580
<b>I do agree with the headmaster's opinion,</b>

04:32.080 --> 04:36.580
<b>but Mash Burnedead has also
proven himself worthy of our trust.</b>

04:37.380 --> 04:39.170
<b>Including my trust.</b>

04:42.510 --> 04:45.430
<b><i>So you like rabbits?</i></b>

04:45.630 --> 04:47.930
<b><i>No, not that.</i></b>

04:48.260 --> 04:51.310
<b>Rayne, I know what you're getting at.</b>

04:51.310 --> 04:53.930
<b>But sentimental opinions
shouldn't change regulations.</b>

04:53.930 --> 04:57.810
<b>What a pain. Follow the book
and get this over with.</b>

04:58.110 --> 05:01.530
<b>Mr. Wahlberg, you are quite right to say so.</b>

05:01.530 --> 05:04.280
<b>But the public won't allow
such an exception.</b>

05:05.360 --> 05:10.580
<b>There's nothing to reconsider.
Lackmagics need to be purged.</b>

05:11.120 --> 05:15.580
<b>You're letting emotions
take priority over rational thought.</b>

05:16.250 --> 05:20.380
<b>My thoughts align with yours.</b>

05:21.170 --> 05:26.800
<b>Our magical power
is a special gift from God.</b>

05:26.970 --> 05:32.100
<b>It's natural for those without it
to be excluded.</b>

05:32.520 --> 05:36.520
<b>That's because they aren't the same as us.</b>

05:36.520 --> 05:42.570
<b>However, one Lackmagic
just saved my life.</b>

05:42.820 --> 05:45.990
<b>I know that
I should be following regulations.</b>

05:46.860 --> 05:50.950
<b>If I am being remiss in my duties, so be it.</b>

05:50.950 --> 05:55.620
<b>But this case was mine to process.</b>

05:56.040 --> 06:01.670
<b>I would like you to defer
his sentencing if possible.</b>

06:02.040 --> 06:05.420
<b>You may punish me as you see fit.</b>

06:05.420 --> 06:09.130
<b>But I will not change my verdict.</b>

06:17.640 --> 06:19.560
<b>Only under these conditions.</b>

06:20.060 --> 06:27.070
<b>He will act only under our supervision
as a pawn against Innocent Zero.</b>

06:27.530 --> 06:32.700
<b>And he must prove he's strong enough
to fight Innocent Zero.</b>

06:33.870 --> 06:37.960
<b>That proof is to become this year's
Divine Visionary candidate.</b>

06:40.920 --> 06:44.040
<b>Should you fail,
you will be purged immediately.</b>

06:44.210 --> 06:45.960
<b>After all, it's only a deferment.</b>

06:47.170 --> 06:49.720
<b>All right. Understood.</b>

06:50.430 --> 06:55.470
<b>But to embody the headmaster's wishes
and for me to live in peace with everyone...</b>

06:56.520 --> 06:58.480
<b>That alone won't be enough.</b>

07:12.490 --> 07:16.040
<b>I will beat Innocent Gyro up.</b>

07:16.910 --> 07:18.290
<b>With my fist.</b>

07:30.670 --> 07:32.890
<b>And that's what happened.</b>

07:33.050 --> 07:35.050
<b>Innocent Zero.</b>

07:35.510 --> 07:39.060
<b>You have to go against
such a dangerous organization?</b>

07:39.060 --> 07:41.850
<b>So you can't use magic?</b>

07:41.850 --> 07:42.690
<b>Nope.</b>

07:43.480 --> 07:46.270
<b><i>Trying to win against me without magic?</i></b>

07:46.520 --> 07:48.900
<b>You really couldn't use magic.</b>

07:48.900 --> 07:49.780
<b>Nope.</b>

07:50.240 --> 07:52.910
<b>Gotcha. Then let's go out and have fun.</b>

07:53.780 --> 07:55.280
<b><i>Wait, what now?</i></b>

07:58.450 --> 08:00.830
<b>A sudden suggestion to go have fun.</b>

08:00.830 --> 08:04.420
<b>Maybe Dot was worried about Mash.</b>

08:04.710 --> 08:09.090
<b>They did defer the sentencing,
so this is probably better than sulking.</b>

08:09.300 --> 08:12.840
<b>But I wonder what kind of street clothes
everyone will wear.</b>

08:13.010 --> 08:14.220
<b>Here I am!</b>

08:14.640 --> 08:17.300
<b>KAKLANG</b>

08:15.760 --> 08:17.300
<b>Full-plate armor!?</b>

08:17.930 --> 08:20.810
<b>I mean, fun is basically a battle.</b>

08:21.020 --> 08:22.560
<b><i>What the heck does that mean?</i></b>

08:22.560 --> 08:24.100
<b>I'm here now.</b>

08:24.230 --> 08:26.020
<b>That must be Mash.</b>

08:25.310 --> 08:26.730
<b>RLL RLL</b>

08:26.980 --> 08:28.690
<b>He's in full workout mode!</b>

08:29.400 --> 08:33.650
<b>I've never gone out with friends before,
so I wasn't sure what to wear.</b>

08:33.650 --> 08:36.570
<b>But did you really need that ab wheel?</b>

08:36.870 --> 08:38.200
<b><i>My goodness.</i></b>

08:38.330 --> 08:41.830
<b><i>I really don't want to be seen
with these two.</i></b>

08:41.830 --> 08:43.250
<b>Sorry I'm late.</b>

08:46.750 --> 08:48.960
<b><i>I'm glad Lance is in normal...</i></b>

08:49.590 --> 08:51.210
<b>LITTLE SISTER LOVE</b>

08:49.920 --> 08:51.210
<b>- Love.
- Cringe!</b>

08:52.340 --> 08:54.470
<b>Did she just wink? And talk!?</b>

08:54.680 --> 08:58.140
<b>Yeah, come at me from anywhere!</b>

08:58.720 --> 09:01.270
<b>Dear sister, you're cute today, too.</b>

09:02.430 --> 09:05.230
<b><i>This group is just so detestable!</i></b>

09:08.440 --> 09:13.110
<b>There's a famous game you can play
only here in Marchétte Street.</b>

09:13.530 --> 09:14.240
<b>See, over there.</b>

09:16.240 --> 09:18.320
<b>TICKLE TICKLE</b>

09:23.660 --> 09:30.790
<b>A tickle koala's snot hardens, so we play darts
by tickling its nose and making it sneeze.</b>

09:31.300 --> 09:33.550
<b>Oh! Sounds like fun.</b>

09:33.550 --> 09:34.800
<b>I'll try it.</b>

09:39.220 --> 09:40.180
<b>TICKLE TICKLE</b>

09:40.390 --> 09:43.930
<b>Well, it's hard for novices
to even hit the target.</b>

09:43.930 --> 09:44.810
<b>THUNK</b>

09:46.520 --> 09:48.190
<b>Sorry, Dot.</b>

09:48.600 --> 09:51.820
<b>Well, it's your first time.</b>

09:52.530 --> 09:54.570
<b>I'll show you how it's done.</b>

09:55.820 --> 09:58.070
<b>TICKLE TICKLE</b>

10:01.700 --> 10:02.830
<b>THUNK</b>

10:06.080 --> 10:07.790
<b>A flying arm bar?</b>

10:07.960 --> 10:11.630
<b>- All right! Fight's on, damn it!
- Let's go.</b>

10:12.500 --> 10:14.300
<b>- Let's go.
- Okay.</b>

10:16.550 --> 10:18.220
<b>A new wand?</b>

10:18.220 --> 10:21.930
<b>Yeah. I've been wanting
to try out a new wand.</b>

10:22.350 --> 10:27.560
<b>And lately, there are rumors that
the Divine Visionary Candidate Exam is near.</b>

10:30.060 --> 10:35.070
<b>Because of the Innocent Zero case,
the exam will be held earlier this year.</b>

10:35.230 --> 10:38.320
<b>But that works in our favor.</b>

10:39.570 --> 10:43.870
<b>Based on the coin count,
we're sure to be taking the selection exam.</b>

10:44.410 --> 10:48.540
<b>If we can pass that, the only thing left
is the final screening.</b>

10:49.000 --> 10:51.540
<b>Even though you can't use magic...</b>

10:51.880 --> 10:55.170
<b>For my sister's sake,
I'm not going to go easy on you.</b>

10:57.550 --> 10:58.670
<b>We're here.</b>

10:59.430 --> 11:00.470
<b>This is the place.</b>

11:19.110 --> 11:20.700
<b>Welcome.</b>

11:21.740 --> 11:23.780
<b>Easton kids, are ye?</b>

11:23.780 --> 11:25.080
<b>Oh, yes.</b>

11:26.660 --> 11:28.040
<b>So many different kinds.</b>

11:28.040 --> 11:31.210
<b>The wand shop is always nothing but hype!</b>

11:31.460 --> 11:33.830
<b>Maybe I should replace my wand, too.</b>

11:48.270 --> 11:49.850
<b>Wowee.</b>

11:49.850 --> 11:52.600
<b>Your magical power
summons a fitting wand.</b>

11:52.600 --> 11:55.690
<b>Wands are tools for releasing magical power.</b>

11:56.190 --> 12:00.240
<b>Basically extensions
of the magic users' bodies.</b>

12:00.400 --> 12:05.700
<b>A fitting wand can drastically improve
your magic too.</b>

12:06.160 --> 12:09.330
<b>I think my magical power went up
because of my classes thanks to my wand.</b>

12:09.540 --> 12:13.080
<b>That's why you need to periodically
gauge your magic and...</b>

12:18.590 --> 12:23.550
<b>It's better to choose a wand
that fits your current self.</b>

12:29.970 --> 12:31.430
<b>Impressive.</b>

12:31.430 --> 12:36.650
<b>Even among wands for double-liners,
that one is quite the item.</b>

12:37.770 --> 12:38.730
<b>Amazing.</b>

12:38.730 --> 12:39.900
<b>I don't like it!</b>

12:41.030 --> 12:43.490
<b>You're not gauging?</b>

12:43.490 --> 12:44.150
<b>Huh?</b>

12:44.360 --> 12:48.620
<b><i>Oh, no! Mash lacks magical power,
so no wand would react to him.</i></b>

12:48.620 --> 12:49.990
<b>Then, I guess...</b>

12:50.160 --> 12:51.160
<b><i>You're doing it?</i></b>

13:03.090 --> 13:06.300
<b>What's that wand? The one on the floor.</b>

13:07.600 --> 13:11.060
<b>RTTL RTTL RTTL</b>

13:09.100 --> 13:11.060
<b>Huh? Scary. What the...</b>

13:11.350 --> 13:16.690
<b>Oh, that? We've had that wand here
in this shop for ages.</b>

13:16.770 --> 13:21.190
<b>It's so heavy that nobody can ever lift it.</b>

13:21.860 --> 13:27.280
<b>It's said that elf water
springs up from beneath it,</b>

13:27.450 --> 13:33.250
<b>and magnificent wands
can be crafted using that water.</b>

13:34.410 --> 13:38.000
<b>But it's no more than a legend.</b>

13:38.420 --> 13:46.380
<b>No amount of muscle or magic has been able
to lift it for the past millennium.</b>

13:46.380 --> 13:48.840
<b>That's bad, old man!
Saying that to him would...</b>

13:48.840 --> 13:50.470
<b>You don't get it at all!</b>

13:51.760 --> 13:53.470
<b>What do you mean?</b>

13:56.440 --> 13:58.650
<b>H-Hey, what are you...</b>

14:04.570 --> 14:06.110
<b>Then, I'll take this one.</b>

14:12.790 --> 14:14.620
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

14:14.790 --> 14:16.910
<b>That wand is all yours.</b>

14:16.910 --> 14:17.870
<b>Yay.</b>

14:18.120 --> 14:19.420
<b>Freaky.</b>

14:19.670 --> 14:23.210
<b><i>In the end, Lance didn't buy a wand.</i></b>

14:23.590 --> 14:26.840
<b>I'm sorry, my chores
took longer than expected!</b>

14:26.840 --> 14:29.130
<b>I had some bamboo-siness to do!</b>

14:29.470 --> 14:31.680
<b>Lemon. Captain.</b>

14:32.600 --> 14:34.810
<b>All right! We're gonna play!</b>

14:50.280 --> 14:53.330
<b>We're living our best student lives!</b>

14:55.080 --> 14:56.200
<b>That was fun.</b>

14:57.790 --> 15:01.330
<b>I've never gone out with friends before.</b>

15:02.710 --> 15:04.500
<b>Let's come back again sometime.</b>

15:05.250 --> 15:07.130
<b>- Yup.
- Damn straight!</b>

15:07.130 --> 15:08.340
<b>Let's come again!</b>

15:08.340 --> 15:09.970
<b>Next time with my sister, too.</b>

15:09.970 --> 15:11.590
<b>Buh-Buh-Bamboo!</b>

15:15.310 --> 15:17.850
<b><i>And several days passed.</i></b>

15:18.600 --> 15:22.350
<b>Gold coin count, one, two, three...</b>

15:23.190 --> 15:24.480
<b>Seven.</b>

15:25.400 --> 15:29.820
<b>Preparation for the selection exam
is as good as done.</b>

15:30.070 --> 15:31.530
<b>It's finally time.</b>

15:33.280 --> 15:34.490
<b>But first...</b>

15:35.530 --> 15:37.660
<b>You're going to visit home?</b>

15:38.410 --> 15:42.000
<b>Now? Right before the selection exam?</b>

15:42.630 --> 15:44.380
<b>Are you serious?</b>

15:44.840 --> 15:48.630
<b>I'm sorry. I-I-I will stay.</b>

15:50.420 --> 15:53.010
<b>Well, I think I'll go back home.</b>

15:53.340 --> 15:56.010
<b><i>Wait, what was that flashback just now?</i></b>

15:58.520 --> 16:01.850
<b>Someone lacking magic
wants to be a Divine Visionary.</b>

16:01.850 --> 16:03.440
<b>This is unprecedented.</b>

16:03.900 --> 16:06.860
<b>Headmaster Wahlberg is getting on in years.</b>

16:07.270 --> 16:09.990
<b>He can no longer make rational decisions.</b>

16:10.860 --> 16:16.700
<b>Those in power have a responsibility
to stop disturbances before they arise.</b>

16:17.240 --> 16:20.000
<b>So, I have to do something about this.</b>

16:21.160 --> 16:23.370
<b>Let me be clear.</b>

16:24.080 --> 16:29.420
<b>See that he cannot participate
in the Divine Visionary Candidate Exam.</b>

16:30.300 --> 16:34.720
<b>Orca dorm prefect, Margarette Macaron.</b>

16:35.430 --> 16:41.060
<b>Ortie, it's unusual
that you'd ask me for a favor.</b>

16:41.310 --> 16:47.270
<b>But you know I don't march
to the beat of just anyone's drum.</b>

16:48.610 --> 16:52.570
<b>I only care about one thing.</b>

16:54.950 --> 16:56.570
<b>Stimulation.</b>

16:57.620 --> 17:00.330
<b>There should be no lack of that.</b>

17:00.660 --> 17:05.580
<b>Mash Burnedead
bested Lang's prefect, Abel.</b>

17:05.790 --> 17:11.340
<b>Abel the coin seeker, you say?
Hmph, that's not bad.</b>

17:11.670 --> 17:14.880
<b>But simply hoarding coins
doesn't measure stren—</b>

17:14.880 --> 17:16.970
<b>He did it without magic.</b>

17:19.720 --> 17:22.680
<b>Leave the cleanup to me.</b>

17:23.770 --> 17:25.350
<b>Go wild.</b>

18:33.000 --> 18:35.840
<b>Spring has arrived.</b>

18:36.670 --> 18:38.930
<b><i>So creepy.</i></b>

18:39.800 --> 18:42.470
<b>Oh, Mash!</b>

18:42.470 --> 18:45.180
<b>I'm glad you made it back here, Mash!</b>

18:45.180 --> 18:46.930
<b>I'm somehow surviving.</b>

18:48.810 --> 18:50.860
<b>You hanging in there?</b>

18:50.860 --> 18:54.440
<b>Y-Yes. E-Easy peasy.</b>

18:54.440 --> 18:56.400
<b>R-Really?</b>

18:57.110 --> 18:58.650
<b>Excuse us!</b>

18:59.030 --> 19:00.530
<b>Huh? No way.</b>

19:01.070 --> 19:02.950
<b>You can't be...</b>

19:03.160 --> 19:07.710
<b>What? Mash's friends?</b>

19:08.290 --> 19:11.960
<b>I'm so touched.
To think Mash has made friends...</b>

19:12.750 --> 19:17.210
<b>Because I wasn't able to expose him
to the outside world,</b>

19:17.460 --> 19:19.970
<b>I didn't think this day would come.</b>

19:19.970 --> 19:22.930
<b>We're not such superficial things like friends.</b>

19:22.930 --> 19:23.720
<b>Huh?</b>

19:24.050 --> 19:26.220
<b>You use the word "rival"
and read it as "buddy."</b>

19:26.470 --> 19:28.430
<b>Though, I'm tougher than him.</b>

19:28.680 --> 19:30.060
<b><i>He's even got a rival.</i></b>

19:30.230 --> 19:32.270
<b>Father-in-law, it's nice to meet you.</b>

19:32.270 --> 19:37.570
<b>I give my regards for the future.
I am Mash's future wife.</b>

19:37.780 --> 19:39.820
<b>Even a fiancée!?</b>

19:39.950 --> 19:42.870
<b>We haven't even held hands,
so rest assured.</b>

19:44.280 --> 19:48.700
<b>Please be at ease.
Mash is doing well at school.</b>

19:49.910 --> 19:52.500
<b>This isn't much,
but please have some herbal tea.</b>

19:52.500 --> 19:53.710
<b>Oh, thank you.</b>

19:53.710 --> 19:56.170
<b>That's so not like you.</b>

19:56.460 --> 19:58.090
<b>I have something for you, too.</b>

19:59.130 --> 20:00.840
<b>- Please have some merch.
- Of who?</b>

20:00.970 --> 20:01.840
<b>My little sister.</b>

20:01.840 --> 20:03.010
<b>Why!?</b>

20:03.640 --> 20:07.640
<b>He doesn't understand that everyone
has different priorities.</b>

20:07.640 --> 20:09.350
<b>I-I see.</b>

20:14.060 --> 20:19.610
<b>They're quite unique. All of them.</b>

20:19.610 --> 20:21.280
<b>Yes, they are.</b>

20:21.860 --> 20:23.820
<b>You must have a hard time.</b>

20:23.820 --> 20:24.990
<b>Yes.</b>

20:25.780 --> 20:26.620
<b>But...</b>

20:28.540 --> 20:33.250
<b>I was never able to let Mash
go outside until now.</b>

20:33.960 --> 20:38.000
<b>I never dreamed he'd be surrounded
by such wonderful friends.</b>

20:40.630 --> 20:43.800
<b>I hope it lasts forever.</b>

20:45.430 --> 20:46.760
<b>I'm sure...</b>

20:47.220 --> 20:49.560
<b>I'm sure it will.</b>

20:53.020 --> 20:55.690
<b>Hope they won't mind us barging in.</b>

20:56.020 --> 20:59.150
<b>To defeat Abel
so soundly without magic.</b>

20:59.150 --> 21:01.990
<b>You think I can let
someone like that slide?</b>

21:02.650 --> 21:06.160
<b>Hey, what was that boy's name?</b>

21:06.370 --> 21:07.530
<b>Mash.</b>

21:07.530 --> 21:09.200
<b>It's Mash Burnedead.</b>

21:09.200 --> 21:12.200
<b>Right, right. Mash Burnedea—</b>

21:26.800 --> 21:28.050
<b>Dear me.</b>

21:28.390 --> 21:31.020
<b>You're playing his bodyguard now?</b>

21:31.020 --> 21:33.350
<b>I just happened to pass by.</b>

21:34.140 --> 21:38.270
<b>I heard a nasty-sounding laughter over here.</b>

21:39.230 --> 21:42.570
<b>Well, well. If it isn't the Sword Cane...</b>

21:42.780 --> 21:46.570
<b>Divine Visionary, Rayne Ames.</b>

21:47.360 --> 21:54.500
<b><i>Orca prefect Margarette Macaron's evil hands
approach by Orter Madl's order.</i></b>

21:54.960 --> 21:57.330
<b><i>But Mash is still oblivious of it. </i></b>

21:57.500 --> 21:59.840
<b>All right, let's play a board game!</b>

21:59.840 --> 22:01.420
<b>Yeah!</b>

22:01.420 --> 22:03.550
<b><i>He really didn't know.</i></b>
