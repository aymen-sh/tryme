00:05.550 --> 00:09.150
What's the matter, hero?

00:24.440 --> 00:25.760
M-Monster!

00:25.760 --> 00:30.670
Weren't you gonna give me 
my "just deserts"?

00:31.690 --> 00:34.510
Maybe you'd like a demonstration.

00:34.510 --> 00:36.510
W-Wait! Don't—

00:36.520 --> 00:38.760
N-No, sir! We need him <i>alive!</i>

<i>Three enemies of Aizu remain, 
and I'll capture them myself.</i>

02:34.440 --> 02:36.640
C-Culprit secured!

02:36.960 --> 02:38.600
I missed.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.880
Must be drunker than I thought.

02:47.240 --> 02:51.650
<i>Every opening he had vanished when
 he switched to a left-handed stance.</i>

02:54.860 --> 02:58.850
<i>That said, I can't just up 
and abandon a job.</i>

03:05.710 --> 03:07.080
You sure one's enough?

03:07.790 --> 03:10.180
This'll be over in one clash either way.

03:10.180 --> 03:12.320
Drawing both wouldn't make a difference.

03:15.630 --> 03:16.630
<i>I'll make it!</i>

03:25.410 --> 03:26.470
Kill me.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.670
Screwups die.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.280
That's shinobi law.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.090
"Shinobi law," my ass.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.290
You're not cut out for this.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.830
<i>No one came to our meeting spot.</i>

03:47.830 --> 03:51.040
<i>No pigeons bringing info, either,
 and the inn's staked out.</i>

03:51.540 --> 03:57.040
<i>Don't tell me they got Kyoshiro, 
Old Man Gonzo, and Rokuhei, too?</i>

03:57.590 --> 03:59.380
<i>Jutaro's been killed.</i>

03:59.870 --> 04:02.920
<i>I need to flee the city before—</i>

04:09.570 --> 04:14.520
Ah. The old man who served us tea
 mentioned a man missing his right eye.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.890
They found me!

04:17.360 --> 04:18.790
<i>But he's alone. Maybe I can...</i>

04:25.440 --> 04:27.750
There's no way in hell I can take that freak!

04:27.750 --> 04:29.070
Whoa there.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.240
That's as far as you go.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.920
What a letdown.

04:40.580 --> 04:44.670
I wish he'd at least had 
the spine to fight it out.

04:44.670 --> 04:48.550
Don't grumble, Soji. Few men amount to more.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.220
This is it for you.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.480
We're gonna make you pay 
for all the evil you've done.

05:00.090 --> 05:04.210
What'll it be? Cut him down
 and get it over with?

05:05.220 --> 05:09.440
<i>Wh-What's wrong with these guys?
 </i>These<i> are the Miburo?</i>

05:10.120 --> 05:11.860
You've got nowhere left to run.

05:11.860 --> 05:14.720
I wouldn't want any part 
of what you've got coming.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.450
They brought kids with them?!

05:17.760 --> 05:20.600
Surrender. You've lost.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.960
Ganging up on me's a dirty trick!

05:26.270 --> 05:30.010
Not one of you could beat me man-to-man!

05:30.460 --> 05:32.120
Pathetic.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.510
What was that?

05:33.750 --> 05:39.020
You won't even risk your life 
to stand by what you've done.

05:40.310 --> 05:44.840
And you expect me 
to believe all of <i>you</i> would?

05:44.840 --> 05:46.980
'Course we would.

05:49.540 --> 05:51.800
You wouldn't even best this pup.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.530
What?

05:56.090 --> 05:57.470
Gimme a break!

05:57.470 --> 05:59.970
Like I'd ever seriously duel a little kid—

05:59.970 --> 06:01.000
I'll fight you.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.990
If you don't mind.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.010
A wooden sword?

06:07.610 --> 06:10.580
What a riot! Wanna play swordsman, huh?

06:10.580 --> 06:11.760
I have a suggestion.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.560
If I win, you'll come with us quietly.

06:15.990 --> 06:19.990
If you win, we'll let you go.

06:21.230 --> 06:22.670
Are you serious?

06:22.670 --> 06:25.950
Your buddies will never go along with that.

06:26.150 --> 06:27.980
One bet on Nio to win.

06:27.980 --> 06:28.440
What?

06:28.610 --> 06:30.200
Make that two.

06:30.200 --> 06:30.970
I'm in.

06:30.970 --> 06:31.960
So am I.

06:33.740 --> 06:35.470
I've killed two men already.

06:35.910 --> 06:38.960
And I've only got a real sword. 
If you come at me...

06:39.260 --> 06:41.490
you'd better not whine when I kill you.

06:44.150 --> 06:45.070
Fine by me.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.600
You had me going for a second there, 
but you're all bark, no bite.

06:58.770 --> 07:00.550
<i>No. That wasn't bad.</i>

07:11.380 --> 07:13.650
<i>What's with this kid?</i>

07:15.980 --> 07:17.500
Whoa, wait a—

07:17.950 --> 07:20.840
You won't whine when 
I crack your skull, will you?

07:21.880 --> 07:23.500
W-Wait! Hold on!

07:28.810 --> 07:30.720
There. We've got you now.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.630
Culprit secured!

07:35.640 --> 07:41.000
<i>So they're all fearless? Even the kids?</i>

07:41.000 --> 07:42.640
Luck wasn't on your side.

07:43.080 --> 07:46.650
The city of Kyoto has the Miburo.

07:46.910 --> 07:48.840
Nicely done, Nio-kun!

07:48.840 --> 07:49.850
Splendid work.

07:49.850 --> 07:51.150
Th-Thank you.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.650
Y-You did it.

07:53.060 --> 07:54.650
You did it!

07:55.670 --> 08:00.910
Wait, did you go weak at the knees? 
After all that tough talk?

08:01.210 --> 08:05.160
He probably figured showing weakness 
would get him killed. That's just like him.

08:05.400 --> 08:10.000
No, I'm just not good enough 
to have won any other way.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.020
I-I don't believe you.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.000
By the way, how long are you 
gonna hold onto that sword?

08:15.620 --> 08:18.260
Oh, right. I'm so stiff that I can't let go.

08:19.350 --> 08:20.430
Kondo-san.

08:20.430 --> 08:22.400
You froze up because you're too tense.

08:25.670 --> 08:29.160
Um, why did you trust me, sir?

08:29.720 --> 08:33.090
You've done your sword swings every day.

08:33.820 --> 08:37.920
I set great store by spirit, attitude,
 and other things that can't be seen.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.400
But not today.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.920
I trusted these hands of yours.

08:43.140 --> 08:45.160
They prove you've been working hard.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.380
Keep at it.

08:52.380 --> 08:53.170
Yes, sir!

08:53.170 --> 08:54.680
That makes all of 'em!

08:53.700 --> 08:55.390
Taro, go buy some dried squid!

08:54.680 --> 08:56.920
Time to cut loose!

08:55.390 --> 08:57.170
As if any place is open now!

09:00.810 --> 09:05.190
<b>Commissioner of Kyoto
Lord Matsudaira Higo-no-Kami of Aizu
 Konkai-Komyoji Head Temple</b>

09:03.170 --> 09:03.880
They're here!

09:03.880 --> 09:05.180
What? Again?

09:05.580 --> 09:09.440
Right. They're all coming 
because they caught the last killer.

09:10.060 --> 09:11.410
I don't believe it.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.950
We've been hunting those men for 
three months with nothing to show for it,

09:16.390 --> 09:18.080
and it only took them two days?

09:24.310 --> 09:26.010
Working hard, I see.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.960
I'm so damn tired. 
Why's it gotta be up in the mountains?

09:32.960 --> 09:35.420
Hang in there, Taro-kun. We're almost there.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.210
What a wimp.

09:37.650 --> 09:39.020
<i>They have kids with them?</i>

09:43.230 --> 09:43.970
Fujita?

09:44.350 --> 09:46.980
Sorry. They beat you to it.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.060
Those are the Miburo.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.700
I commend you on your magnificent service.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.700
I am most pleased.

10:03.700 --> 10:04.700
Thank you, sir.

10:05.540 --> 10:07.610
<i>So this is the lord of Aizu.</i>

10:08.130 --> 10:09.800
Doesn't he seem a bit weird to you?

10:09.760 --> 10:10.790
Shh!

10:09.800 --> 10:10.790
Very.

10:11.140 --> 10:12.050
My lord.

10:12.050 --> 10:12.760
Right.

10:16.770 --> 10:20.210
I wish you to continue doing 
your utmost for the people.

10:21.380 --> 10:27.560
I promise to formally enlist the Mibu 
Roshigumi and provide further support.

10:30.270 --> 10:31.640
All right!

10:32.000 --> 10:33.720
Oh, happy day!

10:34.160 --> 10:36.840
M-Mind your manners! 
His Lordship is watching!

10:39.120 --> 10:40.280
Let them be.

10:40.870 --> 10:44.030
Still, you fellows must be awfully strong.

10:44.420 --> 10:48.280
To show you just how strong, 
let us demonstrate our swordsmanship.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.400
Hirama. Hirayama.

10:50.790 --> 10:51.540
Yes, sir.

10:56.970 --> 10:58.550
Why are you more excited than they are?

10:59.810 --> 11:01.100
All right, I'm ready.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.550
Let's do this.

11:02.850 --> 11:04.880
We'll show 'em what we can do.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.050
Let's blow His Lordship's mind.

11:07.050 --> 11:08.270
Haven't you had enough?

11:08.270 --> 11:09.060
Kondo-san!

11:09.970 --> 11:11.630
What a nice garden!

11:09.970 --> 11:14.240
Fujita. Don't just stand there. Earn your pay.

11:11.630 --> 11:12.930
We can really go at it here!

11:12.930 --> 11:14.930
A sword! Bring me a sword!

11:14.950 --> 11:16.520
Hey, I oughta go first!

11:31.080 --> 11:32.130
Miburo, I take it?

11:33.430 --> 11:34.600
What are you doing?

11:35.730 --> 11:38.310
I asked where the men who died are buried.

11:38.510 --> 11:40.180
I'm saying a prayer for them.

11:41.540 --> 11:43.150
Um, what's your name, sir?

11:43.510 --> 11:44.640
I'm called Fujita.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.310
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Nio.

11:47.620 --> 11:50.310
What were the names of
 the deceased gentlemen?

11:52.110 --> 11:53.310
Why do you want to know?

11:53.570 --> 11:59.810
Oh, no real reason. I just thought it'd be nice 
to know a little about the men I'm praying for.

12:01.670 --> 12:03.720
I-Is that strange?

12:04.500 --> 12:05.140
No.

12:07.440 --> 12:12.700
One of the murdered men, Kushibe, 
grew up in the same village as me.

12:13.840 --> 12:14.740
Kushibe-san.

12:15.870 --> 12:20.200
We often trained together. 
I loved the way he used a blade.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.040
We came to serve in Kyoto together,

12:24.830 --> 12:27.500
but he died before 
he could achieve anything.

12:27.970 --> 12:31.680
Did Kushibe-san have, um, a favorite food?

12:32.370 --> 12:33.300
I'm not sure.

12:33.720 --> 12:38.680
Thinking about it, he <i>did</i> love
the sea bream at his sister's wedding.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.710
Sea bream? Thank you very much.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.240
We should get back soon.

12:54.240 --> 12:54.960
Yes, sir.

12:58.460 --> 13:01.600
What a gorgeous view. I didn't realize.

13:02.540 --> 13:07.000
His Lordship wanted their graves 
to command a view of the city.

13:07.640 --> 13:12.150
He may act above it all, 
but our lord knows how to show he cares.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.160
Don't misunderstand him.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.620
Is Kushibe-san up in heaven 
with the Buddhas now?

13:23.510 --> 13:26.540
No. He was a sore loser 
with a jealous streak.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.750
He gave as good as he got.

13:29.570 --> 13:32.380
Kushibe is walking the streets 
of Kyoto as we speak,

13:32.920 --> 13:34.800
even if only his grudges live on.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.040
I made up my mind to do 
enough work for the both of us.

13:43.610 --> 13:46.520
That makes one more thing 
I know about Kushibe-san.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.050
Oh, I left out the most important thing.

13:52.690 --> 13:56.060
You have my sincere 
gratitude for this matter.

13:56.560 --> 14:00.080
O-Oh, no, I barely did anything.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.570
The men down below did it all—

14:01.730 --> 14:02.490
No.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.890
I'm truly glad that his avengers 
were not merely strong,

14:06.470 --> 14:12.080
but willing to show compassion 
to us men of Aizu like you have.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.580
I was wrong to view 
the Miburo as mere outlaws.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.720
N-No...

14:26.140 --> 14:27.480
Thank <i>you</i> very much.

14:28.050 --> 14:32.670
Now I'm <i>certain</i> we did the right thing.

14:35.190 --> 14:39.150
Next time, I'll bring a sea bream <i>this</i> big, 
with the head and tail and all.

14:41.060 --> 14:44.880
I'll ask around about the other three 
before your next visit.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.920
Please do.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.500
Nio! Show off your swordsmanship, too!

15:02.500 --> 15:04.250
I can only do practice swings.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.040
It doesn't matter! Just do it!

15:06.040 --> 15:08.550
His Lordship won't let us stop 
until he sees <i>all</i> of us!

15:08.920 --> 15:11.490
I-In that case, I'll show my practice swings.

15:14.250 --> 15:21.880
One, two, three, four, five...

15:26.190 --> 15:28.910
<i>The Miburo serve Aizu now.</i>

15:29.390 --> 15:31.320
<i>I asked what would change, but...</i>

15:31.560 --> 15:33.580
What's more samurai than serving a lord?

15:34.300 --> 15:36.240
<i>I didn't get a very clear answer.</i>

15:37.040 --> 15:40.330
<i>Still, our hosts, the Yagis, 
were all overjoyed,</i>

15:40.700 --> 15:43.090
<i>and some of us never stopped partying,</i>

15:43.090 --> 15:45.160
<i>so I'm sure it'll be great for us.</i>

15:47.720 --> 15:49.840
I'm back.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.090
You must be tired from patrolling, Todo-san—

15:54.590 --> 15:56.840
All the cherry blossoms have fallen.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.680
Those are autumn leaves.

16:00.190 --> 16:01.710
Anyway, what's the matter?

16:01.930 --> 16:04.150
You seem awfully blue.

16:05.620 --> 16:07.800
Nio! You've got to help me!

16:12.550 --> 16:13.820
Welcome.

16:13.990 --> 16:15.400
What do you think, Nio?

16:15.400 --> 16:17.490
You're right. She seems wonderful.

16:17.960 --> 16:21.870
She's cheerful, considerate, 
and she livens up the whole restaurant.

16:21.870 --> 16:23.800
You <i>know</i> that's not what I mean!

16:23.800 --> 16:24.490
Ow!

16:24.740 --> 16:27.760
What he wants to know is,
would she make a good wife?

16:27.760 --> 16:29.220
Like Heisuke has a chance.

16:29.220 --> 16:30.550
He's got no sex appeal.

16:30.550 --> 16:33.340
Compared to my collection 
of erotic prints...

16:34.880 --> 16:36.090
Shut up!

16:36.260 --> 16:37.900
What are you even doing here?

16:39.330 --> 16:41.970
We can read you like a book!

16:42.350 --> 16:44.970
Man, the nerve of those idiots.

16:45.220 --> 16:48.000
So what do you want my help with?

16:49.750 --> 16:50.990
I'm in love.

16:50.990 --> 16:53.210
Really? I'm rooting for you.

16:53.480 --> 16:58.680
They say you can charm anyone 
with a pulse, so I came to you.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.990
I'm not sure I like how you put that.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.670
Thank you for waiting.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.160
You must really love soba.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.380
This is your fifth visit today.

17:09.380 --> 17:10.160
What?

17:10.500 --> 17:13.130
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

17:13.130 --> 17:15.260
I-I can never get enough soba.

17:20.510 --> 17:22.460
It just tastes so good!

17:24.970 --> 17:27.350
Stop torturing yourself, Todo-san!

17:28.550 --> 17:30.290
What else can I do?

17:30.590 --> 17:31.800
Those're Miburo.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.030
Don't make eye contact.

17:33.590 --> 17:36.450
We <i>do</i> serve Aizu now, right?

17:36.750 --> 17:39.370
It seems the townsfolk 
haven't heard the news.

17:39.370 --> 17:41.500
Oh, of course! Clothes!

17:41.740 --> 17:47.000
Yes, I see. People might trust us more
if we all wore matching coats.

17:47.200 --> 17:52.010
No! Nice clothes and fine swords will 
make her look at me like a whole new man!

17:52.010 --> 17:53.090
<i>Seriously?</i>

18:01.080 --> 18:04.250
He'd never just lend me some, would he?

18:04.470 --> 18:07.210
A sword is a samurai's soul.

18:07.570 --> 18:08.760
Out of the question.

18:08.980 --> 18:10.500
Right you are, sir.

18:10.900 --> 18:11.760
Serizawa-san.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.280
This is an affair of the heart.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.520
Borrow away.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.800
And take my coat, too!

18:21.380 --> 18:22.700
Thank you so much, sir.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.530
Welcome.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.780
Sh-She laughed at me.

18:30.730 --> 18:32.630
It <i>is</i> a little too big for you.

18:32.630 --> 18:35.230
Damn it. I'm down to my last resort.

18:35.430 --> 18:36.800
Come with us!

18:41.590 --> 18:44.910
When she rounds the next corner, 
Sanosuke will start hassling her.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.680
Then I'll come to the rescue.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.470
It's the perfect plan.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.350
It's the <i>scummiest</i> plan.

18:57.370 --> 19:01.040
Um, why did you join the Miburo, Todo-san?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.070
Huh?

19:02.400 --> 19:05.750
I heard you trained at 
Kondo-san's dojo in Edo.

19:09.170 --> 19:11.370
But not all of his students 
followed him here, right?

19:11.780 --> 19:14.470
I was on the fence. You see...

19:14.470 --> 19:16.520
I'm actually pretty tough.

19:17.150 --> 19:17.930
I know.

19:18.250 --> 19:21.760
And I figured I'd get more women 
if I got even tougher.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.040
Not much of a motive, huh?

19:24.040 --> 19:28.020
No, I think it's natural 
for any living creature.

19:28.350 --> 19:30.150
You're one weird kid.

19:31.070 --> 19:34.780
When no one was listening, 
my mom used to tell me,

19:35.190 --> 19:41.280
"You're Lord Izumi-no-kami's bastard son, 
so live up to that legacy."

19:41.540 --> 19:43.300
That's amazing.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.160
Your father's an important man.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.440
I don't believe a word of it.

19:47.440 --> 19:50.190
Still, I want to do something 
to make a name for myself.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.920
It'll make my mom happy.

19:54.950 --> 19:56.150
Shinsuke-san!

19:56.340 --> 19:57.920
Hey. Been waiting long?

20:00.680 --> 20:02.190
Oh, you.

20:06.630 --> 20:08.360
Let's go home, Nio.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.090
Th-That might be a good idea.

20:10.930 --> 20:15.440
What have we here? You're gettin' 
awful frisky out here on a public street.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.960
Let us get in on the fun.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.700
Or hand over your money.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.110
What? That's not Sanosuke-san.

20:22.110 --> 20:23.790
Todo-san, we've got trouble.

20:23.950 --> 20:24.640
Huh?

20:25.750 --> 20:28.030
Ow, ow, ow!

20:27.210 --> 20:28.030
Huh?

20:28.190 --> 20:31.310
Okay, give it a rest.
 The lady's not interested.

20:31.310 --> 20:34.280
Stop! You're gonna break my arm!

20:35.840 --> 20:36.580
Damn it.

20:36.580 --> 20:37.840
Who the hell are you?

20:38.040 --> 20:40.330
A Miburo. And don't you forget it.

20:42.150 --> 20:42.840
Damn it!

20:43.840 --> 20:45.810
Th-Thank you so much.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.150
Todo-san!

20:52.740 --> 20:54.600
What a drag.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.330
Todo-san. Todo-san!

20:56.330 --> 20:57.640
What?

20:58.230 --> 21:00.110
You were incredible!

21:02.360 --> 21:05.330
Nio, I like you!

21:06.360 --> 21:08.120
<b>Barber</b>

21:06.360 --> 21:08.120
<b>Open</b>

21:08.450 --> 21:10.000
Nio, my mind's made up.

21:14.380 --> 21:16.390
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.370
From this day on, 
I live for the people of Kyoto!

21:20.800 --> 21:21.560
Right!

21:22.520 --> 21:24.640
<i>What will serving Aizu change?</i>

21:25.520 --> 21:29.830
<i>We'll work harder than ever 
for the people of this city.</i>

21:30.170 --> 21:31.640
<i>That's good enough.</i>

21:32.040 --> 21:33.540
Come on. Let's go.

21:33.540 --> 21:34.400
I guess.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.320
There's plenty more girls out there!

21:38.320 --> 21:40.440
L-Let's try harder next time.

21:40.450 --> 21:42.100
I want to meet more of 'em.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.160
You will.

21:44.940 --> 21:49.950
<b>Palm of the Hand</b>

23:20.040 --> 23:25.460
<b>Next time</b>

23:21.330 --> 23:27.920
The Lord of Aizu's offer turns 
the Miburo from just a pack of ronin

23:27.920 --> 23:33.920
into agents carrying out the will of 
Aizu Domain, and through it, the Shogunate.

23:34.440 --> 23:38.680
And so, little by little, 
the times start changing.

23:39.310 --> 23:45.560
But the Miburo themselves 
spend their days in youthful fervor.

23:46.170 --> 23:47.920
Next time: "Treasure."

23:47.110 --> 23:49.940
<b>Treasure</b>

23:48.200 --> 23:49.620
It won't disappoint.
