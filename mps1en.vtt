Well, I'm not sure...

but I guess it's not strange that
an old woman is writing novels?

00:20:01.003 --> 00:20:05.483
As some men in the world
commit murders wherever they are,

00:20:05.483 --> 00:20:09.323
some women commit such
hideous murders as well.

in 1987 titled "Small Door."

dares to ask such moronic questions!

that old novel and start blabbering?

00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:47.423
so I don't really have complaints, either.

00:23:50.093 --> 00:23:53.683

- Yeah!

They fit perfectly. Right?

00:27:33.243 --> 00:27:34.833
Is it because my daughter is pretty?

good shoes to go to good places.

Hey! These were not cheap!

00:27:50.233 --> 00:27:54.173
I didn't buy them from where you saw me
earlier. I bought them at an expensive store!

00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:56.573

That's not what I'm...

Did I ask you to buy these?

00:28:03.943 --> 00:28:07.063
I gave money for you to
buy your clothes. Did I or not?

00:28:07.063 --> 00:28:09.303
I have nowhere to wear them, though.

00:28:09.303 --> 00:28:12.753
That's why! That's why, don't go around-

00:28:12.753 --> 00:28:14.753
- This.
- What?

00:28:14.753 --> 00:28:16.773
How many times did I
tell you to throw this out?

00:28:16.773 --> 00:28:20.563
Why are you still wearing this
dirty old thing over ten years old!

00:28:20.563 --> 00:28:22.173
Look at everyone.

00:28:22.173 --> 00:28:25.393
Who is wearing something
like this today? Just look!

00:28:25.393 --> 00:28:28.463
Geez, I shouldn't have bought that for you.

00:28:28.463 --> 00:28:31.893
I got it. My ears hurt. Don't yell.

00:28:32.773 --> 00:28:34.883
Are you that embarrassed?

00:28:41.993 --> 00:28:46.173
Since you mingle with successful
and smart people every day,

00:28:46.173 --> 00:28:49.553
your mom must look like a joke to you.

00:28:50.963 --> 00:28:53.443
Why are you talking like that now?

00:28:54.243 --> 00:28:56.363
But for me,

00:28:56.363 --> 00:28:59.803
even if you wear dirty shoes and a scarf,

00:28:59.803 --> 00:29:01.893
I would never pretend
like I didn't see you.

00:29:01.893 --> 00:29:06.523
For me, no matter what
you wear and what you do,

00:29:06.523 --> 00:29:09.323
I would never ignore you. You know that?

00:29:10.153 --> 00:29:11.603
I won't...

00:29:14.453 --> 00:29:17.163
I won't play with you, either.

00:29:21.533 --> 00:29:23.613
Mom!

00:29:23.613 --> 00:29:25.763
Back then,

00:29:25.763 --> 00:29:28.653
if only I hadn't sent Mom off like that.

00:29:29.763 --> 00:29:31.493
Oh, really.

00:29:31.493 --> 00:29:33.963
Would everything be different?

00:29:33.963 --> 00:29:35.933
