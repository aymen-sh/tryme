<b><i>Who exactly is this Nagi character?</i></b>

00:27.030 --> 00:30.880

00:31.740 --> 00:37.090

00:56.520 --> 00:58.650

00:59.700 --> 01:02.290
<b><i>Yup. This'll work.</i></b>

<b>Blue Genes</b>

02:43.390 --> 02:45.360
<b>All right! We clawed it back!</b>

02:45.730 --> 02:49.540
<b>But why'd our attack 
suddenly start functioning?</b>

02:50.040 --> 02:52.310
<b>They were struggling badly a minute ago.</b>

02:51.910 --> 02:53.640
<b>Blue Lock Staff</b>

<b>Blue Lock

02:54.160 --> 02:56.980
<b>Don't get caught up in the goal itself, gofer.</b>

02:57.680 --> 02:59.230
<b>The key came before that.</b>

03:00.160 --> 03:01.510
<b>Before that?</b>

03:01.880 --> 03:04.570
<b>The play leading up to it.</b>

03:04.950 --> 03:09.660
<b>Itoshi Rin's improvisation 
set everything in motion.</b>

03:10.190 --> 03:13.730
<b>Didn't I tell you? Our players know
 how to handle the real thing.</b>

03:14.310 --> 03:18.920
<b>They have the improvisation skills 
they nurtured in the selections.</b>

03:19.420 --> 03:22.800
<b>You mean things like 
those "chemical reactions"?</b>

03:23.280 --> 03:26.100
<b>Yes, that's one of the improvisation skills.</b>

03:26.640 --> 03:29.530
<b>Off to

03:26.640 --> 03:29.530

03:31.520 --> 03:37.590
<b>When chasing an objective, 
things often don't go as planned.</b>

03:37.850 --> 03:39.000
<b>Whoa!</b>

03:39.000 --> 03:40.960
<b>No one told us about this!</b>

03:40.960 --> 03:47.370
<b>The answers in textbooks and manuals 
are empty theory, useless in the real field.</b>

03:47.880 --> 03:51.090
<b>When the strategy you had 
planned out doesn't work...</b>

03:51.330 --> 03:54.220
<b>This is impossible!</b>

03:52.510 --> 03:54.220
<b>Let's go back for now!</b>

03:54.510 --> 03:59.680
<b>...the mediocre panic and look for 
excuses for their failure to feel better.</b>

04:00.130 --> 04:02.960
<b>Loser</b>

04:00.510 --> 04:02.960
<b>This is the thinking of a loser.</b>

04:03.240 --> 04:06.100
<b>What is the objective 
of this match, Anri-chan?</b>

04:06.100 --> 04:10.430
<b>Huh? Well, um... To win.</b>

04:10.430 --> 04:11.770
<b>Right.</b>

04:11.770 --> 04:16.470
<b>A winner never loses sight of their objective.
 They simply tackle this new challenge.</b>

04:16.830 --> 04:19.650
<b>What should we do?</b>

04:18.160 --> 04:19.650
<b>Hold on.</b>

04:19.910 --> 04:25.150
<b>Even if your plan fails, as long as you 
keep trying to achieve your objective...</b>

04:25.660 --> 04:28.820
<b>I won't give up! 
Onward to Onigashima Island!</b>

04:29.260 --> 04:32.740
<b>...that situation becomes the new challenge.</b>

04:33.310 --> 04:36.960
<b>That's the thinking you need to improvise.</b>

04:37.760 --> 04:40.920
<b>In Blue Lock, we do not need 
mediocre players with no initiative.</b>

04:41.960 --> 04:47.150
<b>What we want are egoists 
who seek out challenges for themselves.</b>

04:47.150 --> 04:51.180
<b>And Itoshi Rin did exactly that
 before anyone else,</b>

04:51.430 --> 04:54.140
<b>and Isagi Yoichi responded to it.</b>

04:54.140 --> 05:00.080
<b>Blue Lock XI</b>

04:55.020 --> 04:59.280
<b>As I thought, Isagi Yoichi is 
necessary for Itoshi Rin's awakening.</b>

05:00.850 --> 05:02.580
<b>Let's go score another.</b>

05:02.580 --> 05:03.310
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:05.050 --> 05:06.650
<b><i>That goal just now...</i></b>

05:07.410 --> 05:09.570
<b><i>Any of them could've scored it.</i></b>

05:09.960 --> 05:13.070
<b><i>That's just how good
 their shooting skills are.</i></b>

05:13.710 --> 05:17.130
<b><i>But it was only possible 
because we disrupted their formation,</i></b>

05:17.130 --> 05:20.960
<b><i>and managed to use our weapon 
the way we'd practiced.</i></b>

05:21.880 --> 05:25.130
<b><i>And the one who gave us
that opening was undoubtedly Rin.</i></b>

05:26.050 --> 05:29.850
<b>Just keep your eyes on me.</b>

05:30.450 --> 05:34.430
<b><i>Those words helped me to focus
on my linkup play with Rin.</i></b>

05:35.400 --> 05:38.250
<b><i>Rin gave me a new challenge.</i></b>

05:39.600 --> 05:40.470
<b>Hey, Rin.</b>

05:41.870 --> 05:43.610
<b>Too bad about that shot.</b>

05:43.610 --> 05:46.700
<b>But it was a good move. 
I'm sure it'll work next time—</b>

05:46.700 --> 05:47.460
<b>Huh?</b>

05:47.460 --> 05:50.140
<b>Shut up. Are you taunting me?</b>

05:50.140 --> 05:52.280
<b>Everything that's not a goal is worthless.</b>

05:52.280 --> 05:55.240
<b>Yeah, but thanks to your play—</b>

05:55.240 --> 05:56.670
<b>So what?</b>

05:57.320 --> 05:59.700
<b>You were aiming to score, too, weren't you?</b>

06:00.290 --> 06:03.750
<b>You followed me like 
goldfish shit into midfield,</b>

06:03.750 --> 06:07.590
<b>but once you were in the area, your ego 
took over and you went for goal yourself.</b>

06:08.480 --> 06:10.050
<b>You got a problem with that?</b>

06:10.340 --> 06:11.950
<b>No. Keep doing it.</b>

06:12.700 --> 06:15.760
<b>Taking advantage and devouring 
each other serves a purpose.</b>

06:16.250 --> 06:20.900
<b>A twisted relationship like that
 is healthy for us.</b>

06:22.140 --> 06:22.940
<b>Right.</b>

06:26.410 --> 06:30.240
<b><i>I see. So it's our dynamics 
that create these innovative plays.</i></b>

06:31.190 --> 06:34.090
<b><i>We're a threat to the other team now.</i></b>

06:35.890 --> 06:38.360
<b><i>Don't get comfortable. Fight.</i></b>

06:38.930 --> 06:41.730
<b><i>For my goal and nothing else.</i></b>

06:43.820 --> 06:45.980
<b><i>There's 15 minutes left in the first half.</i></b>

06:45.980 --> 06:48.400
<b><i>Who would've thought it'd go like this?</i></b>

06:48.400 --> 06:51.430

<b><i>Rin saw it and he's keeping up, if just barely.</i></b>

<b><i>Even if I charge in at full speed...</i></b>

<b><i>My analysis of 'em usin' pregame materials
