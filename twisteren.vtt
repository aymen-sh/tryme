WEBVTT

00:01:36.257 --> 00:01:37.596
Got to get up.

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:38.853
I'm working on it.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:40.269
Seriously, Jeb, it's time to go.

00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:42.761
You found one for us?

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.544
What the hell?

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.817
Storm's here, guys!
Let's go!

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:01.384
Nah. Nah, it can't be.

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:04.079
God, I went
way too hard last night.

00:02:05.056 --> 00:02:06.614
Javi, get up. Come on.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.688
Oh! Come on!

00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:12.487
Where are the trash bags?

00:02:12.623 --> 00:02:13.923
Oh. Found 'em.

00:02:14.058 --> 00:02:15.408
Jeb, are you sure
you're recording?

00:02:15.432 --> 00:02:17.231
- I don't see a red light.
- Oh.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.496
- Yeah. Recording.
- Okay.

00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:20.696
Blah.

00:02:20.832 --> 00:02:22.598
Don't make me laugh. Stop it.

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:24.203
Okay.

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:25.937
Today, our science team

00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:28.048
from the Tornado Tamer project
is out in the field,

00:02:28.072 --> 00:02:30.711
about to chase a storm
southwest of us.

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:32.945
Our experiment is designed
to decrease the moisture

00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:35.198
inside of a tornado to see
if we can make it collapse.

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:37.012
Tell the folks
how you do that, Kate.

00:02:37.148 --> 00:02:38.919
Well, first, we got
to find a tornado

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:40.969
to suck up our superabsorbent
polymers in these barrels...

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:42.691
Diapers.

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:44.868
Tell them it's the same stuff
they use in diapers. Hmm.

00:02:44.892 --> 00:02:46.455
Oh, yeah.
It's nontoxic.

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:50.798
Uh, the Doppler doesn't show
a storm until the afternoon.

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:52.712
The data doesn't see
what Kate sees, remember?

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:54.969
How about Kate sees
a few more hours of sleep?

00:02:55.104 --> 00:02:56.369
That might work.

00:02:56.504 --> 00:02:58.337
Praveen, what are you doing?

00:02:58.472 --> 00:02:59.968
Dorothy's not a desk.

00:03:00.104 --> 00:03:02.771
Come on.
Get in, get in, get in!

00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:04.643
Ready? You know what today is?

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.718
The day we tame a tornado!

00:03:10.154 --> 00:03:11.547
- Yeah!
- All right.

00:03:11.683 --> 00:03:13.218
I'm gonna yak first.

00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:15.056
Ow.

00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:16.754
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:34.536
Kate was right.
Southeast winds are picking up.

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:36.044
Here they are.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.480
It's really building up.

00:03:51.622 --> 00:03:53.531
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi...

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.795
That's not a thing, by the way.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.498
Hey, Mom. What's up?
Yes, it is.

00:03:57.634 --> 00:03:59.194
Yeah, yeah, just chasing
weather around.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.668
It's a thing.
Mm-mm.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:02.831
Yes, we'll be careful,
I promise.

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:04.207
Hey, Mrs. Carter.

00:04:04.342 --> 00:04:05.902
- Hey!
- Hey, Mrs. Carter!

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:08.338
- Hey, Mrs. Carter!
- We miss you.

00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:09.608
Hello.

00:04:09.743 --> 00:04:11.715
Okay, I'll tell 'em. Got to go.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.924
Uh, she says there's barbecue
at the house when we're done.

00:04:13.948 --> 00:04:16.513
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
- Yes, Cathy. Yes.

00:04:20.653 --> 00:04:22.723
Man, I love Oklahoma.

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:24.473
All right, how are we
getting to this thing?

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:25.820
I'll need a southwest position

00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:27.426
to read my sensors.

00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:29.328
Yeah, coming right up.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.270
One Mississi...

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:39.601
Oh.

00:04:41.612 --> 00:04:43.811
Oh, and the wind shear
is strong.

00:04:43.946 --> 00:04:47.216
Got some serious energy
building in there.

00:04:47.352 --> 00:04:49.244
Oh, hey. Hey, buckle up.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.662
Don't...
Don't lean out the window.

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:53.115
Come on. Come back in.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.988
Addy,
that's... Please?

00:04:55.124 --> 00:04:58.262
Ever since you got struck
by lightning, you're no fun.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.092
Yeah, well, that's what happens.

00:05:00.228 --> 00:05:01.530
Mm.

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:03.293
Okay, we should get
the mixture ready.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.594
Uh, don't you want to wait
for the rain to hit first?

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:09.174
Okay, we should, um...

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.380
We should get the mixture ready.

00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:11.508
Yes, we should.

00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:20.646
Jeb!
Yep.

00:05:20.781 --> 00:05:21.809
Come on!
Okay.

00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:23.488
I'm mixing.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.249
You have to mix it.
I got it, I got it.

00:05:25.384 --> 00:05:27.685
Here she is!
That should be enough.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.292
All right.
Okay.

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:30.428
Okay, we're good.

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.689
Hey, hey, look.
Hey, gentle, gentle.

00:05:33.726 --> 00:05:35.290
Like... Right? Come on.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.770
Now try.

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:42.732
Usually it works, but...

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:44.642
This thing is so old.

00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:47.170
Like, I mean, it's old, but
it's field-tested, you know?

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.971
Unlike Kate's science project
over here.

00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:51.046
It's our science project.

00:05:51.182 --> 00:05:52.848
No time, Javi.

00:05:52.984 --> 00:05:54.830
If Dorothy's not working,
then forget the data, okay?

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.763
- We'll worry about it later.
- "Forget the data"? What is...

00:05:56.787 --> 00:05:58.324
The tornado's not gonna wait
for us, Javi.

00:05:58.348 --> 00:05:59.752
There's a death ridge
setting in.

00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:01.857
Probably our last chase
of the season.

00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:03.606
No matter what, we got to get
these barrels in the air

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.298
and see if they can make
a tornado vanish, okay?

00:06:05.322 --> 00:06:07.194
It's more important.

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:09.403
No, how about it's equally as
important we do both, right?

00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:11.427
Look, look, if you make
a tornado vanish with this,

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.135
but you don't get the data
with this,

00:06:13.271 --> 00:06:14.271
who's gonna believe it?

00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:16.040
Oh. Got it.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.807
Fine. Get us the numbers.

00:06:20.942 --> 00:06:22.614
Whatever we need to win
a big fat grant.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.675
Well, I'm all about
my cash money, right?

00:06:24.811 --> 00:06:26.847
Yeah.

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:35.927
You ready?
Let's go!

00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:37.891
Hey, be careful!

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.950
Uh, got a CAPE of 4,000.

00:07:02.086 --> 00:07:04.166
- 100 knots gate-to-gate wind shear aloft.
- Come on.

00:07:04.214 --> 00:07:06.289
Give us a nice respectable EF1.

00:07:06.424 --> 00:07:07.719
I mean, EF2, we'll take it.

00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:09.055
Well, an EF2 would be too big.

00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:10.790
You have no faith, Praveen.

00:07:10.926 --> 00:07:13.432
Just no more of those baby EF0s.

00:07:14.663 --> 00:07:16.193
Javi, how's Dorothy's GPS?

00:07:18.197 --> 00:07:20.131
Dorothy's coming in
loud and clear.

00:07:34.418 --> 00:07:35.987
Are we in the tornado?

00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:40.585
No.

00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:42.417
No, it's behind us.

00:07:44.927 --> 00:07:46.588
- Okay.
- Wait, should I drive faster?

00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:48.960
No, no, no. We've got to drop
the barrels in its path.

00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:50.369
Are... are we gonna see
the path?

00:07:50.393 --> 00:07:52.002
Whoa!

00:07:52.137 --> 00:07:53.472
No! Guys!

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.645
This is the path.

00:08:07.781 --> 00:08:09.080
How close is it?

00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:10.321
That's a lot of lightning.

00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:11.720
Okay, you guys stay here.

00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:13.150
I'll get it.
Wait, wait.

00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:14.856
Hey, we got to help her, guys.

00:08:17.796 --> 00:08:19.623
It's spilling!
We got to hurry!

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:23.997
No, we need leverage to tip it!

00:08:25.995 --> 00:08:27.000
Jeb, hurry!

00:08:39.412 --> 00:08:41.852
Hey, Kate, you got
muscles and brain...

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.218
Brains.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.661
Okay, let's open them up.

00:08:52.527 --> 00:08:53.527
Come on.

00:08:55.828 --> 00:08:56.997
Yeah!

00:08:59.369 --> 00:09:01.639
We're clear!

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:03.667
All right, we got it!
Let's go, let's go!

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:09.405
We got to go!

00:09:13.685 --> 00:09:15.785
Okay, we dropped
the trailer, Javi.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.637
- All right, let's see if it takes the bait.
- Come on, come on, come on.

00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:26.422
What if there's no tornado?

00:09:26.557 --> 00:09:28.666
What if it's just
a dense wave of hail?

00:09:36.873 --> 00:09:38.804
Whoo, baby!

00:09:38.939 --> 00:09:40.837
We just shot up 10,000 feet!

00:09:40.973 --> 00:09:42.236
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:09:42.372 --> 00:09:43.713
Okay, that's not a hail wave.

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:45.815
We did it, Kate.

00:09:49.854 --> 00:09:51.617
Wait, wait.

00:09:51.753 --> 00:09:53.214
It's getting closer.

00:09:55.753 --> 00:09:57.629
Sensors rising, 30,000 feet.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.957
The... the polyacrylate
should be active now.

00:10:00.093 --> 00:10:01.656
Are the winds weakening, Javi?

00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:04.803
Dorothy can't tell you that.
Lagrangian mechanics.

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:06.978
A moving sensor can't give you
the exact measurement

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.405
of wind speed, but...

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.432
Ah, yeah! 40,000 feet.

00:10:11.568 --> 00:10:13.276
Your tornado
isn't shrinking, Kate.

00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:14.811
50,000 feet.

00:10:17.975 --> 00:10:19.145
Holy shit.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.919
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
This can't be right.

00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:27.582
Javi, talk to us.

00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:29.991
Javi, talk to us.

00:10:32.594 --> 00:10:33.795
Talk to us.

00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:35.830
Sensors just shot up
70,000 feet.

00:10:35.965 --> 00:10:38.060
- What?
- Uh, the... the NEXRAD velocity

00:10:38.195 --> 00:10:39.434
is 200 miles per hour.

00:10:39.569 --> 00:10:40.569
That's impossible.

00:10:41.902 --> 00:10:43.400
Unless it's an EF5.

00:10:49.412 --> 00:10:50.978
Guys.

00:10:51.113 --> 00:10:53.079
Guys, whatever's in there,
it's big.

00:10:53.214 --> 00:10:54.950
It's big and it's moving fast.
Drive!

00:10:55.085 --> 00:10:56.982
You got to get the hell
out of there!

00:10:57.117 --> 00:10:58.916
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

00:10:59.052 --> 00:11:00.516
How did it become an EF5?

00:11:03.123 --> 00:11:04.190
It's getting closer!

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:07.363
Oh! Look out!

00:11:18.805 --> 00:11:19.805
Everybody okay?

00:11:23.748 --> 00:11:26.914
- We can't stay here.
- There!

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.144
Overpasses are the worst
in tornadoes.

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:30.348
What do we do?

00:11:38.598 --> 00:11:40.457
This car's gonna fly. Come on!

00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:44.867
Jeb, Addy, Praveen, Kate!

00:11:45.003 --> 00:11:46.315
Guys, you got
to get out of there!

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:47.530
Do you hear me?

00:11:48.097 --> 00:11:49.097
Kate!

00:12:11.463 --> 00:12:12.956
Come on.

00:12:27.512 --> 00:12:28.538
Kate, come on!

00:12:32.241 --> 00:12:33.241
Where's Praveen?

00:12:34.551 --> 00:12:36.282
Kate! Kate!

00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:40.081
Come on!

00:12:40.216 --> 00:12:41.284
No, Kate!

00:12:41.419 --> 00:12:42.893
Come on!

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:49.224
Addy! Addy!

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.396
Come on!

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.433
Put your arms around the rail!

00:12:56.837 --> 00:13:00.308
Get in! Get in!

00:13:00.443 --> 00:13:03.072
Put your arms around the rail!
You're gonna be okay!

00:13:05.881 --> 00:13:07.848
It's gonna be okay!

00:13:07.984 --> 00:13:10.820
Keep holding on! I've got you!

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.652
I've got you, Kate!
I've got you!

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:17.624
Jeb!

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:38.699
The next stop is 42nd Street.

00:14:45.048 --> 00:14:46.743
Come along, everyone.

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:50.185
Our regional office focuses on
New York metro weather,

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.185
but we can see weather
around the country here.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.092
Now, see these red outlines?

00:14:57.228 --> 00:14:59.357
We're having
extremely unusual activity

00:14:59.493 --> 00:15:01.165
in this region called
Tornado Alley.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.726
Is a tornado coming to New York?
Oh, no.

00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:06.367
Tornadoes are extremely rare
in New York.

00:15:06.503 --> 00:15:12.372
Though, we had an EF1
hit Brooklyn two years ago.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.903
Whoa.

00:15:16.038 --> 00:15:18.347
We have
20 full-time meteorologists...

00:15:18.483 --> 00:15:20.259
All right, looks like
we got some rain coming.

00:15:20.283 --> 00:15:21.947
Wind speed's currently
at 28 knots,

00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:23.511
moving northeast at 15.

00:15:23.647 --> 00:15:25.114
We should call in an advisory.

00:15:25.249 --> 00:15:26.882
Hey, Debra? De...

00:15:27.017 --> 00:15:28.921
The model projects
it's heading into Maryland.

00:15:29.057 --> 00:15:30.319
I'll make the call.

00:15:30.454 --> 00:15:32.623
Kate. What do you see?

00:15:36.864 --> 00:15:37.892
Um...

00:15:39.235 --> 00:15:41.428
Wind speeds have fallen
two knots.

00:15:41.564 --> 00:15:43.138
Structure is weakening.

00:15:43.273 --> 00:15:44.578
Looks like
it's all falling through.

00:15:44.602 --> 00:15:46.501
I think it's gonna lose steam.

00:15:46.637 --> 00:15:48.637
Let's hold off on any alerts.

00:15:48.772 --> 00:15:50.773
Okay.
Keep an eye on it.

00:15:52.711 --> 00:15:54.344
Kate. There's a guy here
to see you.

00:15:54.479 --> 00:15:55.778
He's in the conference room.

00:15:57.722 --> 00:15:58.990
Hi. I'm Kate.

00:16:03.353 --> 00:16:04.391
Hey, Kate.

00:16:06.059 --> 00:16:08.323
Hey.

00:16:08.458 --> 00:16:09.792
It's been a while.

00:16:13.964 --> 00:16:17.334
After graduation,
I went back to Miami.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.837
Felt like I needed to regroup.

00:16:19.972 --> 00:16:22.505
Shit, you wouldn't believe it.
I joined the military.

00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:24.640
- You joined the military?
- Yeah.

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.248
I was just feeling kind of lost.

00:16:27.978 --> 00:16:30.318
I tried reaching out to you
a few times.

00:16:30.453 --> 00:16:33.517
Yeah, I'm not great
with communication.

00:16:33.652 --> 00:16:34.987
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I figured.

00:16:35.123 --> 00:16:37.028
You know, life and all.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.767
But I hadn't heard from you,
so, you know,

00:16:38.791 --> 00:16:40.572
I stopped by your mom's
in Sapulpa to check in.

00:16:40.596 --> 00:16:42.924
She said... she said
you don't come home anymore.

00:16:44.302 --> 00:16:46.694
I knew you moved,
but I didn't expect you

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.499
to move somewhere like New York.

00:16:48.634 --> 00:16:50.705
New York's great.
I like it here.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.974
People are nice.

00:16:53.707 --> 00:16:55.537
Get your ass out of the street!

00:16:55.673 --> 00:16:57.478
Most people.

00:16:57.613 --> 00:16:59.573
My job in the military was
operating one of these.

00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:03.019
Phased Array Radar... PAR.

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:05.116
You know, scanning for missiles.

00:17:05.252 --> 00:17:06.490
Leveled up from Dorothy.

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:08.189
Many levels.

00:17:08.325 --> 00:17:09.885
This thing was
so powerful and so fast,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.159
I could watch a moth fly
from, like, a mile away.

00:17:13.294 --> 00:17:15.429
But I kept asking myself...

00:17:15.564 --> 00:17:18.201
What if we point this thing
at a tornado?

00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:20.203
Well, Javi,
it's the size of a building.

00:17:20.338 --> 00:17:21.913
You'd never be able
to get it close enough.

00:17:21.937 --> 00:17:23.206
Until now.

00:17:24.904 --> 00:17:27.039
The military, they came up
with portable units,

00:17:27.174 --> 00:17:28.671
and they're small.

00:17:28.807 --> 00:17:30.609
I got my hands
on a few prototypes.

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.766
Yo, my man, can...
can I borrow this real quick?

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.181
Thanks. Appreciate it.

00:17:39.316 --> 00:17:40.454
Um...

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.688
All right, look.

00:17:43.824 --> 00:17:46.563
Let's say this...
this is a tornado, right?

00:17:50.802 --> 00:17:52.000
My team drives up.

00:17:52.136 --> 00:17:54.601
We place a portable PAR here.

00:17:54.736 --> 00:17:57.141
It's giving me incredible
high-resolution images,

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:58.876
but th... but they're still
kind of flat.

00:17:59.569 --> 00:18:01.078
So what do we do?

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:04.610
My team sets up two more,
here and here.

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:06.717
Now we have a...

00:18:06.853 --> 00:18:08.218
A three-dimensional scan.

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:10.947
The most perfect scan
of a tornado ever.

00:18:11.082 --> 00:18:14.620
Kate, we can use this data
to save lives back home.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.888
- I mean, this is incredible.
- I know.

00:18:20.024 --> 00:18:21.474
And you're the only person
that can get me

00:18:21.498 --> 00:18:23.134
close enough to a tornado
to do this.

00:18:27.101 --> 00:18:28.768
Javi, I...

00:18:28.903 --> 00:18:31.006
- No, I... I don't chase anymore.
- Come on, Kate.

00:18:31.142 --> 00:18:32.736
What have you been doing here?

00:18:32.871 --> 00:18:34.609
Uh, sitting behind
a computer screen?

00:18:34.745 --> 00:18:36.147
Like...

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.122
The girl I know,
she'd be going into the storms

00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:39.590
while everyone else
was running away.

00:18:39.614 --> 00:18:41.310
Well, I'm not
that person anymore.

00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:42.846
You have a gift.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.521
Look, I... I can't do this
without you.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.390
Look, I... I...
should really be getting back.

00:18:55.525 --> 00:18:56.596
But, um...

00:18:57.936 --> 00:18:58.994
it was good seeing you.

00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:02.501
You be careful out there?

00:19:08.945 --> 00:19:09.945
Kate.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.008
You ever wonder...

00:19:14.782 --> 00:19:16.484
why it was us
that made it out of there?

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:35.305
It's gonna be okay.

00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:37.308
It's gonna be okay.

00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:39.534
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.373
It's gonna be okay.

00:19:41.508 --> 00:19:42.980
I got you.

00:20:10.338 --> 00:20:11.970
Hey, Kate.

00:20:12.105 --> 00:20:14.640
Another town got hit last night
with no warning.

00:20:14.776 --> 00:20:16.124
We're having
a once-in-a-generation

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:18.547
tornado outbreak in Oklahoma.

00:20:18.682 --> 00:20:20.378
It's coming after
the people we love.

00:20:20.514 --> 00:20:21.879
It's getting worse every year,

00:20:22.014 --> 00:20:24.354
but now we have a way
to fight back.

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:26.549
Just give me one week
out here, Kate.

00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:29.044
I got a good team, but the only
thing that's missing is you.

00:20:29.455 --> 00:20:30.455
Call me back.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.180
I'm not gonna lie.
I didn't think you'd come.

00:21:08.191 --> 00:21:10.268
Nice upgrade
from the old van, right?

00:21:12.195 --> 00:21:14.068
Yeah, how are you paying
for all this?

00:21:14.204 --> 00:21:15.634
Got investors, you know.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.098
Storms are getting more erratic,

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:18.834
lot of new housing developments
going up,

00:21:18.907 --> 00:21:21.178
so the developers, they want
full-time weather data.

00:21:21.314 --> 00:21:22.773
So, anytime
a new building goes up,

00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:24.648
I want a StormPAR radar
right there

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:27.316
letting the people know exactly
what the storm's gonna do.

00:21:27.451 --> 00:21:28.811
I'm telling you,
I really feel like

00:21:28.881 --> 00:21:30.201
we're gonna change
the game, Kate.

00:21:32.857 --> 00:21:34.286
What?

00:21:34.422 --> 00:21:36.284
No, it's just, um...

00:21:36.419 --> 00:21:39.354
business entrepreneur was not
how I saw your future.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.629
And we used to feel lucky if
we could get you to wear pants.

00:21:42.765 --> 00:21:44.665
Well, that hasn't
completely changed.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.296
You got it?

00:22:16.432 --> 00:22:17.658
Bring it in, team.

00:22:19.399 --> 00:22:20.700
All right.

00:22:20.836 --> 00:22:22.965
You guys have all heard me
talk about Kate.

00:22:23.101 --> 00:22:24.868
How no one has better instincts.

00:22:25.003 --> 00:22:26.304
She's the smartest person
I know.

00:22:26.439 --> 00:22:27.504
She's the best.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.939
And you will never work

00:22:29.074 --> 00:22:31.008
with a more talented team
than this one.

00:22:31.144 --> 00:22:36.484
Look, we got PhDs from
NASA, FEMA, NOAA, NWS.

00:22:36.619 --> 00:22:38.019
Oh, you've got
the whole alphabet.

00:22:38.155 --> 00:22:39.718
Only the best.

00:22:39.854 --> 00:22:41.491
Except for Scott,
my partner here.

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:43.720
He went to MIT
instead of Muskogee State.

00:22:43.855 --> 00:22:45.220
But, uh, he makes up for it

00:22:45.355 --> 00:22:47.695
with his beautiful,
amazing personality.

00:22:50.502 --> 00:22:51.926
Well, Kate's only
giving us a week,

00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:54.729
but while we have her, ooh!

00:22:54.865 --> 00:22:57.498
It's gonna be the wildest tornado
week you've ever seen, fellas.

00:22:59.371 --> 00:23:01.811
Yeah, and everybody with
a $10 weather app knows it.

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:04.177
We got to stay
ahead of this circus.

00:23:20.626 --> 00:23:22.025
Hey, StormPAR.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.632
We're live on YouTube.
Say something.

00:23:23.767 --> 00:23:25.172
- Blow me, Boone.
- Don't engage, don't engage.

00:23:25.196 --> 00:23:27.635
Hey, smile, man.
Science is fun, right?

00:23:27.771 --> 00:23:29.697
What's up, Boone?

00:23:29.833 --> 00:23:30.936
Who are they?

00:23:32.243 --> 00:23:33.937
Chasers out of Arkansas.

00:23:34.072 --> 00:23:35.605
Hillbillies with
a YouTube channel.

00:23:43.184 --> 00:23:45.079
Hey, T! Tell the folks
how you're feeling.

00:23:45.214 --> 00:23:47.618
I'm feeling pretty good, Boone.

00:23:47.753 --> 00:23:48.959
And if you feel it...

00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:50.192
Chase it!

00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:51.888
I said, if you feel it...

00:23:52.024 --> 00:23:53.891
Chase it!
Chase it!

00:23:56.569 --> 00:23:59.166
Oh, it's a beautiful day.

00:23:59.302 --> 00:24:00.502
Beautiful day!

00:24:00.638 --> 00:24:03.034
Go on! Go on, baby!
Huh.

00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:04.773
Hmm. Okay.

00:24:10.446 --> 00:24:12.273
That's Tyler Owens.

00:24:12.408 --> 00:24:14.243
He calls himself
a Tornado Wrangler.

00:24:15.551 --> 00:24:16.619
What does that even mean?

00:24:18.217 --> 00:24:20.451
Hey, you tornado nerds!
Who wants a T-shirt?

00:24:22.056 --> 00:24:23.919
This means our world
is going to shit.

00:24:24.054 --> 00:24:25.962
Okay, we got mugs!

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:27.937
Whatever you put in here, it's
gonna make it taste better.

00:24:27.961 --> 00:24:29.302
You're gonna get thirsty
out there.

00:24:29.326 --> 00:24:30.441
You look thirsty.
You look sweaty.

00:24:30.465 --> 00:24:31.465
Give me some cash.

00:24:34.531 --> 00:24:36.106
All right,
give me that, give me that.

00:24:36.241 --> 00:24:38.168
Who else wants a mug?

00:24:38.303 --> 00:24:40.839
All right, let's get
ahead of this bunch.

00:24:40.975 --> 00:24:42.638
Yeah, let me see this.
All right, Kate.

00:24:43.843 --> 00:24:45.010
Which storm should we chase?

00:24:50.415 --> 00:24:52.175
There's a nice-looking cell
over to the east.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.541
It's, uh, it's been a while.

00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:13.237
I... I'll just watch
on this first one.

00:25:13.373 --> 00:25:15.190
No, no. Kate, Kate,
it's all right. You got this.

00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:16.338
It's why you're here.

00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:23.226
All right, all right, guys,
let's go.

00:25:23.349 --> 00:25:25.219
Everybody get
their last bathroom break in.

00:25:25.354 --> 00:25:26.766
All right, be quick, fellas.
We're on the clock.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:27.959
Five minutes,
then we're loading up.

00:25:27.983 --> 00:25:29.054
Here we go.

00:25:30.623 --> 00:25:32.887
Okay, uniforms.

00:25:33.023 --> 00:25:34.394
Wrinkle-free shirts.

00:25:34.529 --> 00:25:35.962
Crisp hats. Good.

00:25:36.097 --> 00:25:37.669
Ah, looks like
they're going to church, man.

00:25:37.693 --> 00:25:39.506
- I like it. Right?
- Looking good, looking good.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.398
Hey, man,
you're not gonna hold the door?

00:25:41.534 --> 00:25:42.875
Come on, man. Too heavy?
StormPAR.

00:25:42.899 --> 00:25:44.431
StormPAR.

00:25:44.566 --> 00:25:45.999
All right, see you out there.

00:25:46.135 --> 00:25:47.369
Thanks so much.

00:25:50.506 --> 00:25:52.407
Come on, Kate.
You got this.

00:26:08.158 --> 00:26:09.358
What is she doing?

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:12.933
She's doing her thing, man.

00:26:40.357 --> 00:26:42.622
You know,
I used to do that, too.

00:26:42.758 --> 00:26:45.467
Compare the wind direction
to cloud movement.

00:26:45.603 --> 00:26:47.264
Get you a feel for the shear.

00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:53.237
Yep. Sometimes the old ways
are better than the new.

00:26:54.742 --> 00:26:56.108
What is Owens up to?

00:26:58.348 --> 00:26:59.877
You tell me.

00:27:00.013 --> 00:27:01.410
So, where you coming in from?

00:27:02.715 --> 00:27:03.786
New York.

00:27:05.384 --> 00:27:07.623
Well, you're a long way
from home, city girl.

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:09.253
So you like working
for StormPAR?

00:27:11.897 --> 00:27:14.588
Tyler, do we know which storm
we're going after yet?

00:27:16.567 --> 00:27:17.567
Well, why don't we ask...

00:27:18.829 --> 00:27:19.862
Kate.

00:27:19.998 --> 00:27:22.332
Hi, Kate. I'm Tyler.

00:27:23.736 --> 00:27:25.436
And I'm Ben.

00:27:25.572 --> 00:27:28.512
I'm a reporter, doing a piece
on American storm chasing.

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.570
- Yeah.
- Tyler's letting me ride along.

00:27:30.706 --> 00:27:32.277
Yeah, Ben just had
to promise to write

00:27:32.413 --> 00:27:33.733
nothing but good stuff about me.

00:27:33.847 --> 00:27:35.015
Good luck with that.

00:27:35.912 --> 00:27:37.621
Hang on.

00:27:37.757 --> 00:27:40.351
You didn't say which way
we were going yet.

00:27:40.486 --> 00:27:45.487
Now, from what I gather,
west, we double our chances.

00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:49.700
East, well, it's high risk,
high reward.

00:27:50.666 --> 00:27:52.460
Well, go for the reward.

00:27:52.596 --> 00:27:54.179
You don't want Ben to think
you're boring.

00:27:54.203 --> 00:27:56.123
No, boring is not usually
a problem for me, Kate.

00:27:58.144 --> 00:28:00.707
The two cells to the west are
fighting over the same inflow.

00:28:00.843 --> 00:28:02.703
They'll choke each other out.

00:28:02.838 --> 00:28:05.045
This one to the east
has the sky all to herself.

00:28:06.143 --> 00:28:07.843
Moisture, wind shear,

00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:10.083
instability.

00:28:10.219 --> 00:28:12.217
All the things you need
to give Ben a good show.

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:16.452
City girl knows her stuff, Ben.

00:28:18.093 --> 00:28:20.157
I said, city girl knows
her stuff, Ben.

00:28:20.293 --> 00:28:22.225
Thanks. Maybe if
I work real hard,

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.932
I could be
a Tornado Wrangler, too.

00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:29.901
Talk to us.

00:28:30.037 --> 00:28:31.500
We want the cells to the west.

00:28:31.636 --> 00:28:34.005
Uh, the one to the east
has much better numbers.

00:28:34.141 --> 00:28:35.421
Mm, conditions don't feel right.

00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:36.979
Cap is too strong.
It'll never break.

00:28:37.041 --> 00:28:38.078
You heard her.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:39.948
Let's move.

00:28:41.147 --> 00:28:42.322
All right, let's move, fellas.

00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:44.381
All right.

00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:46.856
Guess we're listening
to dandelions now.

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.194
I thought she told us east.

00:28:56.094 --> 00:28:57.196
She going the wrong way?

00:28:58.302 --> 00:28:59.330
Nope.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.914
What did the tornado cowboy
have to say?

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.679
Exactly what you'd expect.

00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:21.825
Oh, updraft is cycling.

00:29:23.387 --> 00:29:24.954
Okay, let's take a right
up here.

00:29:36.072 --> 00:29:37.907
It's forming
just like you called it.

00:29:42.112 --> 00:29:44.975
Scarecrow, Tin Man,
get into position.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.278
Wizard, stick with me.

00:29:49.684 --> 00:29:51.152
What's the plan?

00:29:51.287 --> 00:29:53.350
So, we want a 3D scan
of the entire area

00:29:53.486 --> 00:29:55.098
around the vortex,
which means we're gonna

00:29:55.122 --> 00:29:56.626
surround it with three radars,

00:29:56.762 --> 00:29:58.657
each one pointed at the tornado.

00:29:58.792 --> 00:30:00.293
Tin Man will get

00:30:00.428 --> 00:30:01.288
behind the tornado
and plant his radar

00:30:01.424 --> 00:30:02.558
on the right-hand side.

00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:05.997
Scarecrow is gonna
get behind the tornado

00:30:06.133 --> 00:30:08.304
and plant his on the left.

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:11.508
And all the data that they send
will be received by Wizard.

00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:13.140
And how about Lion?

00:30:15.738 --> 00:30:17.939
We got to complete the triangle.

00:30:18.075 --> 00:30:20.950
We get right in front of that
thing and set up our radar.

00:30:22.719 --> 00:30:25.153
You got this, Kate.

00:30:25.288 --> 00:30:27.290
Just tell us where the front
of the tornado is.

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:28.887
Okay.

00:30:29.023 --> 00:30:30.652
That's our tornado, baby!

00:30:47.837 --> 00:30:49.337
All right, what's up, chat?

00:30:49.473 --> 00:30:50.480
Welcome back.

00:30:50.616 --> 00:30:51.944
Thank you for joining us.

00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:54.144
It is a perfect weather day.

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:56.380
We just had tornado genesis.

00:30:56.516 --> 00:30:58.817
I'm looking at a tall rope
due north of us,

00:30:58.952 --> 00:31:00.088
and she is pretty.

00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:02.992
Dumbasses!

00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:04.647
It's like the wild, wild West
out here.

00:31:09.535 --> 00:31:11.093
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

00:31:17.335 --> 00:31:19.804
Joining us today, per usual,

00:31:19.939 --> 00:31:22.638
- got my chief storm hound, Boone.
- Boonie, baby.

00:31:22.774 --> 00:31:25.240
We got Dexter and Dani
in the caravan behind us.

00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:29.188
- And Lily with her drone ready.
- What's good? What's poppin'?

00:31:29.212 --> 00:31:30.446
What's good?

00:31:30.582 --> 00:31:32.219
And our special guest today,

00:31:32.354 --> 00:31:34.817
we got Ben in the back seat.

00:31:34.952 --> 00:31:37.250
Ben, you just came in from, uh,
London yesterday, right?

00:31:37.385 --> 00:31:38.489
Uh, uh, yes.

00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:41.121
South London.

00:31:41.256 --> 00:31:43.791
J... Uh, just between Streatham
Hill and West Norwood.

00:31:45.601 --> 00:31:46.903
Okay.

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:48.598
- Tyler, tornado's on the move.
- Okay.

00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:04.513
Oh, yeah!

00:32:04.649 --> 00:32:05.954
Oh, it's on now, Ben!

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.715
You ain't in London anymore!

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.528
Strattonham, Berkshire,
what the hell?

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:12.996
Get me in front of it.

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:14.691
Okay, wait.
Uh, we need to take a right.

00:32:14.795 --> 00:32:16.663
Here.

00:32:19.434 --> 00:32:20.961
Lion, this is Scarecrow.

00:32:21.096 --> 00:32:24.235
Tornado is moving steady
at one-seven miles per hour.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:26.702
Damn. Dandelion girl was right.

00:32:26.837 --> 00:32:29.406
All right, who asked you, man?
Just drive.

00:32:29.541 --> 00:32:31.073
Slow down.
Keep us out of the hail.

00:32:32.882 --> 00:32:34.780
We got golf balls, baby!

00:32:36.285 --> 00:32:37.647
Are those golf balls
or baseballs?

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:41.284
Grapefruit!

00:32:44.323 --> 00:32:46.020
I'm assuming this is safe.

00:32:50.493 --> 00:32:52.728
Heads up! Okay, okay.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.479
You little beauty.

00:33:15.153 --> 00:33:18.519
Hey, what are you doing?

00:33:18.655 --> 00:33:20.658
That's the Tyler Owens effect.

00:33:20.793 --> 00:33:23.129
Wizard, hang back.
Get those hard drives fired up.

00:33:23.264 --> 00:33:25.960
Copy that. Wizard hanging back.

00:33:26.096 --> 00:33:28.036
The path is shifting.

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.452
Okay, there's a right coming up.

00:33:34.136 --> 00:33:37.146
This is Tin Man!
Approaching our PAR position!

00:33:44.451 --> 00:33:48.316
Ready?
One, two, three!

00:33:48.452 --> 00:33:50.060
- Lock!
- Lock!

00:33:52.994 --> 00:33:54.130
Tin Man is active!

00:34:00.305 --> 00:34:02.501
Okay, Tin Man,
PAR data is coming in.

00:34:14.146 --> 00:34:15.978
Where, Kate?

00:34:16.113 --> 00:34:18.579
We got to be within 300 meters
for the radar to work.

00:34:18.714 --> 00:34:20.189
Scarecrow's taking position.

00:34:31.503 --> 00:34:32.503
Go!

00:34:34.473 --> 00:34:35.501
Lock it!

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:40.708
Javi, Scarecrow is active.

00:34:40.843 --> 00:34:41.936
Scarecrow is up.

00:34:43.313 --> 00:34:44.433
Okay, Scarecrow, we got you.

00:34:44.476 --> 00:34:45.676
Waiting on you, Lion.

00:34:46.575 --> 00:34:47.711
Okay, take these.

00:34:52.183 --> 00:34:54.268
Come on, Kate, talk to me,
talk to me. We getting close?

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:56.456
Just up there in the clearing.

00:35:14.339 --> 00:35:16.546
Kate! I need you!

00:35:20.277 --> 00:35:21.277
Kate!

00:35:24.086 --> 00:35:25.445
Kate!

00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:26.750
Javi, get in!

00:35:27.724 --> 00:35:28.752
Get in!

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:41.878
- What is it? What is it? What do you see?
- This isn't right.

00:35:41.902 --> 00:35:43.899
Hang on, guys.
We're gonna find a closer spot.

00:35:45.937 --> 00:35:47.969
Is this where it's headed?

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:53.079
Javi, I...

00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:04.018
We're too far!

00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:13.126
StormPAR!

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.830
Javi!

00:36:15.966 --> 00:36:17.366
What are you doing
out here, man?

00:36:17.502 --> 00:36:19.200
Tornado's that way.

00:36:20.437 --> 00:36:21.437
Hey, Kate.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.404
Nice goggles, Javi!

00:36:27.886 --> 00:36:30.214
All right! Here we go!

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:33.416
Whoa, buddy!

00:36:38.488 --> 00:36:39.695
Oh, yeah!

00:36:40.956 --> 00:36:42.194
All right, boys, harnesses on.

00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:43.694
Harness time!

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:45.667
Oh, yeah,
it's my favorite part, Ben.

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:48.469
- Harness?
- Yeah, we're entering the suck zone, baby.

00:36:48.604 --> 00:36:50.364
- Ben, put your harness on.
- I'm doing it.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.904
We're going to a tornado
for God's sakes.

00:36:54.039 --> 00:36:57.707
Oh, yeah!

00:36:57.842 --> 00:36:59.344
All right, here it comes!

00:36:59.479 --> 00:37:01.207
Uh, my harness won't do up.

00:37:01.343 --> 00:37:03.684
- My harness won't do up!
- Ben, you got to hurry.

00:37:03.819 --> 00:37:05.788
- Damn, Ben.
- Why didn't you tell me this before?

00:37:05.924 --> 00:37:07.256
Just put your strap on.

00:37:07.392 --> 00:37:09.421
You're a wild man!
Oh, God!

00:37:24.437 --> 00:37:25.869
Are those fireworks?

00:37:28.911 --> 00:37:30.142
Yep.

00:37:30.277 --> 00:37:32.041
Oh, yeah!

00:37:45.193 --> 00:37:46.219
Yeah!

00:37:52.368 --> 00:37:53.529
How you feeling, brother?

00:37:53.665 --> 00:37:55.498
Oh, top of the world, man.

00:37:55.633 --> 00:37:57.272
All thanks to my crew.

00:37:57.407 --> 00:37:58.936
I got Boone on camera.

00:37:59.071 --> 00:38:01.611
We got Lily, Dexter, Dani.

00:38:01.747 --> 00:38:05.409
You viewers asked me, "Can you
shoot fireworks up a tornado?"

00:38:05.544 --> 00:38:07.181
And the answer is yes.

00:38:07.317 --> 00:38:08.479
Yes, you can.

00:38:08.615 --> 00:38:10.316
How we doing back there, Ben?

00:38:10.452 --> 00:38:12.714
Ben? Oh.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.583
All right, all right.

00:38:14.719 --> 00:38:16.986
If you feel it, chase it.

00:38:17.121 --> 00:38:18.960
Remember, you kids,
do not try this at home.

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.625
We are professional

00:38:20.761 --> 00:38:22.121
- Tornado Wranglers.
- Yes, indeed.

00:38:23.362 --> 00:38:24.362
He's insane.

00:38:24.432 --> 00:38:25.962
Yeah!
Yeah.

00:38:40.777 --> 00:38:42.110
I'm sorry, Javi. I...

00:38:43.416 --> 00:38:44.486
I screwed up.

00:38:48.122 --> 00:38:49.150
Hey.

00:38:50.127 --> 00:38:52.326
We'll find another one.

00:38:52.462 --> 00:38:53.742
It's all part of the gig, right?

00:38:55.229 --> 00:38:57.024
Yeah, of course.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.632
I'm gonna go check in
with Scott.

00:39:45.682 --> 00:39:47.379
Haven't we stayed here before?

00:39:47.514 --> 00:39:48.880
Yeah, Javi,

00:39:49.015 --> 00:39:51.018
we've stayed
in every motel in Oklahoma.

00:39:53.315 --> 00:39:56.250
Remember we used to have
Addy check in?

00:39:56.385 --> 00:39:58.359
Then later,
we'd all sneak into the room

00:39:58.494 --> 00:39:59.990
so we could all save ten bucks?

00:40:02.897 --> 00:40:04.302
We'd have Addy do it
'cause she was...

00:40:04.326 --> 00:40:06.095
'Cause she looked so sweet.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.970
Hey, um, you want
to hang out later?

00:40:14.408 --> 00:40:16.041
I'll go, you know,

00:40:16.176 --> 00:40:19.041
just go into the room
real quick, and, obviously...

00:40:19.177 --> 00:40:21.209
shower, and we can
come back out here.

00:40:23.378 --> 00:40:26.280
Um, I'm...
I'm real tired, but, um...

00:40:27.752 --> 00:40:28.887
maybe another time?

00:40:31.192 --> 00:40:32.220
Yeah.

00:40:33.723 --> 00:40:34.924
All right.

00:40:35.059 --> 00:40:36.499
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

00:40:38.764 --> 00:40:40.331
It's good to have you back.

00:40:40.467 --> 00:40:42.005
I'm not back.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.297
I remember. One week.

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:50.413
Yeah. We did it.

00:40:50.549 --> 00:40:52.141
Here we go, now we gotta top it.

00:40:54.876 --> 00:40:56.252
City girl.

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:58.555
Hey!

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.649
"The cells to the west
will choke each other out,"

00:41:01.784 --> 00:41:03.152
she said.

00:41:03.287 --> 00:41:05.153
"The one to the east
will put on a show."

00:41:05.288 --> 00:41:06.825
Well, didn't throw you
off the scent.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.757
Hey, that's what makes
Tyler famous.

00:41:09.893 --> 00:41:11.264
You mean on YouTube?

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.632
Uh, y-yeah.

00:41:12.768 --> 00:41:13.529
Yeah, we're... we're on
the YouTube.

00:41:13.664 --> 00:41:14.998
We got what?

00:41:15.134 --> 00:41:16.240
About a million subscribers
now, huh?

00:41:16.264 --> 00:41:17.137
Yes, sir.

00:41:17.273 --> 00:41:18.475
Uh, Kate what?

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.320
Your surname, just in case
I include you in my piece.

00:41:23.941 --> 00:41:27.183
Oh, um, just Kate's fine.

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:28.344
She's a tricky one.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.815
Mm-hmm.

00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:31.744
Actually, you made
a good call earlier.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.286
The other cell, it looked
stronger, but cap never broke.

00:41:34.422 --> 00:41:36.521
What's a cap?

00:41:36.657 --> 00:41:38.462
It's a temperature inversion in the
mid part of the lower atmosphere.

00:41:38.486 --> 00:41:40.523
It inhibits a storm
from forming.

00:41:40.658 --> 00:41:41.894
Right. Okay.

00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:43.967
Good.

00:41:44.027 --> 00:41:45.735
Where did you guys all meet?

00:41:45.871 --> 00:41:48.833
Did you, uh... did you study
meteorology at the U of A?

00:41:48.968 --> 00:41:50.932
No. No.

00:41:51.067 --> 00:41:52.332
All right, Kate, me?

00:41:52.467 --> 00:41:53.485
You know,
I just flow with the wind.

00:41:53.509 --> 00:41:55.140
You know what I'm saying?

00:41:55.275 --> 00:41:57.315
Yeah, I... I never went to,
like, school or nothing.

00:41:57.342 --> 00:41:59.648
Um, Tyler, he... he studied
meteorology, though.

00:42:00.747 --> 00:42:02.278
Him?
Yeah.

00:42:02.413 --> 00:42:04.133
You know, he's a cowboy
scientist, you know.

00:42:04.186 --> 00:42:05.865
- He's got this natural instinct.
- Okay, Boone.

00:42:05.889 --> 00:42:08.691
- He taught me everything I know, so...
- Boone.

00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:10.650
You know, our crew's
not like your crew, Kate.

00:42:10.786 --> 00:42:13.589
We don't need PhDs and fancy
gadgets to do what we do.

00:42:13.724 --> 00:42:15.057
I guarantee you,

00:42:15.193 --> 00:42:17.159
these guys have seen
more tornadoes

00:42:17.295 --> 00:42:19.435
than anyone else
in this lot combined.

00:42:19.571 --> 00:42:20.866
Is that right?
Do you think

00:42:21.001 --> 00:42:22.241
there's a chance
we'll see one tomorrow?

00:42:22.265 --> 00:42:23.898
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

00:42:24.033 --> 00:42:25.831
Outbreak, baby.

00:42:25.967 --> 00:42:28.704
You know, if you can keep up,
we'll put you in the episode.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.305
Wow.

00:42:31.845 --> 00:42:33.541
Where are you chasing tomorrow?

00:42:33.677 --> 00:42:35.580
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not falling for that again.

00:42:35.715 --> 00:42:37.616
Kate's from New York.

00:42:37.752 --> 00:42:39.613
Can't trust a thing she says.

00:42:39.749 --> 00:42:43.048
Well, can always trust a guy
who puts his face on a T-shirt.

00:42:44.827 --> 00:42:47.454
Man.
Man, that was good.

00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:49.091
Oh, my God, look at his face.

00:42:49.226 --> 00:42:50.424
That was spicy, wasn't it?

00:42:52.834 --> 00:42:54.193
You got to see this, guys!

00:42:54.328 --> 00:42:55.435
Y'all got to see this!

00:42:56.801 --> 00:42:58.001
Let's go!

00:43:04.211 --> 00:43:07.407
This is a 4WARN weather alert.

00:43:07.542 --> 00:43:09.247
All right, Oklahoma,

00:43:09.383 --> 00:43:11.096
we could be looking at
a record number of tornadoes.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.446
We've been talking about this
for days now.

00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:15.153
We'll need to stay weather-aware

00:43:15.289 --> 00:43:17.721
with possible major storms
across Oklahoma

00:43:17.857 --> 00:43:19.421
over the next 36 hours.

00:43:19.557 --> 00:43:22.632
These are the properties
that were wiped out yesterday.

00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:24.601
And all the information
we can pull on them.

00:43:27.368 --> 00:43:28.368
Hmm.

00:43:29.232 --> 00:43:30.462
How about the owners?

00:43:30.598 --> 00:43:32.308
Most of the properties
are underinsured

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:33.563
or have no insurance at all.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.711
Uh, we did talk to a few people

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:38.408
who are very interested
in an all-cash offer.

00:43:38.544 --> 00:43:39.579
Mm-hmm.

00:43:39.715 --> 00:43:41.848
When do you want to head out?

00:43:41.983 --> 00:43:43.748
Kate, this is...
this is Marshall Riggs.

00:43:43.883 --> 00:43:45.481
We've been working together.

00:43:45.616 --> 00:43:47.030
He's one of the StormPAR
investors I told you about.

00:43:47.054 --> 00:43:49.087
How scary was
that tornado yesterday?

00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:53.356
Not at all.

00:43:53.491 --> 00:43:55.762
Listen, can you give
us a couple minutes?

00:43:55.898 --> 00:43:57.596
Maybe grab something
to eat or...

00:43:57.732 --> 00:43:58.734
And then we can head out.

00:44:05.975 --> 00:44:08.573
Well, boys, when's the next one?

00:44:18.482 --> 00:44:20.486
Well, nothing's
coming out of that one.

00:44:20.621 --> 00:44:23.386
That one? No, no.

00:44:23.522 --> 00:44:25.761
No, it's clearly moving into
a stable environment.

00:44:28.795 --> 00:44:30.930
Yeah. No low-level CAPE.

00:44:31.065 --> 00:44:32.759
Not enough shear
to keep it interesting.

00:44:32.895 --> 00:44:35.176
- Yeah, it's gonna die out.
- Not enough moisture to grow.

00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:42.561
Where'd you say you learned
how to track storms again?

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:44.214
I didn't.

00:44:46.675 --> 00:44:47.990
You know, we're gonna be
stuck here all day

00:44:48.014 --> 00:44:49.880
waiting for nothing to happen.

00:44:50.016 --> 00:44:51.583
How about we try to get along?

00:44:51.719 --> 00:44:53.517
Yeah, you're right.

00:44:53.652 --> 00:44:56.456
Tell you what, I'll... I'll
get us a couple of drinks.

00:44:56.592 --> 00:44:57.592
What would you like?

00:44:59.097 --> 00:45:00.097
Really?

00:45:01.022 --> 00:45:02.463
Really.

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.192
Wouldn't mind an iced tea.

00:45:04.327 --> 00:45:06.065
- Thank you.
- Coming up.

00:45:20.008 --> 00:45:22.126
Gonna have a lot more materials
to send you before too long.

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:23.877
Let's keep helping
each other out.

00:45:24.012 --> 00:45:25.022
We'll be in touch, all right?
We got to go.

00:45:25.046 --> 00:45:26.718
Oh.

00:45:26.853 --> 00:45:29.222
All right. Um, look...

00:45:29.357 --> 00:45:31.691
- We're almost done here.
- Now. We got something big.

00:45:31.826 --> 00:45:32.991
The moisture's hung up here,

00:45:33.126 --> 00:45:34.653
so that's where
we want to focus.

00:45:34.789 --> 00:45:36.929
Pack up the burritos.
We got a winner.

00:45:37.065 --> 00:45:38.526
Lily, get your drone in the air.

00:45:38.661 --> 00:45:40.496
We need your video stream.
Ride with us.

00:45:40.631 --> 00:45:43.102
- Northwest, ten o'clock?
- That's the one. Let's ride.

00:45:43.237 --> 00:45:44.774
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:48.239
Showtime, baby.

00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:51.310
Clear!

00:45:51.446 --> 00:45:53.948
All right, come on, Cairo!

00:45:57.615 --> 00:45:59.617
Let's go, guys! Let's go!

00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:13.064
Damn, Tyler's on it.

00:46:37.796 --> 00:46:39.958
Ah. Kate must have seen
the storm, too.

00:46:40.093 --> 00:46:41.897
They just passed
Dexter and Dani.

00:46:43.227 --> 00:46:45.361
So what's the deal with her?

00:46:45.496 --> 00:46:47.835
Why don't we focus
on our story, Ben?

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:51.005
Sorry. She's just...
intriguing.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.041
What do you see?

00:46:55.177 --> 00:46:57.012
Okay, already has
a nice structure.

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:59.343
Moisture levels are just right
and lots of CAPE.

00:47:00.442 --> 00:47:01.642
What else are you seeing?

00:47:02.949 --> 00:47:04.481
Flow is clean.

00:47:04.616 --> 00:47:06.482
Pulling tons of warm,
moist air from the south.

00:47:06.617 --> 00:47:07.984
And when that warm air
and moisture

00:47:08.119 --> 00:47:09.651
busts through the cap,

00:47:09.786 --> 00:47:11.604
it explodes in the atmosphere,
creating an anvil.

00:47:11.628 --> 00:47:13.193
The vertical wind shear

00:47:13.328 --> 00:47:16.123
begins to rotate the updraft,
forming a mesocyclone.

00:47:16.259 --> 00:47:17.733
Here's the mystery.

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:19.735
We don't know
how a tornado forms.

00:47:19.871 --> 00:47:21.729
We see the hook
on the radar, but...

00:47:21.864 --> 00:47:23.972
What are all the invisible
factors coming together?

00:47:25.334 --> 00:47:26.733
Every little detail that

00:47:26.868 --> 00:47:27.985
- has to be perfect.
- Has to be perfect.

00:47:28.009 --> 00:47:29.668
And it's a mix of what we know

00:47:29.804 --> 00:47:31.241
and everything
we can't understand.

00:47:31.377 --> 00:47:33.542
It's part science,
part religion.

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:39.385
Come on, baby. Come on.

00:47:39.521 --> 00:47:41.132
- Please. Please, please, please.
- Come on. Come on.

00:47:41.156 --> 00:47:42.516
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

00:47:43.691 --> 00:47:44.792
There it is.

00:47:44.927 --> 00:47:47.290
Yeah, baby!

00:47:47.425 --> 00:47:49.091
There we go, Ben!

00:47:49.226 --> 00:47:50.392
- Hey! See that?
- Yeah.

00:47:50.527 --> 00:47:52.033
That's a tornado
right there, baby.

00:47:52.168 --> 00:47:53.595
Get some photos of that, Ben.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.490
The birth of a tornado,
nature's masterpiece.

00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:06.154
Please tell me you guys are
seeing this right now.

00:48:06.178 --> 00:48:07.642
Oh!

00:48:07.777 --> 00:48:09.709
We got twins! Twins!
We have twins.

00:48:09.844 --> 00:48:11.212
Oh, my goodness.

00:48:11.347 --> 00:48:12.712
Is... is that normal?

00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:14.885
They're rotating.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.798
Wait, there's a name for that.
There's a name. There's a name.

00:48:16.822 --> 00:48:17.869
- Shh. Just, hey, just watch it.
- There's a name for that.

00:48:17.893 --> 00:48:19.561
Just enjoy it, man.

00:48:19.697 --> 00:48:20.893
Fujiwhara Effect!

00:48:21.028 --> 00:48:24.525
Fujiwhara Effect!

00:48:24.661 --> 00:48:26.226
Oh, they're pulling apart.

00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:27.127
One's gonna die out.

00:48:27.262 --> 00:48:28.432
Go faster.

00:48:34.709 --> 00:48:35.709
You ready?

00:48:37.582 --> 00:48:38.706
Let's get our data.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.129
Come on, Javi.

00:48:57.027 --> 00:48:59.070
Oh, they got they fancy little
trucks there, don't they?

00:48:59.094 --> 00:49:00.948
- Come on, faster! Faster!
- You guys ready to rock?

00:49:00.972 --> 00:49:02.337
Let's go!

00:49:02.472 --> 00:49:03.472
Whoa!

00:49:05.767 --> 00:49:07.772
Come on!

00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:10.911
Go for it. Get around him.

00:49:11.046 --> 00:49:12.321
Get on his left.
Get on his left.

00:49:12.345 --> 00:49:14.107
- I'm trying.
- Well, try harder.

00:49:14.243 --> 00:49:15.888
- To the right! Come on, come on.
- No, I'm not doing that.

00:49:15.912 --> 00:49:18.052
Oh, we got a little
bob and weave going on here.

00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:19.582
- Come on, now.
- Nope, nope, nope.

00:49:19.717 --> 00:49:21.447
All right, guys,
let's stop playing games.

00:49:21.583 --> 00:49:22.589
Let's cut these guys off.

00:49:27.897 --> 00:49:29.421
Come on!

00:49:29.557 --> 00:49:30.758
I told you. I told you.

00:49:33.334 --> 00:49:34.828
Eyes on the road.

00:49:43.373 --> 00:49:44.475
There you go, Owens.

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:51.516
All right,
which one's gonna stay?

00:49:51.651 --> 00:49:53.265
- Which one's it gonna be, Kate?
- Okay, I'm on it.

00:49:53.289 --> 00:49:54.660
All right, Tyler,
we got to make a choice.

00:49:54.684 --> 00:49:56.164
Which one are we going,
left or right?

00:49:56.259 --> 00:49:57.891
All right, y'all,
we got Tyler Owens here

00:49:58.027 --> 00:49:59.559
making a high-pressure choice.

00:49:59.694 --> 00:50:01.128
Boone.

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:02.944
Stop filming for a second?
I need to think.

00:50:02.998 --> 00:50:04.661
Yeah, no, of course.

00:50:04.796 --> 00:50:06.438
Hey, Tyler doesn't want you
to see this, all right?

00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:07.531
He's... he's thinking.

00:50:09.733 --> 00:50:11.638
All right, Lily,
what are you seeing?

00:50:11.774 --> 00:50:13.445
Uh, it's looking like the
inflow is cranking on the right.

00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:14.801
Let's go for the right.

00:50:14.937 --> 00:50:16.377
Uh, there should be
a road coming up.

00:50:16.442 --> 00:50:17.779
All right,
we're taking the right.

00:50:17.915 --> 00:50:19.272
All right, right, guys, right.

00:50:19.408 --> 00:50:20.974
Why the right?

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:23.383
Well, it's got a strong inflow
of warm, moist air.

00:50:23.518 --> 00:50:25.384
Tornado won't have to work
as hard, Benny.

00:50:38.659 --> 00:50:39.666
- Go left!
- What?

00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:41.202
Take a left!

00:50:43.633 --> 00:50:45.373
Going left. Go left, go left.

00:50:45.508 --> 00:50:47.835
Javi, you sure? The right
one's got better numbers.

00:50:51.344 --> 00:50:53.182
That's a bad move, honey buns!

00:50:53.317 --> 00:50:55.437
Who the hell is making
decisions up there, him or her?

00:51:02.183 --> 00:51:04.456
Your intriguing girl
just screwed the pooch, Ben.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.530
All right, get us set up, Boone.
Yes, sir.

00:51:14.665 --> 00:51:16.314
Gonna fire a couple flares straight
up this thing's ass. Will do.

00:51:16.338 --> 00:51:18.669
All right,
drone's on the ground.

00:51:18.804 --> 00:51:20.835
Hang on. What are you...
Hey, Ben.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:22.775
Excuse me. Uh...
How are you?

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:24.554
What are you doing?
Lily, I need you up here.

00:51:24.578 --> 00:51:26.047
Sorry.
These are my new trousers.

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:27.444
Can you get my foot, mate?

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.108
Sorry, Ben.
It's okay.

00:51:29.243 --> 00:51:30.758
All right,
how we doing back there, Boone?

00:51:30.782 --> 00:51:32.154
Good.
Hundred yards to intersect.

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:34.116
- Dexter, hang back.
- Slow, slow, slow, slow.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.092
All right, Boone. We ready?
Yep. Yep.

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:39.994
God, do we have to drive
into it again?

00:51:40.129 --> 00:51:42.359
Nah, Ben. It's driving into us.

00:51:44.026 --> 00:51:45.257
Ain't no other way.

00:51:48.328 --> 00:51:50.205
Hey, Ben, I'm gonna
need you to hand me

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.200
some of them rockets
in the bag, please.

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:56.412
Thank you!

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:04.785
Sing it, Ben!

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.285
Locked and loaded!

00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:12.666
Hey, Boone, I'm having trouble
with this trigger here.

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:13.690
What?
What's going on?

00:52:13.722 --> 00:52:15.730
Give me the Phillips-head.

00:52:15.865 --> 00:52:17.842
All right, here. Hey, Ben,
can you get me some water?

00:52:17.866 --> 00:52:19.666
Yeah, feels like it's a little sticky.
Oh, no.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:23.669
Oh, man.

00:52:23.805 --> 00:52:25.739
Boone, this is all chocolate.
Sorry, man.

00:52:25.875 --> 00:52:27.719
You got to quit eating
chocolate in the damn truck.

00:52:27.743 --> 00:52:29.623
Promise, I'm not gonna
bring no chocolate anymore.

00:52:29.647 --> 00:52:30.982
Oh, no. Hey, all right,
we're good to go.

00:52:31.006 --> 00:52:32.006
Here we go.

00:52:35.152 --> 00:52:37.276
Augers deployed.
What?

00:52:37.411 --> 00:52:39.846
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

00:52:39.982 --> 00:52:41.982
Yeah!

00:52:43.654 --> 00:52:46.022
Let's go!

00:52:46.157 --> 00:52:47.860
Yeah!

00:53:10.853 --> 00:53:11.853
Was that it?

00:53:23.766 --> 00:53:25.362
Hey.

00:53:25.497 --> 00:53:26.961
We should've went with her.

00:53:27.096 --> 00:53:28.700
Whoo, baby, let's go!

00:53:28.835 --> 00:53:30.835
That was amazing, Kate.
How did you even know that?

00:53:30.872 --> 00:53:32.843
Well, did you see the wheat?
Winds moved to the north.

00:53:32.867 --> 00:53:34.005
Just what this one needed.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:40.079
Scarecrow's up! Scarecrow's up!

00:53:40.215 --> 00:53:42.746
Tin Man is up! Go, go, go!

00:54:03.668 --> 00:54:05.538
We're all set! Kate, come on!

00:54:09.574 --> 00:54:10.741
All PARs are active, Javi.

00:54:25.758 --> 00:54:27.019
Javi, it's turning, fast!

00:54:27.155 --> 00:54:30.257
How we looking?
Wizard, talk to me!

00:54:30.393 --> 00:54:32.829
We lost your radar, Javi.
You got eyes on the tornado?

00:54:52.857 --> 00:54:54.089
What was that?

00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:55.464
I think I killed some chickens.

00:55:14.405 --> 00:55:15.806
Come on!

00:55:43.702 --> 00:55:45.132
Thank God, it just grazed us.

00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:53.306
Javi?

00:55:53.441 --> 00:55:55.343
- Javi, you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you.

00:55:55.478 --> 00:55:57.175
All right, we got
two radars looking good.

00:55:57.311 --> 00:55:58.649
Third one was getting
great data.

00:55:58.785 --> 00:56:01.787
We just need to find it,
download it all.

00:56:01.922 --> 00:56:05.660
Javi, the... the tornado
is headed to a small town.

00:56:05.796 --> 00:56:07.701
They already called it in.
There's nothing we can do now.

00:56:07.725 --> 00:56:09.023
But someone might need help.

00:56:09.158 --> 00:56:10.529
There's a GPS tracker
on the radar.

00:56:10.664 --> 00:56:11.999
We need to find it
before it dies.

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:13.699
Javi, we've got to help.

00:56:31.783 --> 00:56:33.291
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're imposing a curfew

00:56:33.315 --> 00:56:35.522
for the safety
of everyone in the area.

00:56:35.657 --> 00:56:37.426
Unless you're a safety official,

00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:39.593
please clear the area
till 5:00 a.m.

00:56:42.425 --> 00:56:44.466
Yeah, let us know if you need
anything, all right?

00:56:45.664 --> 00:56:47.202
You were right back there.

00:56:47.337 --> 00:56:48.767
It's good that we came to help.

00:56:50.538 --> 00:56:51.902
I wish we could do more.

00:56:53.708 --> 00:56:56.243
Javi, can the data
from the PAR radar

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:57.946
show us how the tornado died?

00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.508
Yeah. Why?

00:56:59.644 --> 00:57:02.011
I don't know.

00:57:02.146 --> 00:57:03.786
Maybe we could use it
to prevent all this.

00:57:05.683 --> 00:57:07.016
There's the Kate I know.

00:57:10.919 --> 00:57:12.918
Hey, look, um, here.

00:57:13.054 --> 00:57:14.386
Take the truck, all right?

00:57:15.764 --> 00:57:17.499
I'll go deal with
locating the radar.

00:57:18.265 --> 00:57:19.325
You should rest.

00:57:20.302 --> 00:57:21.635
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:57:25.899 --> 00:57:27.265
Come on, buddy.

00:57:32.747 --> 00:57:34.241
You got that in a medium?

00:57:37.113 --> 00:57:39.751
Was a nice play
on the left twin.

00:57:39.887 --> 00:57:43.118
Yeah, well, didn't help
these people any.

00:57:43.254 --> 00:57:45.283
Oh, this is, uh...
this is my Uncle Marshall.

00:57:45.419 --> 00:57:47.252
This is the, uh, owner
of the bar here.

00:57:47.387 --> 00:57:48.787
- How you doing?
- You're the owner?

00:57:48.896 --> 00:57:50.795
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I'm sorry what happened.

00:57:50.931 --> 00:57:52.571
We're gonna make it right.
Here's my card.

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.232
Didn't know StormPAR was
in the business of helping.

00:57:55.367 --> 00:57:57.687
Well, from what I see, they're
trying to make a difference.

00:57:58.771 --> 00:57:59.931
That's one way of putting it.

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:01.169
What?

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.608
Do you even know
who you're chasing for?

00:58:05.744 --> 00:58:08.023
- What are you talking about?
- How much more do these people got to lose

00:58:08.047 --> 00:58:10.111
before y'all are done
making a difference?

00:58:10.246 --> 00:58:12.214
Sorry, says the guy
setting up shop,

00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:15.117
selling T-shirts and mugs
after a storm's hit.

00:58:15.252 --> 00:58:17.350
Tyler, you have a minute
for some questions?

00:58:17.485 --> 00:58:19.790
Yeah, I got a dog to find.
Talk to Kate.

00:58:19.926 --> 00:58:21.246
She seems to have
all the answers.

00:58:21.361 --> 00:58:22.956
Hey, Boone?

00:58:23.091 --> 00:58:24.698
Now's not a good time, Ben.

00:58:29.504 --> 00:58:32.541
Kate. Here, take some food.

00:58:32.676 --> 00:58:34.609
- Oh, don't have any cash.
- Nah, it's free.

00:58:34.744 --> 00:58:36.584
That's why we're always selling
those T-shirts.

00:58:37.614 --> 00:58:39.209
- Got some free food.
- Thank you.

00:58:39.344 --> 00:58:41.318
Free water. Make sure
you stay hydrated, all right?

00:58:41.342 --> 00:58:43.011
Appreciate y'all.
Oh.

00:58:43.147 --> 00:58:46.146
Well, save it.
In case you run low.

00:58:46.282 --> 00:58:48.585
Okay. Well, at least
take some water.

00:58:48.721 --> 00:58:49.987
- Thanks.
- Yeah. See ya.

00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.457
It just took everything.

00:58:59.698 --> 00:59:01.064
Everything's gone.

00:59:01.199 --> 00:59:02.637
Officials are estimating

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:04.229
residential property damage alone

00:59:04.364 --> 00:59:06.137
in the millions of dollars.

00:59:06.272 --> 00:59:08.974
How much more damage
will these storms cause?

00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:11.338
Forecasters say
the storms aren't done yet.

00:59:11.473 --> 00:59:13.109
The Blackwell Public Library

00:59:13.244 --> 00:59:14.614
is dealing
with devastating damage.

00:59:24.555 --> 00:59:28.058
Some of Javi's crew said you
were staying out by the rodeo.

00:59:30.323 --> 00:59:31.567
Thought you might be hungry.

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:56.258
You find the dog?

00:59:56.283 --> 00:59:57.384
Of course I found the dog.

00:59:59.287 --> 01:00:00.453
How you doing after all that?

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:03.924
I mean, it doesn't matter.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.458
It's those people that...

01:00:07.596 --> 01:00:10.232
Yeah, well, you've seen
the worst of this place.

01:00:12.602 --> 01:00:15.105
Thought it'd be nice
for you to see something good.

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:18.839
Want to take you somewhere.

01:00:18.975 --> 01:00:20.110
Think it might help.

01:00:23.251 --> 01:00:24.251
Come on.

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:33.891
Hyah! Hyah!

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.396
Hyah! Come on! Come on!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:00:42.532 --> 01:00:44.601
Picking him up on the heel side.

01:00:44.737 --> 01:00:46.598
Can we get two legs?

01:00:46.733 --> 01:00:49.536
Oh, he slipped a leg.
That'll be a plus five.

01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:52.637
The best part is, Stillwater,
they are one of yours.

01:00:52.772 --> 01:00:54.815
So send them out
with just a little bit...

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:56.652
You ever see anything
like this, city girl?

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:00.656
You keep calling me that.

01:01:02.119 --> 01:01:04.526
You know I grew up on a farm?

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:07.454
Yeah. Sapulpa.
Couple hours from here.

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.523
This ain't my first rodeo.

01:01:10.659 --> 01:01:13.592
Look at that.
I learned something about you.

01:01:20.872 --> 01:01:22.806
So tell me this.

01:01:22.941 --> 01:01:24.570
What was your first tornado?

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:26.741
Tell me yours.

01:01:26.876 --> 01:01:28.046
I was eight.

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:30.719
Driving with my aunt.

01:01:31.816 --> 01:01:33.083
Sirens are going.

01:01:33.218 --> 01:01:36.316
All of a sudden,
this vortex just lowers

01:01:36.452 --> 01:01:38.188
right down in the center
of the road.

01:01:39.792 --> 01:01:41.158
I was just mesmerized.

01:01:42.191 --> 01:01:43.622
Then I looked at my aunt,

01:01:43.757 --> 01:01:45.437
and she's got this look
on her face, and...

01:01:47.104 --> 01:01:49.224
I realized in that moment
I was supposed to be scared.

01:01:49.734 --> 01:01:50.734
Were you scared?

01:01:51.867 --> 01:01:52.867
Yeah.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:56.778
Yeah, I was.

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:59.607
Oh, the Tornado Wrangler
is scared of tornadoes.

01:02:01.813 --> 01:02:02.813
Okay, Sapulpa.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.189
Do you know him?

01:02:14.188 --> 01:02:15.863
I used to compete.

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:19.064
Got my head stomped on
by one too many bulls.

01:02:19.199 --> 01:02:20.804
Thought college might be
better for my brain.

01:02:20.828 --> 01:02:24.265
You're scared of tornadoes
but not of riding bulls?

01:02:24.401 --> 01:02:27.101
Well, tornadoes, bulls,
same thing.

01:02:27.236 --> 01:02:29.635
Fear's the reason you do it.

01:02:29.770 --> 01:02:33.276
You don't face your fears,
you ride 'em.

01:02:54.299 --> 01:02:55.739
Were you tracking cells
out this way?

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:04.311
Air feels heavy.
This isn't good.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:19.532
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just received word

01:03:19.556 --> 01:03:21.324
a tornado has touched down
near the area!

01:03:21.459 --> 01:03:23.093
We need to evacuate
this arena right now!

01:03:23.229 --> 01:03:25.097
Once again,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:03:25.232 --> 01:03:26.832
we need to evacuate
this arena right now!

01:03:29.965 --> 01:03:32.041
Keep moving, Kate. Come on.
Keep moving, keep moving.

01:03:32.065 --> 01:03:33.934
Evacuate
the rodeo grounds immediately!

01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:36.872
Once again, a tornado
has just touched down...

01:03:46.285 --> 01:03:47.956
Come on, Kate.
All right, you got it.

01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:50.061
- I got her. You're all right.
- Come here, come here.

01:03:50.085 --> 01:03:52.405
- You're all right. You're all right.
- All right, come on.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.898
Get inside! Get inside!

01:03:59.034 --> 01:04:01.461
All right, watch out, watch out.

01:04:01.597 --> 01:04:03.063
Whoa, stop!

01:04:03.199 --> 01:04:04.564
Stop, stop, stop!

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.038
All right.
Keep going, keep going.

01:04:06.174 --> 01:04:07.494
Wait, wait, wait!
Hey, hey, hey!

01:04:08.176 --> 01:04:09.936
Okay, just get in the car,
okay, honey?

01:04:10.071 --> 01:04:11.831
Hey! Get inside! Ma'am,
stay out of the car.

01:04:11.946 --> 01:04:13.276
- Come here.
- Come to Mommy.

01:04:13.412 --> 01:04:14.943
Hello. Nothing works
in this shithole.

01:04:15.079 --> 01:04:16.676
Now the cable's out.

01:04:16.812 --> 01:04:18.532
I can't get a soda
from the vending machine.

01:04:18.651 --> 01:04:20.594
- The pool's empty as shit.
- Do you have a storm shelter?

01:04:20.618 --> 01:04:22.328
Man, the AC's blowing hot air.
No. I'm sorry.

01:04:22.352 --> 01:04:23.592
Can we get a refund going here?

01:04:23.685 --> 01:04:24.491
All right,
maybe like a basement.

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:25.993
Do you have a basement?

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:27.589
No.
There's a line here, buddy.

01:04:27.724 --> 01:04:28.773
We need to get these people
underground right now.

01:04:28.797 --> 01:04:30.492
Okay, there's no tornado.

01:04:30.627 --> 01:04:32.724
Nine times out of ten,
it's a false alarm.

01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:44.143
- You hear that?
- Now the power's out.

01:04:44.279 --> 01:04:47.374
- No tornado.
- We got to find a shelter, fast.

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:49.016
Hey!

01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:00.164
Hey, I don't want to
have to give you a bad review.

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:02.200
- I just started working here.
- Man, I don't want to have...

01:05:02.224 --> 01:05:03.302
- Everybody, come with me!
- All right, follow her, follow her.

01:05:03.326 --> 01:05:04.366
All right. Ma'am, come on.

01:05:04.492 --> 01:05:06.101
Come on. Move, move, move.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:07.093
- Move, move, move. We got to go.
- Hey. Whoa.

01:05:07.228 --> 01:05:08.228
Hey. What?

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:13.341
There's a tornado!
There's a tornado!

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:16.340
Hey! Let's hop
in the Jeep!

01:05:16.475 --> 01:05:18.213
Keep going!
It's too close!

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:19.692
Let's go! Come on! Let's go!
Go, go, go, go!

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:21.075
Let's go! Come on, get in!

01:05:21.211 --> 01:05:24.579
Go! Ah! Get in the car!

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:29.250
Go, go, go, go, go!
All right, go, go!

01:05:34.057 --> 01:05:35.057
Come on, honey.

01:05:35.124 --> 01:05:36.589
Watch your step!

01:05:36.725 --> 01:05:38.564
All right,
we got to move faster!

01:05:38.699 --> 01:05:40.259
Keep going! All
right, you got her?

01:05:42.231 --> 01:05:44.863
No! No! Stop!

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.141
No!

01:05:52.276 --> 01:05:53.775
We got to go! We got to go!

01:05:53.911 --> 01:05:54.950
Go!

01:05:58.916 --> 01:06:00.745
Okay. Okay, hold on.
Come on, honey.

01:06:00.881 --> 01:06:02.117
Okay, you got to stay low.

01:06:02.253 --> 01:06:03.518
- Cover her eyes.
- Okay.

01:06:03.653 --> 01:06:05.173
- Hold on tight! Hold on tight!
- Okay.

01:06:05.293 --> 01:06:06.768
- Okay, you're gonna be okay.
- Hold on, honey.

01:06:06.792 --> 01:06:07.919
Tyler!

01:06:14.529 --> 01:06:16.261
No, Kate! Stay with them!

01:06:16.396 --> 01:06:17.471
Help me!

01:06:20.941 --> 01:06:22.808
All right. Look at me.

01:06:22.943 --> 01:06:24.140
All right, stay down.

01:06:24.275 --> 01:06:25.745
Just grab my hand. Come on.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.572
I got you. I got you.

01:06:27.707 --> 01:06:29.678
Don't let it get me! Please!

01:06:29.813 --> 01:06:31.976
Keep your head down.
Just stay low. Eyes on me.

01:06:32.112 --> 01:06:33.912
- I can do it.
- Stay low! No, no, no, no, no!

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:35.555
- No, I can do it.
- No, no! No, no, no!

01:06:38.619 --> 01:06:40.362
- Hang on!
- Help me!

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:41.497
Stay down!

01:06:41.623 --> 01:06:42.892
- Help me!
- No, no, no, no!

01:06:54.435 --> 01:06:55.505
Tyler!

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:07.478
We're gonna be okay!

01:07:07.614 --> 01:07:09.253
We're going to be okay!

01:07:09.389 --> 01:07:10.992
I've got you.

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.688
It's going to be okay.
I've got you.

01:07:14.654 --> 01:07:15.855
It's going to be okay.

01:07:16.962 --> 01:07:18.066
It's all right.

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.803
It's gonna be okay.

01:07:21.938 --> 01:07:24.171
I've got you. I've got you.

01:07:41.218 --> 01:07:42.222
Tyler?

01:07:49.526 --> 01:07:51.198
Are you okay?
Yeah.

01:07:53.966 --> 01:07:54.966
Is it over?

01:08:47.117 --> 01:08:48.288
Kate!

01:08:52.991 --> 01:08:53.991
Kate.

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.035
When I saw the size of it
on the radar

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:03.633
and... and where it was headed,

01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:04.981
- all I could think was...
- I'm... I'm all right.

01:09:05.005 --> 01:09:06.005
I'm all right.

01:09:07.274 --> 01:09:08.770
So where did you stick it out?

01:09:09.877 --> 01:09:11.003
Right down here.

01:09:12.748 --> 01:09:13.748
Good call.

01:09:15.378 --> 01:09:16.378
It's all Kate.

01:09:19.717 --> 01:09:21.197
You've been with Owens
the whole time?

01:09:22.087 --> 01:09:23.422
Yeah. Why?

01:09:25.223 --> 01:09:26.656
Javi.

01:09:26.791 --> 01:09:28.439
Apparently, this, uh,
place was family-owned,

01:09:28.463 --> 01:09:29.935
so I'm gonna start
working up some numbers.

01:09:29.959 --> 01:09:31.629
Riggs is gonna want those
first thing.

01:09:31.764 --> 01:09:33.271
Okay, man, I'll...
I'll catch up with you guys.

01:09:33.295 --> 01:09:34.295
Yeah.

01:09:34.934 --> 01:09:36.866
Javi...

01:09:37.002 --> 01:09:40.072
what is Riggs getting out of
all your data collection?

01:09:40.207 --> 01:09:42.538
What's... what's it matter?

01:09:42.674 --> 01:09:44.142
Is profiting
off of people's tragedy

01:09:44.277 --> 01:09:45.378
part of your business plan?

01:09:46.608 --> 01:09:47.677
Why are you doing this?

01:09:49.951 --> 01:09:51.083
Wait, hold on.

01:09:51.219 --> 01:09:52.482
Riggs is offering these people

01:09:52.618 --> 01:09:54.013
a way to move on
with their lives.

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:56.517
He's swooping in
and taking advantage of people

01:09:56.653 --> 01:09:59.050
who have just lost everything.

01:09:59.186 --> 01:10:01.196
You... you have no idea
what that's like.

01:10:03.231 --> 01:10:04.595
I don't know what that's like?

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:09.497
How about losing
three of my best friends

01:10:09.632 --> 01:10:12.472
while you were trying to land a big,
fat grant for your science project?

01:10:16.844 --> 01:10:17.668
Huh.

01:10:17.804 --> 01:10:19.379
Kate. Kate, I didn't...

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:23.876
Kate!

01:10:26.317 --> 01:10:27.546
Mm-hmm.

01:10:27.681 --> 01:10:29.247
Kate. Wait, wait.

01:10:29.383 --> 01:10:31.325
Don't leave like this. Look.

01:10:32.486 --> 01:10:33.821
Kate!

01:10:33.957 --> 01:10:35.989
Where you going?

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.822
Mama, it's me.

01:12:15.721 --> 01:12:16.760
Kate?

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:20.159
What happened?

01:12:20.968 --> 01:12:22.029
What...

01:12:34.078 --> 01:12:37.979
I am sorry
there's so much junk in here.

01:12:39.785 --> 01:12:41.389
I'll clear it out
for you tomorrow.

01:12:43.318 --> 01:12:47.154
And your friend Javi stopped by
a few weeks back.

01:12:47.289 --> 01:12:49.760
Almost didn't recognize him
with the haircut.

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:53.258
You chasing again?

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:54.869
No.

01:13:07.512 --> 01:13:08.680
Do you need anything?

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:11.177
No, I'm fine.

01:13:12.151 --> 01:13:13.151
Okay.

01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:18.393
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:13:37.178 --> 01:13:38.413
Here we are.

01:13:39.746 --> 01:13:41.244
Oh, hello!
Hello.

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.380
Hello!

01:13:42.416 --> 01:13:44.045
Ahoy!
Ahoy!

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.285
Kate is doing some work,
as always.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.147
Where is she? Show yourself.

01:13:49.283 --> 01:13:51.152
- Isn't she cute?
- What are you doing?

01:13:51.288 --> 01:13:53.391
I'm just doing a little
video tour of the barn,

01:13:53.527 --> 01:13:55.386
where we do most of our work.

01:13:55.522 --> 01:13:59.130
This is Kate's famous
middle school project.

01:13:59.265 --> 01:14:00.928
Whoo-hoo.

01:14:01.063 --> 01:14:02.371
What is it
you're working on, Kate?

01:14:02.395 --> 01:14:05.570
- Tell the folks.
- Uh, cloud microphysics.

01:14:05.705 --> 01:14:07.165
Say again? Cloud mic...

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.006
Cloud microphysics.
Guys.

01:14:09.142 --> 01:14:10.908
This is what I have to
put up with...

01:14:11.043 --> 01:14:13.441
when you're dating someone
who's very bright.

01:14:13.576 --> 01:14:14.576
Gorgeous?

01:14:14.646 --> 01:14:15.976
- Hey, Jeb?
- Yeah?

01:14:16.112 --> 01:14:17.396
- What are we gonna do tomorrow?
- Today?

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.382
Uh-uh, tomorrow.
What are we doing?

01:14:19.517 --> 01:14:21.027
We're going chasing... Uh, we're
gonna kill a tornado, right?

01:14:21.051 --> 01:14:22.651
We're gonna be...
We're taming a tornado.

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:24.918
- We're taming a tornado?
- We're taming it.

01:14:25.053 --> 01:14:27.918
This is Kate's favorite slogan.

01:14:28.054 --> 01:14:29.160
"Taming a tornado."

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.892
This is...
this is what it's like

01:14:33.028 --> 01:14:34.325
to be inside a tornado, Kate.

01:14:34.461 --> 01:14:35.932
Well, I can only do it with you.

01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:45.172
How you doing?

01:14:46.908 --> 01:14:49.049
Just the way I left it.

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:51.842
I've been wondering what you want
me to do with all this stuff.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.951
You can just throw it out.

01:14:57.126 --> 01:14:59.527
You done? Hmm?

01:15:01.995 --> 01:15:05.232
It's funny, I keep seeing
more and more tornadoes

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:07.964
and floods and droughts and...

01:15:08.099 --> 01:15:11.539
price of wheat and seed
going up and up and up.

01:15:15.805 --> 01:15:17.006
But I'm still here.

01:15:18.344 --> 01:15:19.679
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:15:23.486 --> 01:15:25.014
I haven't been good
about calling.

01:15:27.785 --> 01:15:30.221
I've got to get this. Um...

01:15:30.356 --> 01:15:32.318
"Throw it away."

01:15:32.454 --> 01:15:34.958
I'm still waiting for you
to save the world.

01:15:57.246 --> 01:15:59.851
Build your own tornado.
Look at that.

01:16:01.855 --> 01:16:03.690
Middle school
science fair project.

01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:07.023
Well, you must've won.

01:16:14.599 --> 01:16:15.599
How'd you find me?

01:16:15.735 --> 01:16:17.297
Uh, Dexter pieced it together.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.760
He remembered your name
from the news a few years back.

01:16:26.042 --> 01:16:27.538
I'm sorry about your friends.

01:16:30.546 --> 01:16:32.784
I'm fixing some food.
You two okay eating outside?

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.521
Oh, I'm not gonna
bother you, Ms. Carter.

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:36.080
- He's not staying.
- He's staying.

01:16:36.215 --> 01:16:37.525
You can call me Cathy.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:39.100
Kate, why don't you set up
the table?

01:16:41.928 --> 01:16:43.123
That only gets you so far,

01:16:43.259 --> 01:16:45.633
and every chaser
has to make a guess,

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:47.346
and the good ones have
an instinct for it.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.734
Oh, she had that early on.

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:51.304
Always knew
when weather was coming,

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.971
even better than the cows.

01:16:53.106 --> 01:16:55.169
Wow, you hear that?
You're better than the cows.

01:16:55.305 --> 01:16:57.409
That's a compliment.

01:16:57.545 --> 01:16:59.309
Got to have a feel for it.

01:16:59.444 --> 01:17:01.057
She always had a feel for it, huh?
Oh, yeah.

01:17:01.081 --> 01:17:03.242
One time,
I was giving her a bath...

01:17:03.378 --> 01:17:04.984
- Can we not?
- Maybe just a little.

01:17:05.119 --> 01:17:08.519
And we heard thunder,
and she shot up out of the tub

01:17:08.654 --> 01:17:10.419
and ran out the house

01:17:10.554 --> 01:17:12.314
naked as the day she was born...
Oh, my God.

01:17:12.391 --> 01:17:13.732
And I had no idea where she w...

01:17:13.756 --> 01:17:15.090
I was terrified.

01:17:15.226 --> 01:17:17.523
And when I finally
caught up with her,

01:17:17.659 --> 01:17:20.030
she was standing in
the middle of the wheat field,

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:23.001
staring at the sky.

01:17:23.136 --> 01:17:25.345
- I got to try that out.
- Will you stop encouraging her?

01:17:25.369 --> 01:17:27.249
Keep your clothes on, Kate.
Let your mom finish.

01:17:27.305 --> 01:17:29.974
All I'm saying is,
she always loved weather.

01:17:31.572 --> 01:17:33.340
Worse the weather,
the happier the girl.

01:17:36.647 --> 01:17:37.981
What about you?

01:17:38.117 --> 01:17:39.597
Tyler, how'd you come
to do this work?

01:17:42.316 --> 01:17:43.989
Well, when you love something,

01:17:44.124 --> 01:17:46.204
you'll spend your whole life
trying to understand it.

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:49.987
Katie was studying for a PhD.

01:17:50.122 --> 01:17:52.096
Wow.

01:17:52.231 --> 01:17:54.191
I keep telling her
to come back and finish it.

01:17:54.326 --> 01:17:55.869
Okay, Mom.

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.614
She was heading up a big study
with her friends:

01:17:57.638 --> 01:18:00.166
disrupting tornado dynamics.

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.301
Uh, does anybody need anything?

01:18:02.437 --> 01:18:05.045
Nah, I'm...
I'm good, thank you.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.307
'Kay.

01:18:08.975 --> 01:18:10.976
Once-in-a-generation
tornado outbreak continues

01:18:11.112 --> 01:18:12.411
across Oklahoma.

01:18:12.547 --> 01:18:14.351
After that EF4
that hit Stillwater,

01:18:14.487 --> 01:18:16.853
the state will continue to see
more devastating effects...

01:18:16.988 --> 01:18:18.884
The Sooner State is bracing

01:18:19.019 --> 01:18:21.093
for increasingly
violent tornado...

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:23.927
I invited Tyler to stay
the night in the guest room.

01:18:24.063 --> 01:18:25.425
Mom.

01:18:34.008 --> 01:18:36.636
You thought
you could disrupt a tornado.

01:18:36.772 --> 01:18:39.645
- Hey, don't look at that.
- Oh, you're the OG Wrangler.

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:40.922
Tyler, can you give that to me?

01:18:40.946 --> 01:18:42.146
"Using superabsorbent polymers

01:18:42.278 --> 01:18:44.049
to reduce moisture
in the updraft,

01:18:44.185 --> 01:18:45.011
- trying to collapse it like a house of cards."
- Tyler.

01:18:45.146 --> 01:18:46.711
I mean, you'd have to

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:48.692
drop a silo of it in a funnel
for any real effect.

01:18:48.716 --> 01:18:50.164
Well, yeah, that's why
we were trying to use

01:18:50.188 --> 01:18:52.025
different reagents
to enhance it.

01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:53.829
- It's a dumb idea.
- Yeah, some of your reactants are off.

01:18:53.853 --> 01:18:55.413
A few of these
solubility rules skew...

01:18:55.626 --> 01:18:57.158
What?

01:18:57.294 --> 01:18:58.368
You really think
I'm an idiot, don't you?

01:18:58.392 --> 01:18:59.932
No, I don't think you're an...

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.868
- Hey, modeling's got so much better.
- Tyler.

01:19:01.995 --> 01:19:03.473
I can upload this to my laptop,
link up with a supercomputer.

01:19:03.497 --> 01:19:05.137
- No, no...
- I'm telling you,

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:06.808
- we can get a new model running.
- That's okay.

01:19:06.832 --> 01:19:08.249
- Please, can you stop?
- It's a great idea.

01:19:08.273 --> 01:19:09.067
How did you not tell me
about this before?

01:19:09.203 --> 01:19:10.203
Because I got it wrong!

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.307
In the field, in the moment,

01:19:14.442 --> 01:19:17.411
when it mattered,
I got it wrong.

01:19:17.546 --> 01:19:19.386
Okay, I underestimated
what we were up against,

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:21.078
and I pushed it too far.

01:19:21.214 --> 01:19:22.717
And for what?

01:19:24.622 --> 01:19:26.862
Some childish dream I had
that I could make a difference?

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:29.720
It was never gonna work.

01:19:32.892 --> 01:19:35.902
And I h... I have to live
with that forever.

01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:55.283
You know, uh, EF1 or EF5
tornado rating...

01:19:55.418 --> 01:19:57.154
it's not based on size
or wind speed.

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:00.124
The power we ascribe to it,

01:20:01.629 --> 01:20:03.921
it's based on damage.

01:20:04.057 --> 01:20:08.264
Now, it's only after the fact
we can really define it.

01:20:08.399 --> 01:20:11.300
What it destroys,
what it takes from us.

01:20:13.499 --> 01:20:15.172
I'm sorry for what happened.

01:20:17.844 --> 01:20:19.275
But how much more

01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:21.090
are you gonna let this thing
take from you?

01:20:29.088 --> 01:20:30.182
You know, you should...

01:20:30.318 --> 01:20:31.782
you should get some sleep.

01:20:33.556 --> 01:20:35.076
Don't want to miss
any storms tomorrow.

01:22:14.723 --> 01:22:16.403
You said you could get
a new model running?

01:22:19.259 --> 01:22:20.429
Yes, ma'am.

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:26.631
So this is an EF1,
perfect conditions.

01:22:26.767 --> 01:22:29.503
Run your experiment,
see if it works.

01:22:29.638 --> 01:22:33.076
Okay, so, um,
1,500 kilos of polymer

01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:35.575
absorbing 300 times its weight.

01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:38.877
So, it's, uh, 450,000 kilos

01:22:39.012 --> 01:22:42.148
of precipitation loaded into
our water-filled polymer

01:22:42.284 --> 01:22:43.982
to load the updraft.

01:22:44.118 --> 01:22:45.752
Let's see
how the model responds.

01:22:45.887 --> 01:22:47.660
Buoyancy of
the rising air is reducing.

01:22:47.795 --> 01:22:49.920
It's reducing.

01:22:50.055 --> 01:22:51.775
- Slowing the updraft.
- Temp is going down.

01:22:52.535 --> 01:22:53.535
Kate?

01:22:55.268 --> 01:22:57.070
Kate, in theory,
this should've worked.

01:22:59.772 --> 01:23:00.772
In theory.

01:23:03.406 --> 01:23:04.801
But it wasn't an EF1 that day.

01:23:04.937 --> 01:23:07.509
I mean...
we never had a chance.

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:10.684
You want one?

01:23:22.662 --> 01:23:24.362
Yeah, that's my radio.
What's all this for?

01:23:24.497 --> 01:23:26.360
Wait, what are you touching
back there? Stop.

01:23:26.496 --> 01:23:28.064
You have a lot of stuff in here.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.400
Yeah, that... that's a mirror.

01:23:30.769 --> 01:23:32.469
Oh, God.

01:23:32.605 --> 01:23:34.735
- Ooh.
- Have you ever been in a car before?

01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:36.990
- You got a lot of gadgets.
- Yeah, yeah, don't touch.

01:23:37.036 --> 01:23:38.385
There's... there's guards there
for a reason.

01:23:38.409 --> 01:23:39.689
- What do these do?
- That's a...

01:23:39.772 --> 01:23:41.506
Oh! God.

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:42.513
- Sorry.
- That's a rocket.

01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:44.217
Yep.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.586
All right, what about
these two little ones?

01:23:45.610 --> 01:23:47.354
Just west of Enid.

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:49.980
Yeah, but this one to the east
has the sky all to herself.

01:23:51.522 --> 01:23:52.962
Yeah, I'm not falling
for that again.

01:23:56.829 --> 01:23:57.829
You serious?

01:23:58.765 --> 01:24:00.562
Tell you later.

01:24:09.641 --> 01:24:11.837
Dew point is steady!
Wind shear is good!

01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:14.004
Holy shit!

01:24:14.139 --> 01:24:16.009
Oh, my God,
the whole updraft is rotating!

01:24:16.145 --> 01:24:18.777
Holy cow! I mean, look
at those striations!

01:24:18.912 --> 01:24:21.054
It's low precip!
You can see everything!

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:23.420
- Aw, she's perfect!
- She's gorgeous.

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:32.691
She's gonna give us something!
Come on!

01:24:42.001 --> 01:24:43.675
All right, let's harness up.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.820
Uh, we're just gonna drop
the trailer in its path, right?

01:24:48.641 --> 01:24:49.911
I'll tell you later.

01:24:50.046 --> 01:24:51.215
Shit.

01:24:58.688 --> 01:24:59.517
Well, you don't
have to drive into it.

01:24:59.652 --> 01:25:00.918
It's really dangerous.

01:25:01.053 --> 01:25:02.689
Oh, that's why
we have to drive into it.

01:25:02.824 --> 01:25:04.359
- Can't miss from in there.
- Oh, shit.

01:25:16.535 --> 01:25:18.420
- Now, look, this thing's rated for EF1s, okay?
- Oh, shit.

01:25:18.444 --> 01:25:20.147
We got extra weight
on the chassis.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.611
We got anchoring down two feet.
Don't worry.

01:25:22.746 --> 01:25:24.386
- I'm a professional.
- You're an asshole.

01:25:24.485 --> 01:25:26.450
- Hold on. Hold on!
- Oh, Tyler, this is dumb.

01:25:26.585 --> 01:25:28.124
This is really dumb.
This is really dumb.

01:25:28.148 --> 01:25:29.464
Uh-huh, all right.
We got this, Kate.

01:25:29.488 --> 01:25:31.182
- Here comes the kick!
- Oh, God!

01:25:34.127 --> 01:25:36.095
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:38.022
Oh.
All right, slowing down.

01:25:41.395 --> 01:25:42.433
Anchoring.

01:25:44.067 --> 01:25:45.304
Barrels.

01:25:45.805 --> 01:25:46.805
Hold on.

01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:53.409
Oh! Here she comes.

01:25:58.812 --> 01:26:00.253
Now!

01:26:29.283 --> 01:26:31.218
- Did you see that?
- I saw it.

01:26:32.815 --> 01:26:34.654
- Holy...
- Uh, did it work?

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:36.047
Oh, right. Uh...

01:26:37.991 --> 01:26:39.424
So many belts.

01:26:47.836 --> 01:26:48.895
It's not working.

01:26:52.103 --> 01:26:53.103
Hungry?

01:26:57.973 --> 01:26:59.906
What if it's the model
that's the problem?

01:27:03.613 --> 01:27:04.878
How do we create a better one?

01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:26.968
Hey, uh...

01:27:27.103 --> 01:27:29.203
about what I said earlier,
I didn't mean any of that.

01:27:29.338 --> 01:27:31.071
It's fine.

01:27:31.207 --> 01:27:33.610
If there's anything I can say
or do to make it better...

01:27:36.582 --> 01:27:38.109
Give me your PAR data.
That's a start.

01:27:51.428 --> 01:27:52.431
What are you doing?

01:27:55.569 --> 01:27:57.409
I'm giving this to her.
What does it look like?

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:07.446
I needed money
to start StormPAR.

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:10.106
That's why I went
into business with Riggs.

01:28:10.242 --> 01:28:11.521
I want to help people,
too, Kate.

01:28:11.545 --> 01:28:12.545
I really do.

01:28:13.617 --> 01:28:15.289
I said what I said 'cause I...

01:28:16.919 --> 01:28:18.199
I carry that guilt with me, too.

01:28:19.988 --> 01:28:21.592
Every single day
of my life, so...

01:28:23.326 --> 01:28:25.297
I'm sorry.

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:28.699
Javi, why don't you stay
and help us?

01:28:28.834 --> 01:28:30.674
That way, we could
finally solve this together.

01:28:38.242 --> 01:28:40.682
You know, there was a time when
I'd do anything for you, Kate.

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:47.981
Javi.
Let's roll.

01:28:48.116 --> 01:28:49.646
We got a storm developing
up near Enid.

01:28:49.781 --> 01:28:50.816
Team's waiting.

01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:52.755
I got to get back to work.

01:28:52.890 --> 01:28:54.955
The more data I get,
the better for business.

01:29:00.134 --> 01:29:01.434
Sorry I stole your car.

01:29:02.497 --> 01:29:03.497
It's all right.

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:05.768
Look...

01:29:07.603 --> 01:29:08.705
Be careful out there.

01:29:20.313 --> 01:29:22.148
Wow, these scans are impressive.

01:29:22.283 --> 01:29:25.083
I mean, it's
a complete map of the chaos.

01:29:25.218 --> 01:29:29.026
Tyler, our moisture numbers
are off.

01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:32.155
Currently, the polymer is only
absorbing the existing raindrops,

01:29:32.290 --> 01:29:33.650
not the moisture
from the humidity.

01:29:33.733 --> 01:29:36.663
I mean, we need it
to precipitate out more.

01:29:36.798 --> 01:29:39.033
So we need to make it rain.

01:29:39.168 --> 01:29:41.236
They were cloud seeding
in Lawton a few years ago

01:29:41.371 --> 01:29:42.503
for the farmers.

01:29:42.639 --> 01:29:44.103
Yeah. Yeah, silver iodide.

01:29:45.478 --> 01:29:48.548
We could shoot rockets of that.

01:29:48.684 --> 01:29:52.009
So, the silver iodide converts
the moisture into rain,

01:29:52.144 --> 01:29:53.514
and then
the sodium polyacrylate,

01:29:53.649 --> 01:29:54.881
we need a lot of it...

01:29:55.017 --> 01:29:56.687
would pull the water
from the storm,

01:29:57.654 --> 01:29:59.919
increasing the cold pool.

01:30:00.055 --> 01:30:01.923
No faster way
to choke a tornado.

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:04.526
Hey, Lily.

01:30:04.661 --> 01:30:06.763
Yeah, I couldn't get Boone.

01:30:06.898 --> 01:30:08.618
No, we're gonna need you guys
for something.

01:30:10.129 --> 01:30:11.728
No, no, no. We'll come to you.

01:30:11.863 --> 01:30:12.901
All right.

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:17.103
Is this it?

01:30:17.238 --> 01:30:18.780
Or you gonna come back
before you go home?

01:30:18.804 --> 01:30:19.842
You know I will.

01:30:22.415 --> 01:30:23.945
- Love you.
- Love you.

01:30:25.283 --> 01:30:27.587
This is for you.

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:29.762
You have any idea what
you're getting yourself into?

01:30:30.388 --> 01:30:31.388
I'm beginning to.

01:30:37.856 --> 01:30:39.626
Huh. Thanks.

01:30:39.761 --> 01:30:41.468
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:30:58.382 --> 01:30:59.409
Oh, Lord.

01:31:00.617 --> 01:31:01.715
You finally made it.

01:31:01.851 --> 01:31:03.953
Ben, you stuck around.

01:31:04.089 --> 01:31:06.291
Turns out, there's more
to this story than I thought.

01:31:06.426 --> 01:31:07.756
We got a new ending for you.

01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:09.292
Look who it is. City girl.

01:31:09.428 --> 01:31:10.893
What's up, Kate?

01:31:11.029 --> 01:31:12.605
Finally decided to ditch
all those squares, huh?

01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:14.061
Right on.

01:31:14.196 --> 01:31:16.300
Mm-hmm. Yep.
Y'all missed a big one. Look.

01:31:16.436 --> 01:31:18.267
- Oh, wow.
- See?

01:31:18.402 --> 01:31:21.666
Hey, can you, um... Can you
rig that drone to collect data?

01:31:21.802 --> 01:31:23.400
I can do that.

01:31:23.536 --> 01:31:25.078
Yeah, she can do that.
Easy. Easy.

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:28.307
Hey, buddy. I'm sorry.

01:31:28.442 --> 01:31:30.562
- How do I make it up to you?
- Man, you abandoned me.

01:31:30.684 --> 01:31:32.124
I don't know nothing
about no makeup.

01:31:32.148 --> 01:31:33.883
How about we launch
some new rockets?

01:31:36.487 --> 01:31:37.854
You said rockets?

01:31:38.588 --> 01:31:41.521
Hey. Y'all ready?

01:31:41.657 --> 01:31:43.938
We need a 40-foot trailer
that's light enough for a pickup

01:31:43.988 --> 01:31:47.994
but heavy enough to anchor
barrels in 100-mile-an-hour winds.

01:31:48.130 --> 01:31:49.503
Why the hell
would you want that?

01:31:53.166 --> 01:31:54.639
Why the hell do we want that?

01:31:54.775 --> 01:31:56.411
Well, 'cause when we drive
into a tornado,

01:31:56.435 --> 01:31:57.715
we want whatever's
on the trailer

01:31:57.810 --> 01:31:59.172
to get sucked into it,
but not us.

01:32:01.008 --> 01:32:02.376
You're gonna want aluminum.

01:32:02.511 --> 01:32:03.511
Okay.

01:32:05.983 --> 01:32:08.379
Dexter, talk to me.
What's going on?

01:32:08.515 --> 01:32:10.949
Testing the Goldilocks
principle of a tornado

01:32:11.084 --> 01:32:12.491
by modifying the variables,

01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:14.127
hopefully disrupting
the process.

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:15.392
Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:32:15.528 --> 01:32:17.054
Dani, what does that mean?

01:32:17.190 --> 01:32:18.862
- Taming the storm.
- Right.

01:32:21.094 --> 01:32:22.392
T, tell us what's going on.

01:32:22.528 --> 01:32:24.048
All right,
we're gonna shoot the clouds

01:32:24.098 --> 01:32:25.362
with rockets of silver iodide.

01:32:25.497 --> 01:32:27.036
Yeah, makes 'em rain, right?

01:32:27.171 --> 01:32:29.005
Yep. Rain is
what we need in the updraft.

01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:31.538
And then we're gonna take
the sodium polyacrylate

01:32:31.673 --> 01:32:34.073
and we're gonna deliver it in the vortex...
Don't touch that.

01:32:35.482 --> 01:32:36.911
Increasing the cold pool.

01:32:37.047 --> 01:32:39.745
And that does what
to the tornado?

01:32:39.881 --> 01:32:40.881
Cuts the fuel, Ben.

01:32:41.849 --> 01:32:43.382
Lily.

01:32:43.517 --> 01:32:45.457
Oh, look at Cairo
looking all cute and whatnot.

01:32:45.592 --> 01:32:46.592
Hey, buddy.

01:33:26.565 --> 01:33:28.091
She is your story, Ben.

01:33:34.969 --> 01:33:36.137
Get me a copy of that.

01:33:37.774 --> 01:33:39.008
Let's get out of here.

01:33:42.612 --> 01:33:46.785
Uh, no offense, but I'm gonna
get a ride with someone else.

01:34:09.441 --> 01:34:10.571
That's it.

01:34:10.706 --> 01:34:11.973
Hell yeah.

01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:14.477
- We got it. We got it.
- All right.

01:34:23.617 --> 01:34:25.786
Okay, ground speed's at 22.
Intercept is northeast.

01:34:25.921 --> 01:34:27.419
Look for Siloam Road.

01:34:28.592 --> 01:34:29.592
Siloam Road.

01:34:37.968 --> 01:34:39.870
Whoa, whoa!

01:34:40.005 --> 01:34:41.533
- Come on!
- Hey, what are you doing?

01:34:41.668 --> 01:34:44.502
Hey! These storm buttheads
are cutting us off, man.

01:34:47.274 --> 01:34:48.538
I told you we didn't need her.

01:34:48.673 --> 01:34:50.376
All right,
let's not get distracted.

01:34:52.116 --> 01:34:53.720
Let's get these babies
in the air!

01:35:05.932 --> 01:35:07.996
I can't see it right now.
I lost it.

01:35:08.132 --> 01:35:09.292
It's tracking straight ahead.

01:35:09.336 --> 01:35:10.503
I'd say push it.

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:11.918
Get ahead of it,
get ahead of it.

01:35:22.977 --> 01:35:24.310
Doppler went dark.

01:35:24.446 --> 01:35:25.911
That's probably
a dead cell zone.

01:35:26.047 --> 01:35:27.721
Lily, are you above us?

01:35:29.054 --> 01:35:30.652
It's getting
completely rain-wrapped.

01:35:30.788 --> 01:35:32.088
I can't see a thing.

01:35:35.392 --> 01:35:37.192
We just got to push through
this rain curtain.

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:38.264
Oh.

01:35:41.602 --> 01:35:43.192
Yeah, I just lost my drone.

01:35:43.328 --> 01:35:44.599
Hey, we lost visual.

01:35:57.078 --> 01:35:58.577
I can't see anything.

01:35:58.712 --> 01:36:00.152
That's all right.
Just keep straight.

01:36:00.185 --> 01:36:01.224
I can see the road.
You see the road?

01:36:01.248 --> 01:36:02.546
This feels different.

01:36:02.681 --> 01:36:04.198
I'm telling you,
I think we should stop.

01:36:04.222 --> 01:36:05.528
Just keep going.
We'll get ahead of it.

01:36:05.552 --> 01:36:06.836
- Scott, we have to stop!
- Keep going!

01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:08.260
- We'll get ahead of it!
- Oh, shit!

01:36:09.227 --> 01:36:10.333
Oh, God! It's right there!

01:36:10.357 --> 01:36:11.792
It's right there! Right there!

01:36:11.928 --> 01:36:14.023
Get down! Get down!

01:36:14.158 --> 01:36:15.158
Javi!

01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.366
Oh, God.

01:36:23.237 --> 01:36:25.370
- Oh!
- Hold on, y'all.

01:36:25.506 --> 01:36:26.712
Tyler, we got to do something.

01:36:26.848 --> 01:36:28.409
Hey!
On your left, guys!

01:36:28.545 --> 01:36:29.816
It's hitting something big!

01:36:31.249 --> 01:36:33.281
Oh, my God.

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:43.687
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:36:43.823 --> 01:36:45.826
Wait, wait, wait.
We can't just leave them.

01:36:45.961 --> 01:36:48.441
We're not gonna leave them, but
we got to move! We got to move!

01:36:49.934 --> 01:36:51.798
Back up, back up, back up!

01:36:51.933 --> 01:36:53.636
Dex! Go! Go!

01:36:53.772 --> 01:36:55.435
It's flying at us, man!

01:36:55.570 --> 01:36:56.890
Go faster!
I'm going, I'm going!

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:07.546
Oh!

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:12.458
Javi.

01:37:27.803 --> 01:37:28.803
Oh, God.

01:37:29.244 --> 01:37:30.244
Hang on.

01:37:39.317 --> 01:37:41.415
Come on, come on.
Hang on, Scott.

01:37:45.285 --> 01:37:46.519
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:37:50.632 --> 01:37:51.997
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:38:10.474 --> 01:38:11.841
Is everybody okay?

01:38:12.650 --> 01:38:14.249
Yeah.

01:38:14.385 --> 01:38:16.052
We're okay.
Yeah, we're good, man.

01:38:16.188 --> 01:38:18.056
- We're moving.
- Are you seeing this?

01:38:20.487 --> 01:38:22.390
Look at the size of that thing.

01:38:23.663 --> 01:38:24.663
This is good.

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:27.667
No, that ain't good.

01:38:28.667 --> 01:38:29.667
That ain't good.

01:38:30.967 --> 01:38:32.433
It's shifting.

01:38:48.045 --> 01:38:49.324
All right, that's it.
That's the game.

01:38:49.348 --> 01:38:50.448
Get off the field!

01:38:58.629 --> 01:39:00.630
Okay, guys, there's nothing
we can do to stop it,

01:39:00.765 --> 01:39:03.045
but when you get there, make
sure people get to a safe place.

01:39:03.069 --> 01:39:04.429
All right, Dani,
where am I headed?

01:39:06.098 --> 01:39:08.041
There's... there's a...
There's a kids' park on Main.

01:39:08.065 --> 01:39:09.505
Make sure to get people
to basements,

01:39:09.601 --> 01:39:11.308
uh, big buildings, no windows.

01:39:11.443 --> 01:39:14.140
Stay away from windows.
No cars, all right?

01:39:14.276 --> 01:39:15.807
All right, careful, y'all.

01:39:15.942 --> 01:39:17.445
Stay safe out there. Copy.

01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:20.491
Wizard, come to us.
We're gonna...

01:39:20.515 --> 01:39:21.312
We're gonna find a new position,

01:39:21.447 --> 01:39:22.648
put these radars down.

01:39:37.533 --> 01:39:39.093
They're running from it.
They're scared.

01:39:40.367 --> 01:39:42.105
They're not running.

01:39:42.241 --> 01:39:43.735
They're heading into town
to help.

01:39:45.339 --> 01:39:46.971
Look, we got to go, too.

01:39:47.106 --> 01:39:49.008
No, we got our access
road here, on the left.

01:39:49.144 --> 01:39:50.622
- Coming up.
- Nah, man, there's a lot of people there, man.

01:39:50.646 --> 01:39:51.718
We got... I think
we should follow 'em.

01:39:51.742 --> 01:39:53.813
Whose side are you on, man?

01:39:53.949 --> 01:39:56.218
You want to go hang out with
your little girlfriend? Go.

01:39:56.354 --> 01:39:57.782
But we got the team
waiting for us,

01:39:57.917 --> 01:39:59.637
and we got the storm
of a century out there!

01:39:59.691 --> 01:40:01.504
- What are you talking about?
- Slow down, stop the tr...

01:40:01.528 --> 01:40:03.173
- The people! There's people!
- I don't care about the people!

01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:05.289
Stop the truck, Javi!
We're planting here!

01:40:05.425 --> 01:40:06.425
We need to go help!

01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.391
Javi, stop the damn truck!

01:40:14.003 --> 01:40:15.003
Good choice.

01:40:17.404 --> 01:40:19.311
Tell Riggs we're done!

01:40:21.143 --> 01:40:22.378
Damn it, Javi!

01:40:27.284 --> 01:40:28.615
All right, run to your mom.

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:34.219
Hey, everyone!
Get inside, all right?

01:40:34.355 --> 01:40:35.687
Guys, let's go, go, go!

01:40:35.823 --> 01:40:37.303
There's a shelter down there!
Come on!

01:40:37.363 --> 01:40:39.391
Hey, no!
Leave your cars! Get inside!

01:40:39.526 --> 01:40:41.627
It's not safe here! Come on!

01:40:41.763 --> 01:40:43.523
- Hey! Everyone, go inside!
- Let's go, guys.

01:41:07.519 --> 01:41:08.592
Guys!

01:41:08.727 --> 01:41:09.861
Tyler!

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:12.197
Tyler! Shelters are all full!

01:41:12.333 --> 01:41:14.053
We got to get everyone
to the movie theater!

01:41:14.164 --> 01:41:15.762
Move! Everybody inside!

01:41:15.898 --> 01:41:17.544
Sir, sir, you got to leave it.
You got to leave it.

01:41:17.568 --> 01:41:19.028
Leave it, leave it!
Come on, come on!

01:41:19.163 --> 01:41:20.830
Let it go, let it go!
Come on, come on!

01:41:20.966 --> 01:41:22.907
Guys, it's here!
You got to get inside!

01:41:26.337 --> 01:41:28.840
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

01:41:31.417 --> 01:41:33.413
Come on. We're almost there.
I got you.

01:41:33.548 --> 01:41:35.517
Come on! Get in, get in!
Come on!

01:41:37.853 --> 01:41:40.055
Come on, come on!
You got to go! It's here!

01:41:40.190 --> 01:41:41.784
Get inside, everybody!

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.460
Come on!

01:41:59.745 --> 01:42:01.140
Tyler!

01:42:04.079 --> 01:42:05.079
Okay.

01:42:07.049 --> 01:42:08.286
Come on.

01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:23.235
Watch out!

01:42:27.198 --> 01:42:29.835
- You got to get inside!
- I'm not leaving you!

01:42:31.744 --> 01:42:32.744
Kate.

01:42:37.643 --> 01:42:39.185
Come on, Kate! Lift!

01:42:40.083 --> 01:42:41.083
Okay.

01:42:43.124 --> 01:42:44.364
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on!

01:43:11.844 --> 01:43:13.742
See if you can find a basement!

01:43:13.878 --> 01:43:15.478
I'll check the other side!

01:43:29.964 --> 01:43:31.499
There's no basement
on the other side!

01:43:31.634 --> 01:43:33.230
There's nothing
over here either!

01:43:33.365 --> 01:43:35.802
This theater isn't built
to withstand what's coming!

01:43:51.683 --> 01:43:52.750
There you go.

01:43:52.885 --> 01:43:53.925
- You got her?
- I got her.

01:43:57.227 --> 01:43:58.231
Where's Kate?

01:44:39.003 --> 01:44:40.229
Kate!

01:44:41.566 --> 01:44:42.566
Kate!

01:44:48.245 --> 01:44:49.245
Where's Kate?

01:45:57.248 --> 01:45:58.315
No, Kate!

01:45:58.450 --> 01:45:59.710
- Tyler! Tyler!
- Kate! Kate!

01:45:59.846 --> 01:46:01.354
- Tyler!
- Get him in!

01:46:04.156 --> 01:46:05.156
Doors!

01:46:13.966 --> 01:46:14.966
Damn!

01:46:21.806 --> 01:46:23.502
Stay down, stay down, stay down!

01:46:23.638 --> 01:46:25.169
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

01:46:25.304 --> 01:46:27.071
That way, that way!
You have to get down!

01:46:27.207 --> 01:46:28.290
- Get down!
- That's it. Don't look back.

01:46:28.314 --> 01:46:29.434
Don't look back. Keep going.

01:46:31.483 --> 01:46:33.212
We got to get these people...

01:46:33.348 --> 01:46:35.811
We got to help get these people
to the back of the theater.

01:46:35.947 --> 01:46:37.583
Tyler, come on. Come on!

01:46:37.718 --> 01:46:39.716
Hey. We got to go, T.

01:46:39.851 --> 01:46:40.987
Come on. Come on.

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.866
Okay.

01:46:59.339 --> 01:47:00.737
Come on, come on, come on.

01:47:06.014 --> 01:47:07.317
Take my hand.
You got to get up.

01:47:07.453 --> 01:47:10.484
Get back! Get back! Get back!

01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:11.818
You're okay, you're okay.

01:47:11.953 --> 01:47:12.993
Slow it down.
Hold tight!

01:47:13.017 --> 01:47:14.086
Get down, get down!

01:47:15.961 --> 01:47:17.986
Push in, push in!
It's alive.

01:47:18.122 --> 01:47:19.561
It's alive! It's alive!

01:47:19.696 --> 01:47:21.295
It's alive!
Hold on!

01:47:30.638 --> 01:47:32.110
Come on. Come on.

01:48:52.854 --> 01:48:55.521
Lily! No!

01:48:55.657 --> 01:48:57.156
Tyler! Tyler!

01:49:00.090 --> 01:49:02.293
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go.
I got you!

01:49:25.755 --> 01:49:28.022
Thank you.

01:49:35.327 --> 01:49:37.002
- Are you all right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:49:37.137 --> 01:49:38.230
You okay?

01:50:20.774 --> 01:50:21.774
Kate.

01:50:22.975 --> 01:50:23.975
Kate.

01:50:24.107 --> 01:50:25.315
Careful.

01:50:25.450 --> 01:50:26.583
You okay?

01:50:26.719 --> 01:50:28.015
Easy.

01:50:28.151 --> 01:50:29.351
Is everyone okay?
Easy, easy.

01:50:31.081 --> 01:50:32.081
Is it okay?

01:50:35.828 --> 01:50:37.993
- Did it help?
- You did it, Kate.

01:50:38.891 --> 01:50:39.962
You did it.

01:50:42.032 --> 01:50:43.636
Kate, it worked.

01:50:46.371 --> 01:50:47.371
You okay?

01:50:53.775 --> 01:50:56.109
Oh, my God, that was amazing.
Oh, my God.

01:50:56.245 --> 01:50:57.974
We thought you were
a goner for sure.

01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:59.115
You're brilliant.

01:50:59.251 --> 01:51:00.911
Mm-hmm.

01:51:01.047 --> 01:51:02.450
I think I love you.

01:51:04.088 --> 01:51:05.781
I thought for certain
I was gonna fly.

01:51:05.917 --> 01:51:07.791
No, you did fly.
Honestly.

01:51:22.437 --> 01:51:24.810
Door-to-door service,
just like I promised.

01:51:24.945 --> 01:51:27.475
- Brought you back in one piece.
- Yeah, just about.

01:51:30.346 --> 01:51:32.676
Look, when you get to New York,
with the review board,

01:51:32.812 --> 01:51:35.247
they're gonna say that it was
the fire from the refinery

01:51:35.383 --> 01:51:37.154
or the smoke
or a million other things

01:51:37.289 --> 01:51:39.196
that caused that tornado to
vanish, and that's fine, too.

01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:40.460
But the point is,
is that we know

01:51:40.484 --> 01:51:41.892
these things can be disrupted,

01:51:42.027 --> 01:51:43.166
and we need
a whole new branch of research

01:51:43.190 --> 01:51:45.159
on how to harness these storms.

01:51:45.294 --> 01:51:47.456
Are you sure
you don't want to do the pitch?

01:51:47.592 --> 01:51:48.961
It sounds like
you want to do it.

01:51:49.096 --> 01:51:52.167
Nah. Nah, partner.

01:51:52.302 --> 01:51:53.982
Go get us that money,
you know what I'm saying?

01:51:54.006 --> 01:51:56.874
I ditched Riggs, all right?
Fresh start.

01:51:57.009 --> 01:51:58.609
Maybe it's time to renovate
the old barn.

01:51:59.645 --> 01:52:01.637
I like that. I like that.

01:52:02.942 --> 01:52:04.977
Whoa, Owens!

01:52:05.113 --> 01:52:07.084
StormPAR.

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:08.220
Sapulpa.

01:52:10.385 --> 01:52:12.381
Still not telling me
when you're coming back?

01:52:12.516 --> 01:52:14.727
I don't know. This could be it.

01:52:18.765 --> 01:52:20.293
Can't tell
if you're joking or not.

01:52:23.366 --> 01:52:26.365
Well, maybe if you feel it,
you should chase it.

01:52:33.943 --> 01:52:35.643
Give me a call, all right?

01:52:35.779 --> 01:52:37.112
Let me know how it goes.

01:52:39.011 --> 01:52:40.786
Safe flight.

01:52:40.921 --> 01:52:43.217
Okay, time's up.
You got to move your car.

01:52:44.017 --> 01:52:45.087
Yo, come on, man.

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:47.419
Seriously?

01:52:49.926 --> 01:52:52.133
- Let me get a, uh, tow truck up here to departures.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:52:52.157 --> 01:52:54.696
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm-I'm gonna move.
I'm gonna move.

01:53:07.945 --> 01:53:10.310
What's going on? Move your car.

01:53:12.076 --> 01:53:13.076
Go.

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:14.880
Now.

01:53:21.929 --> 01:53:23.958
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:53:24.094 --> 01:53:25.334
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Hey.

01:53:26.926 --> 01:53:27.932
Attaboy.

01:53:42.016 --> 01:53:43.608
Due to increasing winds

01:53:43.744 --> 01:53:45.913
from a nearby storm,
please expect delays.

01:55:43.065 --> 01:55:44.795
We are professional...

01:55:44.930 --> 01:55:46.970
- Tornado Wranglers.
- Tornado Wranglers, baby.

01:55:49.605 --> 01:55:52.536
You think I'll get my own face
on a T-shirt?

01:55:52.672 --> 01:55:54.770
- That'd be cool.
- If you're lucky.

01:55:54.906 --> 01:55:56.945
That'd be really cool.
I'd wear one.

01:55:57.081 --> 01:55:58.811
- You would?
- Yeah.

01:55:58.946 --> 01:56:00.466
All right, Boone,
you take that back.
