00:00.540 --> 00:02.030
Hey!

00:02.030 --> 00:04.270
Sensei! Nagakura-sensei!

00:04.270 --> 00:08.380
Old Man Shinpachi, tell us
 more of that story already!

00:08.380 --> 00:11.630
Yeah, yeah. Hold your horses.

00:11.630 --> 00:15.410
You're on odd bunch, wanting 
to hear about the Shinsengumi.

00:15.410 --> 00:19.140
Please! Tell us about Commander 
Kondo Isami, the master swordsman!

00:19.140 --> 00:20.540
Hijikata Toshizo's better!

00:20.540 --> 00:23.360
No, Okita Soji! Okita the Prodigy!

00:23.360 --> 00:25.340
You want to hear me reminisce?

00:26.470 --> 00:32.460
In that case, have I got a story for you.
One I've never told before.

00:32.670 --> 00:34.130
Whoa!

00:34.130 --> 00:34.980
I can't wait!

00:34.980 --> 00:36.300
Yeah! All right!

00:36.300 --> 00:42.040
Oh, don't get me wrong. 
These lads won't go down in history.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.690
But I remember them all the better for it.

00:48.310 --> 00:55.450
<b>Sincerity</b>

00:53.300 --> 00:55.850

02:55.220 --> 02:57.920
Hey, this place is bustling.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.070
Excuse us.

02:59.070 --> 03:00.010
Wow.

03:00.010 --> 03:01.900
What a handsome pair.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.720
And so manly.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.520
I like the look of this place, Soji.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.410
What did I tell you, Hijikata-san?

03:08.410 --> 03:10.410
You can trust my instincts.

03:10.410 --> 03:12.500
Inside's already full up!

03:12.750 --> 03:14.740
Wait out front!

03:20.210 --> 03:21.900
Welcome.

03:21.900 --> 03:24.100
Careful. It's hot.

03:24.340 --> 03:27.680
My, what a charming young lady.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.090
Why, thank you.

03:31.470 --> 03:34.230
Hijikata-san. You're making that face again.

03:34.230 --> 03:36.200
Oh. Kids and me—

03:36.200 --> 03:39.930
Don't get along. 
I know you can't stand them.

03:39.930 --> 03:42.710
No, they can't stand me.

03:43.270 --> 03:46.500
Kids can tell when someone's no good.

03:48.850 --> 03:50.700
Iroha!

03:50.700 --> 03:52.190
C-Coming!

03:53.210 --> 03:55.420
Still, did you notice?

03:55.850 --> 03:58.910
Another old lady works at this place.

03:59.450 --> 04:00.840
That's a kid.

04:00.840 --> 04:01.480
What?

04:03.590 --> 04:04.800
Thank you for waiting.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.320
Your dango, sirs.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.630
Wow, you're right.

04:11.630 --> 04:14.320
And look at that fierce face.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.060
Are you a boy?

04:16.060 --> 04:18.830
Oh, um, yes. You see—

04:18.830 --> 04:20.110
You look great.

04:20.110 --> 04:23.390
I love it. It's as white as new-fallen snow.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.990
Thank you for saying so.

04:26.990 --> 04:28.820
Maybe I should do <i>my</i> hair like that?

04:28.820 --> 04:29.850
Forget it.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.400
Kidnappers?

04:33.220 --> 04:37.100
Yes, kidnappers. 
They're everywhere these days.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.320
I hear they only go after real young kids.

04:39.620 --> 04:42.850
My, how dreadful. 
What's the world coming to?

04:43.890 --> 04:47.360
Seats have opened up! Come on in!

04:47.940 --> 04:49.600
Really...

04:49.600 --> 04:52.870
Kyoto folks just don't like me.
 I can't imagine why.

04:52.870 --> 04:56.630
My big sister told me to 
write her once I got here,

04:56.630 --> 04:58.880
but I just can't seem to find the time.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.090
How were your dango?

05:01.560 --> 05:03.400
Oh, they were great.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.430
Glad to hear it.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.990
What's your name, boy?

05:08.990 --> 05:11.290
Nio. I'm called Nio.

05:11.290 --> 05:13.760
"Nio"? Now there's a funny name.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.360
I'm Iroha!

05:15.360 --> 05:18.370
Iroha! What a lovely name.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.870
It's nice to see siblings 
getting along so well.

05:23.870 --> 05:25.390
<i>So that's it.</i>

05:25.390 --> 05:26.960
Check please, ma'am.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.890
Hmph. Kept it to five 
dango skewers, did you?

05:30.890 --> 05:32.910
Sorry. They were delicious.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.390
Hm?

05:35.840 --> 05:39.230
That's a stylish kimono. 
Did you make it yourself?

05:39.230 --> 05:41.810
Oh, my! I'm impressed you can tell.

05:42.650 --> 05:46.610
If you don't like sweet things, 
we do boiled tofu, too.

05:48.610 --> 05:52.540
<b>Chirinuya</b>

05:48.990 --> 05:51.340
You have a good eye.

05:52.860 --> 05:56.310
I think I'll try the 
red-bean soup next time.

05:54.580 --> 05:57.620
<b>Chirinuya</b>

05:56.310 --> 05:59.740
Thank you! Come again!

05:59.740 --> 06:01.710
Better think twice about that.

06:01.710 --> 06:02.540
Huh?

06:02.930 --> 06:07.300
Their eastern accents gave them away. 
They're the guys everyone's talking about.

06:08.010 --> 06:09.680
The Miburo.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.280
A-Are you sure?

06:11.280 --> 06:13.180
Yeah, that was them all right.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.670
What's are Miburo?

06:15.680 --> 06:17.110
<b>\h\hWolves
of Mibu</b>

06:16.060 --> 06:20.690
You write it "wolves of Mibu" 
'cause a pack of 'em settled in Mibu Village.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.820
<b>\h\hWolves
of Mibu</b>

06:18.820 --> 06:20.690
<b>\h\hWolves
of Mibu</b>

06:21.020 --> 06:24.660
You know the Roshigumi? 
All those ronin from Edo?

06:24.660 --> 06:26.190
Yes, I've heard them.

06:26.590 --> 06:31.070
They came to guard the Shogun 
when he visited the city.

06:31.570 --> 06:33.570
But I thought they'd left right away.

06:33.570 --> 06:38.010
Most did. But a handful stuck around.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.610
Those are the Miburo.

06:40.610 --> 06:44.100
And word is they act 
like they own the place,

06:44.100 --> 06:48.380
cutting folks down for no reason and 
breaking into shops to rob them.

06:48.790 --> 06:51.590
Th-That does sound like trouble.

06:51.900 --> 06:54.560
It wouldn't happen 
if the Shogunate had a spine.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.190
Prices have gone up 
since the Black Ships came.

06:58.190 --> 07:00.890
So guys swing swords around 
to "expel the barbarians."

07:00.890 --> 07:06.110
Then, ruffians from out east join in,
 and suddenly, no one's safe.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.430
Anyway, better to give 'em a wide berth.

07:08.430 --> 07:10.480
Who cares?! They're damn good looking!

07:10.480 --> 07:11.360
Huh?!

07:11.360 --> 07:14.650
Okay, closing time! Get going!

07:16.580 --> 07:19.670
Honestly. Who asked them?

07:20.110 --> 07:25.840
Are they dangerous? They didn't look it.

07:35.230 --> 07:39.520
Onii, do you think the Miburo 
are really that scary?

07:40.000 --> 07:43.180
I wonder. What did you think of them, Iroha?

07:43.180 --> 07:44.470
Hm...

07:44.730 --> 07:48.630
They seemed like funny guys to me.

07:48.630 --> 07:49.700
Iroha.

07:52.110 --> 07:55.990
I think you should trust your 
own eyes and ears over rumors.

07:58.570 --> 08:00.800
That's my big brother!

08:00.800 --> 08:02.030
Don't mention it.

08:02.030 --> 08:02.930
Ow!

08:02.030 --> 08:02.930
Ow!

08:04.250 --> 08:06.500
<b>Chirinuya</b>

08:04.920 --> 08:06.510
Hello there.

08:06.510 --> 08:08.470
We're back.

08:08.790 --> 08:10.450
Come in.

08:10.910 --> 08:13.460
Oh? The place is empty today.

08:14.770 --> 08:16.760
<b>Chirinu</b>

08:15.010 --> 08:16.770
We're in a slump!

08:19.060 --> 08:20.970
Wow, look at you go.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.040
Our own red-bean soup and boiled tofu.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.270
Hooray!

08:25.670 --> 08:29.310
Ma'am, those two aren't 
brother and sister, are they?

08:30.270 --> 08:32.410
Huh? What makes you say that?

08:32.400 --> 08:36.660
Maru, Take, Ebisu, Ni, Oshi, Oike!

08:32.650 --> 08:35.750
They're called "Iroha" and "Nio." 
The order makes no sense.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.530
"Nio" should come second.

08:36.660 --> 08:40.690
Ane, San, Rokkaku, Tako, Nishiki!

08:37.760 --> 08:39.090
The order?

08:39.090 --> 08:44.420
Oh, like the poem. "Iroha nihoheto."
"Iroha" comes before "Nio."

08:41.490 --> 08:45.870
Shi, Aya, Buttake, Matsu, Man, Gojo!

08:44.420 --> 08:46.400
No, they're siblings.

08:45.870 --> 08:50.070
Sekida, jingle-jangle, Uo-no-tana!

08:47.680 --> 08:51.740
Iroha's folks passed away 
right after she was born.

08:50.640 --> 08:54.640
Rokujo, Santetsu, cross over every street!

08:52.090 --> 08:55.440
Nio got left at a temple.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.260
Once you pass Hiccho, next come Hakkujo!

08:55.440 --> 08:57.260
I took them both in.

08:58.110 --> 09:02.750
At Toji on Jujo, there you stop!

08:58.130 --> 09:02.690
They're both orphans with 
no blood relatives to speak of.

09:02.690 --> 09:05.770
But we've gotten by together 
for ten years now.

09:05.770 --> 09:08.990
They may not share
the same blood in their veins,

09:09.770 --> 09:13.840
Maru, Take, Ebisu, Ni, Oshi, Oike!

09:10.340 --> 09:13.280
but they're still brother and sister.

09:14.170 --> 09:15.960
I'm sure they are.

09:14.190 --> 09:18.160
Ane, San, Rokkaku, Tako, Nishiki!

09:16.740 --> 09:20.040
They must be a big help around the shop.

09:18.540 --> 09:23.240
Shi, Aya, Buttake, Matsu, Man, Gojo!

09:20.040 --> 09:23.350
Especially Nio. That boy's sharp.

09:23.240 --> 09:27.590
Sekida, jingle-jangle, Uo-no-tana!

09:25.340 --> 09:29.140
He's a handy boy, and clever, too.

09:27.590 --> 09:31.790
Rokujo, Santetsu, cross over every street!

09:29.140 --> 09:32.920
He hardly seems like a child sometimes.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.080
Once you pass Hiccho, next come Hakkujo!

09:33.470 --> 09:38.080
Give him three more years, 
and he'll be able to get by without me.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.680
At Toji on Jujo, there you stop!

09:39.080 --> 09:43.160
And as you can see, 
Iroha's as pretty as she is cheerful.

09:43.160 --> 09:47.180
A noble family's agreed to take her in.

09:47.450 --> 09:50.420
I couldn't be more pleased.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.690
You sound like their real grandmother.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.690
D-Don't talk nonsense!

09:58.690 --> 10:00.130
Honestly!

10:01.530 --> 10:03.630
Why couldn't you have just said "mother"?!

10:08.240 --> 10:13.460
Iroha! Nio! Be home 
before it gets fully dark.

10:13.460 --> 10:14.530
We will!

10:16.080 --> 10:16.880
Sorry.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.000
Oh, it's no big deal.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.780
Go change inside, then let's go home.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.060
Okay!

10:23.710 --> 10:26.080
It's pitch black out.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.740
I'm not worried. I've got you.

10:28.740 --> 10:29.630
Yeah.

10:32.800 --> 10:38.360
You know, Onii, Granny says a
 great noble family's going to adopt me.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.100
That one we deliver dango 
to sometimes, you know?

10:41.100 --> 10:42.500
Yeah, I heard.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.450
I'd really rather stay with 
you and Granny, though.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.320
I'm glad.

10:49.710 --> 10:50.380
Huh?

10:50.790 --> 10:54.000
That family will take 
good care of you, Iroha.

10:56.750 --> 11:01.430
But I know you put up with a lot, too.

11:01.430 --> 11:03.960
It doesn't feel fair.

11:04.390 --> 11:06.260
Don't worry about me.

11:06.260 --> 11:08.270
I'll make Chirinuya a huge success.

11:08.740 --> 11:11.900
I don't really have any dreams 
or ambitions, anyway.

11:12.450 --> 11:14.830
What's life for if not enjoying yourself?

11:16.540 --> 11:19.850
Besides, Granny would cry 
if we left her all alone.

11:19.850 --> 11:22.650
So come visit Chirinuya 
every now and then, okay?

11:23.280 --> 11:24.330
Okay.

11:32.550 --> 11:36.320
You've got a point. 
Granny would get lonely.

11:36.320 --> 11:41.260
I wish I was good at writing.
 I'd send you heaps of letters.

11:41.260 --> 11:43.910
Maybe I ought to practice.

11:43.910 --> 11:45.400
Iroha... This way!

11:45.400 --> 11:46.060
Huh?!

11:51.680 --> 11:54.400
<i>We can't hide here. The moon's too bright.</i>

12:03.440 --> 12:05.360
Wh-What's going on?

12:06.280 --> 12:10.280
Yes, kidnappers.
 They're everywhere these days.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.670
I hear they only go after real young kids.

12:13.310 --> 12:14.880
<i>Kidnappers?</i>

12:16.540 --> 12:17.700
Onii!

12:18.130 --> 12:19.930
Iroha! Get behind me!

12:28.040 --> 12:29.050
Iroha!

12:38.970 --> 12:40.640
So you've finally shown yourselves.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.150
We were getting tired of waiting.

12:48.970 --> 12:51.360
I already hit you, if you're wondering.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.400
Stand back.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.620
Wh-Who are you?

12:57.620 --> 12:59.870
Oh, haven't you heard?

13:00.720 --> 13:02.590
Crying children cry harder...

13:02.590 --> 13:04.010
You mean "fall silent."

13:04.010 --> 13:06.580
...when they see the dreaded Roshigumi.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.880
Don't let them spook you! Get 'em!

13:14.340 --> 13:16.120
Now, who's next?

13:18.570 --> 13:20.110
Oh, hey. It's Toshiro.

13:20.110 --> 13:20.900
Huh?

13:21.450 --> 13:24.240
The way you draw your sword gives you away.

13:25.730 --> 13:29.880
We won't draw. 
You'd only get our blades rusty.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.400
Th-They're so strong.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.590
Where are the kids you snatched?

13:41.870 --> 13:45.520
Damn Miburo. No one likes you outsiders.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.380
So what?

13:52.300 --> 13:54.820
We don't do this to make friends.

13:59.130 --> 14:03.480
Unlike Soji, I've got 
one hell of a short temper.

14:11.220 --> 14:14.820
You drew steel, 
so you must be ready to die by it.

14:17.570 --> 14:19.640
Hijikata-san, stop!

14:30.530 --> 14:31.710
What is it?

14:34.720 --> 14:37.680
They're threatening you 
with a hostage, aren't they?

14:43.160 --> 14:44.440
A hostage like...

14:45.150 --> 14:46.130
a child?

14:48.110 --> 14:49.410
My daughter.

14:52.620 --> 14:55.040
Nio, how could you tell?

14:55.580 --> 14:59.880
He never looked ready to kill
 while holding his sword.

15:02.430 --> 15:03.790
Huh.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.550
Do you know where they hide out?

15:06.970 --> 15:10.010
Next to a pawnshop on Shijo-dori.

15:10.630 --> 15:12.290
How many of them are there?

15:12.800 --> 15:16.060
I don't know. At least ten.

15:16.060 --> 15:18.370
<i>Ten? That's way too many.</i>

15:18.990 --> 15:21.950
All right. Let's head straight there.

15:22.260 --> 15:26.070
P-Please wait! Shouldn't we wait 
for morning and call for help?

15:26.070 --> 15:26.940
Don't worry.

15:30.690 --> 15:32.710
We'll take care of it before dawn.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.900
I promise we'll save her.

15:39.900 --> 15:42.640
Tell your daughter you're proud 
of her when she gets home.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.560
I'm sure she'll be starving.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.770
Feed her some rice balls or something.

15:48.330 --> 15:51.270
Nio. Iroha. Can you get home alone?

15:51.270 --> 15:52.450
Y-Yes.

15:52.710 --> 15:54.340
U-Um...

15:54.560 --> 15:55.870
We'll stop by again tomorrow.

16:02.230 --> 16:05.480
<b>Chirinuya</b>

16:03.590 --> 16:05.490
I couldn't believe my ears!

16:05.820 --> 16:10.490
To think that my Nio and Iroha 
got such a dreadful fright!

16:10.820 --> 16:15.310
They tell me you samurai saved them. 
You're mighty handy with those swords.

16:15.310 --> 16:18.320
And good looking to boot. The ideal men!

16:18.320 --> 16:24.480
Oh, all the kids are fine, 
and the kidnappers ran to the hills.

16:25.430 --> 16:27.990
I doubt they'll be making
 any more mischief.

16:27.990 --> 16:30.130
Thank you so much, Soji!

16:30.760 --> 16:31.770
Isn't that nice?

16:32.240 --> 16:33.780
Your tea, sir.

16:33.780 --> 16:34.360
Thanks.

16:35.140 --> 16:36.260
Hot!

16:39.000 --> 16:41.800
He seems upset for some reason.

16:44.680 --> 16:45.770
Nio.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.270
Would you come to Mibu 
and join the Roshigumi?

16:51.890 --> 16:55.150
You're still a child, 
but you can pull your weight.

16:55.510 --> 16:58.790
We're not asking you 
to fight to the death.

16:58.790 --> 17:01.160
Cooking, cleaning, laundry...

17:01.470 --> 17:03.470
We have lots of jobs that need doing.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.740
My!

17:08.110 --> 17:09.250
Oh, dear.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.250
I see.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.920
Thank you. We'll be back.

17:17.350 --> 17:18.820
May I ask you something?

17:20.520 --> 17:21.400
What is it?

17:23.450 --> 17:26.180
You used Iroha and me as bait, didn't you?

17:28.360 --> 17:29.450
That's right.

17:29.880 --> 17:33.960
We didn't know who they were, 
and time was running out.

17:34.850 --> 17:37.690
Using children as bait saved time.

17:38.720 --> 17:43.710
But Iroha might not be able to go out 
at night for a while because of it.

17:45.690 --> 17:51.120
S-Sorry. It was my idea. 
I didn't think that far ahead.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.350
What's the problem? She can just stay in.

17:56.090 --> 17:57.350
For now.

17:57.930 --> 18:02.280
Oh, what he means is, basically, um...

18:02.280 --> 18:06.130
She'll be able to go out again someday,

18:06.630 --> 18:09.940
because we'll make the world safe for her.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.940
We're like dogs.

18:22.440 --> 18:27.450
People take us in because we seem useful
and kick us out "for our own good."

18:29.720 --> 18:33.040
We might fall ill and die tomorrow!

18:33.460 --> 18:36.210
We'll never even get to meet our parents.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.720
People brawl in broad daylight! 
People attack you on the street at night!

18:41.720 --> 18:42.970
They take land!

18:42.970 --> 18:43.970
They take money!

18:44.330 --> 18:45.470
They take lives!

18:45.470 --> 18:48.100
They fight! Rape! Kill!

18:49.950 --> 18:54.090
We've put up with it all this time.

18:54.470 --> 18:56.170
We grinned and bore it!

18:57.430 --> 18:59.450
Isn't that always the way?

18:59.840 --> 19:02.450
Everyone knows who always gets sacrificed!

19:03.270 --> 19:05.640
Who always gets hurt!

19:07.220 --> 19:09.950
It's always the weakest! Always the kids!

19:22.680 --> 19:23.620
But...

19:25.110 --> 19:30.000
More than anything, 
I hate how powerless I am.

19:34.710 --> 19:39.630
I want to get strong, too.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.910
I want...

19:46.770 --> 19:49.050
to change this world.

20:08.910 --> 20:10.220
You have a deal.

20:25.010 --> 20:26.480
Thank you for waiting.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.740
Here. Granny told me 
to at least bring a gift.

20:30.740 --> 20:32.300
Now, let's get going.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.050
Don't forget to bow!

20:35.470 --> 20:38.820
And what do you say?
"Thank you, sirs! I'm your debt!"

20:38.820 --> 20:40.310
Y-Yes.

20:40.310 --> 20:45.300
And for the last time, Nio, I'm the 
closest thing to a parent you've got.

20:45.300 --> 20:46.550
Granny.

20:49.420 --> 20:53.320
Thank you, sirs. I'm in your debt.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.500
Fine.

20:59.460 --> 21:03.990
You'll be the third wolf 
to join us in Kyoto.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.330
<i>And that's how...</i>

21:13.110 --> 21:15.010
<i>I joined the Miburo.</i>

21:17.700 --> 21:21.220
<i>All the people I'd meet there...</i>

21:28.040 --> 21:31.180
<i>and every single moment I'd experience...</i>

21:34.420 --> 21:37.860
<i>would leave a huge mark on this world...</i>

21:39.460 --> 21:41.610
<i>and on my life.</i>

21:44.990 --> 21:49.990
<b>The 
Wolves 
of Mibu</b>

21:44.990 --> 21:49.990
<b>and 
a Boy</b>

23:20.080 --> 23:25.590
<b>Next time</b>

23:21.360 --> 23:26.840
<i>The boy became a Miburo 
as the cherry trees blossomed.</i>

23:26.840 --> 23:33.340
<i>He and his comrades would witness 
a heartless world that reeked of blood.</i>

23:33.690 --> 23:37.380
<i>Even as he felt the urge to run,</i>

23:37.380 --> 23:42.630
<i>the young wolf kept searching 
for his own truth, his own justice.</i>

23:43.590 --> 23:46.550
<i>Next time: "A World Where It's Okay to Cry."</i>

23:47.150 --> 23:49.980
<b>A World
Where</b>

23:47.150 --> 23:49.980
<b>It's Okay
 to Cry</b>

23:47.160 --> 23:48.390
<i>It won't disappoint.</i>
