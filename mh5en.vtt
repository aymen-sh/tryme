<b>the source of unprecedented disaster,

<b>Therefore, in order to

<b>all parts of U.A. will be under

<b>Please be ready for the evacuation

<b>Honest to a fault.</b>

11:31.400 --> 11:33.670
<b>After leaving U.A.,</b>

<b>we moved to a new headquarters

11:41.840 --> 11:48.350
<b>Makeshift Fortress "Troy"</b>

<b>Because we have Cementos,

<b>Everyone, take your bags to your

<b>How kind.</b>

11:57.900 --> 12:00.550
<b>I hope it doesn't turn into

<b>Oh, Deku!</b>

12:20.330 --> 12:21.780
<b>Are you done unpacking?</b>

12:21.780 --> 12:24.790
<b>Yeah. I didn't bring much with me.</b>

12:24.790 --> 12:26.490
<b>Same. I just have a change of clothes.</b>

12:30.880 --> 12:33.700
<b>Uraraka, thanks for what

12:34.180 --> 12:37.620
<b>I didn't get a chance to thank

<b>What are you doing outside?</b>

12:45.390 --> 12:49.110
<b>Oh... I was looking at the city.</b>

12:50.690 --> 12:54.330
<b>I'm weird, aren't I?</b>

12:54.330 --> 12:55.650
<b>No, you're not!</b>

12:55.650 --> 12:57.890
<b>You're strong, and brave, and your

<b>and you're kind and cool and--</b>

12:59.640 --> 13:01.330
<b>That's not what I meant.</b>

13:02.430 --> 13:06.840
<b>Back then, when I was talking 
on top of the school building,</b>

13:07.230 --> 13:11.050
<b>I started thinking about Himiko 
Toga all of a sudden.</b>

13:12.260 --> 13:15.970
<b>When we were fighting one-on-one 
during Gigantomachia's progression,</b>

13:16.520 --> 13:21.810
<b>I said things that I thought 
were just common sense.</b>

13:22.370 --> 13:25.060
<b>She looked really sad hearing them.</b>

13:27.700 --> 13:29.780
<b>She's a villain who did this to the city--</b>

13:29.780 --> 13:32.740
<b>who stole so many people's 
lives and happiness.</b>

13:33.240 --> 13:35.930
<b>It's not a matter of forgiving 
her or not anymore.</b>

13:35.930 --> 13:36.870
<b>I know this.</b>

13:37.770 --> 13:38.990
<b>But...</b>

13:39.750 --> 13:43.610
<b>I don't know what is common sense for her.</b>

13:43.610 --> 13:48.250
<b>I was just thinking that I don't 
know anything about Himiko Toga.</b>

13:49.220 --> 13:51.420
<b>That's why I was looking at the city.</b>

13:52.120 --> 13:55.090
<b>So I won't forget the abominable 
scene from that day...</b>

13:55.640 --> 13:58.200
<b>So I won't think about 
anything unnecessary...</b>

13:59.900 --> 14:01.720
<b>It's the same for me.</b>

14:01.720 --> 14:02.510
<b>Huh?</b>

14:03.020 --> 14:08.140
<b>Inside Shigaraki, I saw 
a little boy crying.</b>

14:09.290 --> 14:11.600
<b>Even if I can't avoid fighting,</b>

14:11.600 --> 14:14.650
<b>I don't want to ignore 
what's deep inside him.</b>

14:19.060 --> 14:22.320
<b>Then, we're both weird.</b>

14:24.090 --> 14:26.310
<b>Sorry to make you worry about me.</b>

14:26.790 --> 14:27.720
<b>I'm fine now.</b>

14:28.090 --> 14:30.050
<b>I have an older brother, too.</b>

14:30.520 --> 14:33.310
<b>There's no comparing our families.</b>

14:33.990 --> 14:37.600
<b>I don't even know what Toya likes.</b>

14:37.930 --> 14:41.330
<b>It's definitely udon. The really hot kind.</b>

14:43.030 --> 14:47.080
<b>In that case, I'll eat some with him.</b>

14:51.470 --> 14:53.130
<b>We'll definitely stop them.</b>

14:56.620 --> 14:59.000
<b>Ochaco Uraraka</b>

<b>3 days later</b>

15:04.320 --> 15:07.120
<b>Lies won't work on me.</b>

15:07.500 --> 15:11.850
<b>I'll be able to tell if someone has the 
slightest bit of ill will toward me.</b>

15:12.260 --> 15:15.210
<b>What was the name of that Quirk again?</b>

15:15.210 --> 15:17.750
<b>It was during the early 
days of superpowers,</b>

15:18.190 --> 15:21.840
<b>and it was combined with something 
else, so I'm not sure...</b>

15:22.830 --> 15:26.950
<b>I think its owner was a boring guy.</b>

15:27.350 --> 15:30.200
<b>His descendants were better, though.</b>

15:30.620 --> 15:32.290
<b>A twist of fate</b>

15:32.290 --> 15:36.340
<b>brought one of them to work with All 
Might to drive me into a corner.</b>

15:36.910 --> 15:41.960
<b>But this time, that Quirk will help me win.</b>

15:42.590 --> 15:47.260
<b>There is no greater joy than when 
the seeds you sow bear fruit.</b>

15:48.210 --> 15:50.230
<b>We're all doing well, as usual.</b>

15:50.230 --> 15:52.470
<b>I want to drink some liquor.</b>

15:52.740 --> 15:55.690
<b>Some 40-year Macallan would be nice.</b>

15:55.690 --> 15:59.250
<b>I can have my son bring you a bottle 
that was aged for 16 years.</b>

15:59.250 --> 16:01.470
<b>That'll do.</b>

16:01.860 --> 16:06.060
<b>Can you give me your son's 
contact information?</b>

16:06.060 --> 16:08.150
<b>Just in case.</b>

16:08.480 --> 16:10.380
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

16:10.380 --> 16:13.160
<b>You never know what will 
happen these days, Uncle.</b>

16:13.430 --> 16:15.370
<b>Yes, that's true.</b>

16:15.850 --> 16:17.750
<b>No lies or ill will.</b>

16:17.750 --> 16:19.030
<b>Completely clear.</b>

16:19.480 --> 16:24.850
<b>Even if she's questioned later, 
it won't be a problem.</b>

16:25.610 --> 16:29.730
<b>This will be the last time we use this 
idiotic method of encoded talk.</b>

16:30.540 --> 16:32.260
<b>Until tomorrow, then.</b>

16:32.530 --> 16:34.990
<b>Yes, until tomorrow.</b>

16:40.590 --> 16:42.200
<b>Shall we go?</b>

16:52.950 --> 16:54.510
<b>Thanks for coming.</b>

16:55.050 --> 16:57.620
<b>Aoyama, why are you here?</b>

16:58.060 --> 16:59.750
<b>I thought you were in a police cell...</b>

17:00.160 --> 17:02.660
<b>My parents' lawyer got me released.</b>

17:03.070 --> 17:05.600
<b>I'll tell the others! We can 
start searching again--</b>

17:05.600 --> 17:06.300
<b>Wait.</b>

17:07.280 --> 17:09.290
<b>I want to talk to you.</b>

17:13.100 --> 17:14.520
<b>It's funny, isn't it?</b>

17:14.800 --> 17:18.790
<b>That in this crumbling Japan, 
the courts are still working.</b>

17:20.250 --> 17:24.790
<b>What can we become in this world, living 
the way we've lived until now?</b>

17:25.450 --> 17:26.860
<b>Aoyama...</b>

17:26.860 --> 17:30.060
<b>I'll tell you All For One's true goal.</b>

17:31.050 --> 17:35.610
<b>Do you know what the rest of the world 
is like now, with Japan like this?</b>

17:36.200 --> 17:42.700
<b>Nikkei Average
Compared to previous day
Yen Exchange Rate</b>

17:36.720 --> 17:39.650
<b>The value of the yen has 
suddenly taken a nosedive,</b>

17:39.650 --> 17:42.350
<b>and many Japanese companies are 
starting to declare bankruptcy.</b>

17:43.160 --> 17:45.750
<b>In addition, all the villains 
are becoming active at once,</b>

17:45.750 --> 17:47.980
<b>and damage is spreading 
across whole nations.</b>

17:48.480 --> 17:50.040
<b>The world is in a panic similar to</b>

17:50.040 --> 17:53.010
<b>the Great Depression, or when 
Quirks first appeared.</b>

17:54.200 --> 18:00.390
<b>Worldwide unemployment, currency 
collapse, widespread panic.</b>

18:00.390 --> 18:03.350
<b>What are you talking about, Aoyama?</b>

18:03.760 --> 18:06.960
<b>If we lose the strength to 
enforce long-term policies,</b>

18:06.960 --> 18:08.980
<b>we can only focus on the safety 
of what's in front of us,</b>

18:08.980 --> 18:10.800
<b>resulting in war and poverty.</b>

18:11.700 --> 18:13.370
<b>The other countries have abandoned Japan</b>

18:13.820 --> 18:16.880
<b>because they need to prioritize 
their own safety.</b>

18:17.790 --> 18:21.840
<b>In a world like that, if someone appears 
in a country impacted by drought</b>

18:21.840 --> 18:24.340
<b>with a Quirk that can 
produce potable water...</b>

18:24.880 --> 18:27.600
<b>Or electricity, or gas, or strength...</b>

18:28.610 --> 18:31.900
<b>As the world moves into a 
state of decline and chaos,</b>

18:31.900 --> 18:37.670
<b>it forms the foundation for a single 
overwhelming person to take the initiative.</b>

18:38.390 --> 18:41.290
<b>He can become the world's demon lord.</b>

18:41.590 --> 18:44.430
<b>Only one thing is needed to 
upset that equilibrium.</b>

18:45.140 --> 18:47.300
<b>I don't think it matters what.</b>

18:47.680 --> 18:52.320
<b>That's not right. The 
world wouldn't allow it.</b>

18:52.890 --> 18:57.160
<b>Besides, we're still here!</b>

18:58.020 --> 19:02.740
<b>Yeah. That's why this has to be the end.</b>

19:03.500 --> 19:04.540
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

19:04.950 --> 19:09.290
<b>I want to protect Papa and Maman!</b>

19:09.840 --> 19:11.720
<b>All For One!</b>

19:11.720 --> 19:15.450
<b>Good job, Yuga Aoyama.</b>

19:15.810 --> 19:19.120
<b>It was scary to betray 
your friends, wasn't it?</b>

19:19.120 --> 19:22.960
<b>Isn't it distressing to be trusted?</b>

19:23.530 --> 19:25.610
<b>Good job overcoming that.</b>

19:26.240 --> 19:29.890
<b>All that talk about my 
ultimate goal was great.</b>

19:29.890 --> 19:32.390
<b>It's not entirely accurate, though.</b>

19:32.390 --> 19:35.140
<b>Did you hear about it from 
your mommy and daddy?</b>

19:35.390 --> 19:36.130
<b>Yes...</b>

19:36.540 --> 19:40.610
<b>They said you promised we 
would be happy in your world.</b>

19:40.610 --> 19:42.190
<b>I trusted you!</b>

19:43.210 --> 19:46.440
<b>My feelings can't be described...</b>

19:47.170 --> 19:48.870
<b>by just the word "distressed," Uncle!</b>

19:51.530 --> 19:53.910
<b>You ungrateful--</b>

19:54.270 --> 19:56.590
<b>Your acting was too realistic, Aoyama!</b>

19:56.590 --> 20:00.220
<b>What else could I do? We 
had to get him out here!</b>

20:00.220 --> 20:02.820
<b>Besides, your acting was amazing, too!</b>

20:02.820 --> 20:06.670
<b>Even if we were just trying to lure 
him out, when I saw those tears--</b>

20:06.670 --> 20:09.130
<b>I was so scared, it wasn't 
just tears that came out--</b>

20:09.130 --> 20:10.800
<b>I wet myself, too!</b>

20:10.800 --> 20:13.020
<b>You did good, Aoyama!</b>

20:13.430 --> 20:15.570
<b>For Papa and Maman's sakes,</b>

20:15.570 --> 20:18.730
<b>for everyone else, and for myself, too--</b>

20:19.820 --> 20:22.580
<b>I will fight All For One!</b>

20:23.650 --> 20:25.390
<b>How disappointing.</b>

20:26.380 --> 20:28.420
<b>What is the meaning of this?</b>

20:29.160 --> 20:32.420
<b>I can bring him out. Just tell me when.</b>

20:32.420 --> 20:34.780
<b>In our contact right before,</b>

20:34.780 --> 20:36.820
<b>and in the conversation with his parents,</b>

20:36.820 --> 20:39.310
<b>there were no lies or ill will.</b>

20:39.310 --> 20:40.910
<b>How did they...?</b>

20:41.950 --> 20:44.080
<b>No, it doesn't matter.</b>

20:44.890 --> 20:49.470
<b>Even if it was a trap, One For 
All is in front of me now.</b>

20:50.150 --> 20:54.220
<b>Search can tell me the location and 
weaknesses of what it has seen.</b>

20:54.840 --> 21:00.630
<b>The heroes Tomura saw in the previous battle 
are spread out around the country.</b>

21:00.630 --> 21:03.700
<b>They won't be able to come help right away.</b>

21:04.130 --> 21:10.000
<b>That's why we were able to bring so 
many here without being noticed.</b>

21:10.410 --> 21:14.070
<b>They're already too late!</b>

21:15.000 --> 21:16.660
<b>All For One...!</b>

21:17.510 --> 21:19.340
<b>Kurogiri...</b>

21:19.340 --> 21:21.240
<b>How did they use him?</b>

21:21.680 --> 21:26.130
<b>But this could save me some trouble... Hm?</b>

21:26.520 --> 21:28.810
<b>Papa and Maman told me this, too--</b>

21:30.110 --> 21:33.050
<b>"That's why the thing All For One hates most</b>

21:33.570 --> 21:36.720
<b>is for the world to know 
that Japan isn't done yet.</b>

21:37.520 --> 21:39.520
<b>That we show them that there's 
light after the recovery,</b>

21:40.190 --> 21:43.210
<b>causing the world to unite as one."</b>

21:43.810 --> 21:48.440
<b>That's why today, we will defeat you here!</b>

23:19.960 --> 23:21.960
<b>Preview</b>

23:20.740 --> 23:21.950
<b>Here's the preview!</b>

23:22.550 --> 23:26.000
<b>The last decisive battle between heroes 
and villains has finally begun!</b>

23:27.400 --> 23:30.630
<b>For the heroes' plan to 
separate the villains,</b>

23:30.630 --> 23:33.320
<b>the key players are Aoyama,</b>

23:33.320 --> 23:36.100
<b>Shinso, with his Quirk, Brainwashing,</b>

23:36.100 --> 23:38.390
<b>and Monoma, with his Quirk, Copy.</b>

23:39.230 --> 23:42.660
<b>We will make sure this plan succeeds!</b>

23:43.570 --> 23:45.400
<b>Next time, "Division"!</b>

23:45.940 --> 23:49.940
<b>Next time: Division</b>

23:45.950 --> 23:47.430
<b>Go beyond!</b>

23:47.430 --> 23:48.900
<b>Plus Ultra!</b>
