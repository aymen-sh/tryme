WEBVTT

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.601
Damn it.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.228
Oh, Deacon Kang!

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.605
Come on, that was a pretty nice shot.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:29.154
I want to play a round of golf with you,
but I don't seem to be getting any better.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:31.656
Come on, you can just come.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.074
Are you signing Ju-eun up

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:35.577
for a language study abroad program
during the break?

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:36.911
I'm not sure.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.164
She's still quite young.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.791
What are you talking about?

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.086
Kids pick up languages better
when they are younger.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.171
You're right.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.590
Actually, I'm quite worried.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:51.176
What if they're already falling behind?

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:55.472
I'm worried our kids might end up like us
if we do nothing and--

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.016
Enough. You're embarrassing us
in front of the deacons.

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:59.225
But it's true.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:03.146
Your career has no future,
and a cop's salary is clear-cut.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.523
I don't see you getting promoted
any time soon.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:09.110
Well, if we all pray hard together,

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.279
perhaps a miracle will occur.

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.031
Amen to that.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.951
-Yes.
-Well, now that we're on the subject.

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:17.952
It's our pastor,

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.580
he didn't come to service last week.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.540
Have you heard anything?

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.459
Well, I'm not sure.

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.461
I heard from the hair salon

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:30.423
that the pastor's wife looked
quite anxious for some reason.

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.761
I haven't been able to get in touch
with her recently, so I'm a bit worried.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:39.224
I'll stop by to check in on them
when I'm out on patrol later.

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:40.141
Don't worry.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.476
-Thank you.
-Sure.

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:44.479
Where do kids go for language learning?

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.272
Lately, Canada is…

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:15.927
Korean tidal flats.

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:18.888
Recently, interest in tidal flats
is increasing

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.890
as they are known to absorb carbon.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.519
The academic world calls tidal flats
a blue carbon ecosystem

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:26.646
because they reduce greenhouse gases.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:27.564
Today we will…

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:28.481
Pastor Kwon.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.529
You were home, Pastor.

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:38.408
We have with us Professor Yoon Ji-hong
from Hankuk University.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.368
Hello. I'm Yoon Ji-hong.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.036
Professor Yoon.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.371
As mentioned earlier,

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:46.374
certain conditions must exist
for the tidal flats in Korea,

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:50.253
designated as UNESCO sites, to be formed.
What's your opinion?

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.462
Pastor Kwon?

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:54.883
First, in order for tidal flats to form,

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.135
it is often said

00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:01.931
that at least three
oceanographic conditions must be met.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.516
Excuse me for a moment.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.121
Pastor Kwon.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.217
Oh, my God! What is this? What…

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.056
Are you the police?

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.224
What is this?

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:53.650
Our species was born
with one command to follow.

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:55.652
"Eat

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.403
humans."

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:02.784
So, I did some research on humans
and the human world.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.372
But unlike other species,

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.250
humans survive using

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.752
a very interesting method.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.880
You do not need to be afraid.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:21.427
I will make a proposal to you.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.054
I do not believe

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.391
it will be a bad deal for you either.

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:29.310
If you do not accept,

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:31.646
you will

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:33.898
die here too.

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:40.029
I…

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.450
do not wish to take over just one human

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.245
but to become the head
of a human organization.

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:50.790
As the head of a human organization,

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.500
I want to parasitize

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.837
that organization.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.103
What is it with your awkward smile?

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.023
Is this not the time
to have a serious look?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.234
As expected, you adapt quickly.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.236
By the way,

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.906
if our plan succeeds…

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:28.786
shouldn't I at least become an assemblyman

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.330
to properly assist you?

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.417
You can become anything you want.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.755
We will soon control
the human organization.

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.652
SPECIAL PRESS CONFERENCE
ON THE PARASITES IN NAMIL-GUN

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:06.949
Hello.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:10.411
I am Kim Chul-min,
Captain of Violent Crimes Team 3.

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.331
Today, I would like to update you

00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:15.792
on our parasite investigation.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.253
Recently, we executed

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:23.466
a large-scale clean-up operation
with the parasite task force.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:26.052
As a result, we were able to eradicate

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:29.764
almost all the parasites in our region.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.266
However, we have determined

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.228
that some survived
and are still hiding in the area.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:41.234
While the Korean Folk Music Festival
will proceed as scheduled,

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:44.904
as mentioned earlier,
we urge the public to remain vigilant

00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:49.450
until the parasites
are eradicated completely.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.747
Next, it was decided today

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:58.251
by the Personal Information
Disclosure Committee to make

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.420
this personal information public.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.881
Jeong Su-in, 29 years old.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:07.218
Seol Kyung-hee, 45 years old.

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:11.347
They are both residents of Namil-gun,

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.142
female, and around 160 centimeters tall.

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.436
The two women pictured here…

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.603
That'll be 6,800 won.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.355
…are extremely dangerous parasites.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:24.360
If you encounter them
or see anyone with strange behavior,

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:28.156
please send in a tip or report it
immediately to the Namil Police Station

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:31.075
or the parasite task force at the NPA.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:34.912
This information will be available
on the NPA website

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.373
so that all citizens have access to it.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:42.920
Once again,
we ask the public and the media

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:46.591
for your cooperation and to provide
any information you may have.

00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:49.552
Everyone knows what you look like now.
Let's be careful.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.389
But why are they taking
such drastic measures?

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.601
The mayor is coming
to the Korean Folk Music Festival.

00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:01.022
If Heidi and that monster show up as well,
things will get really messy.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:04.233
So it will try to switch over
to the mayor's body then.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.113
KYUNG-HEE

00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:15.536
Hello?

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:17.455
It is your sister.

00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:21.584
You crazy shit.
Don't you say those words to me!

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:22.960
Let us meet.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.796
You think I've lost my mind?
Why would I meet you?

00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:29.467
Tell this to my kin that you are with,

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:31.677
who I believe will understand.

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.012
Fuck off.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:36.641
It's me.

00:08:36.724 --> 00:08:39.810
You must know you and I are
in the same boat if you saw the news.

00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:42.021
Let us meet at once.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.274
I will be waiting
at Cheongil Botanical Garden.

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:50.196
Are you really going to meet her?

00:08:51.572 --> 00:08:53.741
The monster that killed Mr. Chul-min

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:57.203
is now trying to become
the mayor of a big city.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:02.416
So what?
What can the two of us actually do?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.169
That's exactly why we need
more people on our side.

00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:55.595
PARASYTE: THE GREY

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:03.811
Good work.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.354
Thank you.

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:13.904
Well, that was a good briefing.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:15.865
Oh, thank you.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:19.160
I think it went well, just as we agreed.

00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:20.286
Is there a problem?

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:22.747
No, I wouldn't say it's a problem.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.876
I mean, you put in so much effort
to protect Jeong Su-in this whole time.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:31.547
But today, it seems like
you've had a change of heart.

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:34.383
Is that what you think?

00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:38.846
The safety of the public should come
before any personal feelings, right?

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:40.556
Really?

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.517
When we raided Saejin Church,
not long ago,

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:46.312
you found something
that belonged to her, didn't you?

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.065
The thing you hid in your pocket.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.902
Then you met her at that theme park
to confirm if it was hers.

00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:55.321
What was the item?

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.161
Does that really matter right now?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.419
Whether you're trying to deny it

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.506
or not remembering it at all,

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.466
I can't really tell.

00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:21.430
He's very soft-hearted, you know?

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.391
We have to get going now, okay?

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:25.476
Let's go.

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:31.440
That one is suspicious of me.

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:33.526
Let's get rid of it now.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.362
-We need to make it look natural.
-How?

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:39.824
With the method humans use.

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:42.076
By utilizing an organization.

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:55.005
Is this the right place?
You agreed to meet here?

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:57.425
I can sense it.

00:11:58.175 --> 00:11:59.385
It's further inside.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.055
Why here, of all places?

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.978
You know it'll be a disaster
if Heidi and that thing fight.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:10.688
She will know that too.

00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:12.523
Damn, you startled me.

00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:14.150
You stay here.

00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:15.776
Why?

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.697
Your thirst for revenge
makes you a liability right now.

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:46.682
Why did you ask to meet?

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.519
To punish the one who betrayed our kin.

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:54.315
The one that jumped from Pastor Kwon
to Detective Kim Chul-min.

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:56.317
I must kill him.

00:12:57.818 --> 00:13:00.780
Did you not understand
when he went on the news to provoke us?

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:02.907
It is an obvious trap.

00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:05.659
He is trying to drag us into a scheme.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.454
It does not matter.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:13.542
I am going to kill him.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.171
But he is already parasitizing
a human organization.

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.633
Organizations are truly amazing.

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:25.596
A single creature may be weak,

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:30.476
but an organization formed by many of them
is highly resilient and powerful.

00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:34.355
He understood this.

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:36.690
Are you asking me for help?

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.445
The owner of this body may agree,
but I do not.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.826
You want to kill him too, do you not?

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.955
It is an irrational choice
that goes against survival.

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:56.293
Survival?

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.964
Is survival all that matters to you?

00:14:14.895 --> 00:14:15.896
Look at this man.

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.525
He came at me
even though he knew that he could die.

00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:21.610
It was definitely not a rational choice.

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:25.406
But I can now understand
what this man is feeling.

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:28.826
I came to understand it
when our kin was killed by him.

00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:31.871
Damn it, how dare you say
that you understand me!

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:34.999
We can neither live independently

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.918
nor preserve our species
through reproduction.

00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:42.673
The only thing we can do
is parasitize humans and eat them.

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:46.468
It's your fault for being born a parasite.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.768
What's wrong with him?

00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:56.312
That is right.

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:59.523
We were not given a choice,

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.442
so we had to ask this question.

00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:06.322
"What is the reason for our existence?"

00:15:09.116 --> 00:15:10.826
Then one of our kin answered.

00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:14.705
That we must protect each other.

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:18.876
That we must be able
to rely on each other.

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.881
And that we must create
an organization and survive together.

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:27.843
The one who gave us
the meaning of our existence…

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:32.181
is the one I want to kill.

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:34.141
Don't be an idiot.

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:37.102
The bastards who say that kind of stuff

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:40.105
are the first to backstab others
for their own survival.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.193
Do you know what he is after?

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.569
Do you want to know?

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.404
The festival is happening tomorrow.

00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:49.782
The mayor of Namcheon
will be attending. Okay?

00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:52.242
I'm sure that bastard is after
the mayor's head.

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:55.287
If he takes over the mayor's brain,

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:59.166
it will be more difficult
for the two of you to survive.

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:02.586
In the end, you will be killed by humans.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.630
What will the both of you do?

00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:07.549
We're going to kill that bastard

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.635
before he has a chance to kill the mayor.

00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:11.095
And the next to die

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.222
will be you, got it?

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:16.684
I'm gonna tear that fucking head of yours
from my sister's body.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.312
The latter part of your plan
will not go as you wish,

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:24.400
but until then, we have the same goal.

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:41.875
{\an8}OPENING CEREMONY OF CHOI YONG-JAE
MEMORIAL HALL, A CIVILIAN ARMY LEADER

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:12.406
Did the results I requested come out yet?

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.244
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.583
This is the autopsy image
of Hunting Dog Number One.

00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:24.334
And this is an image

00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:27.129
of a weapon that
the parasites transform their bodies into

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:29.256
that was seen in various cases.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.885
Did you check to see
if it can be reproduced in a similar way?

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:36.472
We made a similar cross-section
with a kitchen knife

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:38.599
and tried to recreate a cut on the neck.

00:17:38.682 --> 00:17:40.809
It did make a similar pattern.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:44.396
So, you're saying it's possible
to use a purposely crafted weapon

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.691
to manipulate it
as if a parasite did the killing, right?

00:17:48.942 --> 00:17:51.945
Yes, unfortunately,
it's a point we overlooked.

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:54.782
But it's definitely possible
that it was manipulated.

00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:57.493
Should we reinvestigate the case?

00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:00.370
No.

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:04.500
Nothing is certain yet.
Let's keep this to ourselves for now.

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:05.417
Yes, ma'am.

00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:10.839
Yes, I'm at the station.

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:13.175
What?

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:18.889
Oh, Captain Choi.

00:18:19.389 --> 00:18:21.225
We've received a tip-off.

00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:25.229
The same symbol found in Saejin Church
was discovered in a church in Gangwon-do.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.397
A tip-off?

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.108
When and how did we get the report?

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:32.111
Captain Kim received
an anonymous tip-off this morning

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:33.237
and reported it to HQ.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.446
Captain Kim?

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:39.409
Now that the parasites in Namil-gun
are almost eradicated,

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:42.496
I believe your team should be deployed
to Gangwon-do.

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:44.665
What are your thoughts on this?

00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:48.418
Shouldn't we check
if the report is reliable first, sir?

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:51.213
It should be Team Grey
who goes and confirms that.

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.756
Right away if possible.

00:18:54.007 --> 00:18:55.717
What about the ones remaining here?

00:18:55.801 --> 00:19:00.097
{\an8}The local police force
should be able to handle that much.

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:04.810
{\an8}Team Grey should immediately move
to Gangwon-do and begin subjugation there.

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:20.909
The advance party, get ready!

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.120
-Go over to that side now.
-Yes, sir.

00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:25.122
What are they so busy doing?

00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:28.667
They're providing security escort
at the festival. It's for the mayor.

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:15.631
Yes, this is Jeong Su-in's cell phone.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.174
It's me.

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:21.220
Jeong Su-in? Or that monster?

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.722
Sure, it is the monster you want to kill.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.893
At this rate, I might grow fond of you.

00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:29.561
What do you want?

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:32.105
We made a mistake.

00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:36.151
As you said,
Detective Kang is not a parasite.

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:38.654
He is a human

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:41.615
but joined hands with the pastor,
who is their leader.

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.577
He killed the Hunting Dog
you cherished so dearly

00:20:47.162 --> 00:20:50.249
and helped the pastor transfer himself
to Captain Kim's body.

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:55.337
You said they were both parasites.

00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:57.839
But now he's just a traitor?

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:02.094
This came directly from a parasite
who was on the same side as the pastor.

00:21:02.844 --> 00:21:04.763
But there is an even bigger problem.

00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:06.807
Their ultimate goal

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:11.103
is to kill the mayor at the festival
and switch over to his body.

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:14.940
-What?
-Believe what I am saying.

00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:16.733
We are going there right now

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:18.443
to kill him.

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:22.531
If we fail, someone else
has to do it and succeed.

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:26.576
So you should also come
and help in killing him.

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:38.505
What did she say? How did she react?

00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:39.923
Nothing yet.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:44.886
I will now save my energy for the festival
which will take place soon.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.180
Sure, of course. Go to sleep.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:59.443
But the pastor Kang Won-seok brought along
cut off his head.

00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:04.197
And that bastard took over his body
and is pretending to be him!

00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:05.532
Why won't you believe me?

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:09.286
Turn the car around.

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:11.997
What? But what about Gangwon-do?

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:15.292
I'll take full responsibility.
Turn around now.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:16.877
Yes, ma'am.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.621
Sir, look over here.

00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:54.206
Over here, sir.

00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:09.888
Nothing to note so far.

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:13.058
Maybe it's waiting for us
to create a scene.

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:15.268
How is it over there?

00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:18.980
It's the same here.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.150
-Should we get going too?
-No.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.319
For now, let's just wait as Heidi said.

00:23:25.153 --> 00:23:27.906
If you two come close,
that bastard will notice right away.

00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:30.700
Maintain your distance.

00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:33.954
Come if something happens.
I'll be monitoring from here.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.249
-Sir, you should try some hotteok.
-Oh, sure.

00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:39.251
This is the most famous shop in Namil-gun.

00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:40.168
-Is that so?
-Yes.

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.670
-Oh, welcome.
-Hello.

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.047
It looks so delicious.

00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:47.717
Okay, a big one to-go,
specially for Mr. Mayor.

00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:50.262
Here you go.
It's hot, so please be careful.

00:23:51.888 --> 00:23:53.765
-Oh God!
-Oh no.

00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:58.645
It's quite chewy and delicious.

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:02.190
Is this made with local flour?

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:04.943
-No, it's imported flour.
-What?

00:24:06.653 --> 00:24:08.864
But Namil-gun is famous

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:11.158
for making all kinds of food
so deliciously.

00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:15.036
-Amazing cooking skills are the specialty!
-Correct.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.163
Yes, cooking skills.

00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:22.335
Hey, don't just stand here.

00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:24.921
Go check where he's going next
and wait there. Hurry up.

00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:25.964
-Yes, sir.
-Sir.

00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:31.803
Is this necessary?

00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:35.098
Even if human cops are there,

00:24:35.182 --> 00:24:39.311
if Heidi and I attack him together,
we should be able to get rid of him.

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:45.358
Heidi is not cautious
because she is afraid…

00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:48.904
but because of me.

00:24:49.404 --> 00:24:50.864
She doesn't want me in danger.

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:54.826
She was so unlucky.

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:59.456
Out of all the people out there,
she came inside of me while I was dying.

00:25:01.416 --> 00:25:03.335
That's why
she couldn't fully take over me.

00:25:05.086 --> 00:25:08.006
She had to save me first
in order for her to live.

00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:12.219
So, in the end,
she became an incomplete being

00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:16.431
who can only use her strength
for 10 to 15 minutes at a time.

00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:22.771
She can't transfer herself
into another body like you or the others.

00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:25.815
So,

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.568
that is why she is powerful.

00:25:29.653 --> 00:25:30.487
What?

00:25:30.987 --> 00:25:35.534
Generally, when our kin first takes over
a human body and is able to control it,

00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:37.953
we no longer consider that body
a part of ourselves.

00:25:38.912 --> 00:25:41.957
It is similar to humans driving a car.

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:45.418
If it breaks, though inconvenient,
you can throw it away.

00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:48.880
But Heidi could not do that.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.008
She had to protect a part of herself.

00:25:53.134 --> 00:25:55.136
That is why Heidi had to be strong

00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:57.556
and always fought so desperately

00:25:58.557 --> 00:25:59.975
in order to protect you.

00:26:08.858 --> 00:26:09.859
It's on the move.

00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:11.361
What? Where?

00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:34.843
Mr. Mayor! This way!

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:52.777
Enter the festival grounds now.

00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:53.695
Move!

00:27:11.421 --> 00:27:12.881
Go to the mayor.

00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:13.965
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes.

00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:41.368
Have they lost their fucking minds?

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.082
Come on, evacuate now!

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:48.208
Quick! Get up.

00:27:51.127 --> 00:27:53.880
Hey, they're taking the mayor
into a building, okay?

00:27:53.963 --> 00:27:55.632
Get over here quickly. Oh fuck.

00:28:01.971 --> 00:28:04.432
Jeong Su-in, it's time to surrender!

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.934
Come out!

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:09.354
I will take care of that woman.
You go ahead.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.566
Good. Do as we say now.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:16.611
Damn it.

00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:46.307
Do you really need to kill me?

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.187
Our goal is simply to live.

00:28:52.647 --> 00:28:56.401
I do not want to hurt anyone,
including you.

00:28:57.694 --> 00:28:58.903
The choice is yours.

00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:10.206
Over here.

00:29:24.304 --> 00:29:25.138
What the hell?

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:27.265
The head is missing.

00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:34.189
Where?

00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:36.566
The back parking lot? Got it.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.110
There's a car waiting for you, sir.

00:29:41.237 --> 00:29:42.864
The back parking lot.

00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:04.928
What the hell?

00:30:06.554 --> 00:30:07.388
Hey!

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.686
We're on your side.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:57.480
It cannot survive for long without a host.
You take the mayor--

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.827
Hey, are you okay?

00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:37.604
To you,

00:31:39.272 --> 00:31:40.106
I am sorry.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:36.871
How long can you hold on?

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:43.336
There's no one here

00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:45.797
you can transfer yourself to.

00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:47.882
What do we do?

00:33:29.632 --> 00:33:31.092
Where do we have to go?

00:33:31.801 --> 00:33:34.053
-Where?
-The back parking lot.

00:33:34.137 --> 00:33:35.555
-We need to go there.
-The back?

00:34:25.271 --> 00:34:26.147
Hurry up and go!

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:32.737
To the right!

00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:53.883
Take him and run quickly.

00:34:55.384 --> 00:34:58.554
Heidi, Su-in, I'll come back to get you!

00:35:55.027 --> 00:35:57.029
-Hey, hurry up and go!
-Mr. Mayor!

00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:58.948
-Are you okay?
-Get him out of here.

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:26.350
Mutant.

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:30.521
When you came to the church,

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:33.983
why did you decide
to side with humans instead of us?

00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:37.904
I did not think
you would accept a mutant like me.

00:36:38.821 --> 00:36:40.364
What made you think that way?

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:45.161
You were too similar to humans.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.372
Similar to humans, I see.

00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.126
Yes, you are right.

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:57.548
Neither I nor humans accept
a mutant like you.

00:36:58.549 --> 00:37:01.928
But that is what makes
the human organization powerful.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.433
They call the majority normal
and the minority of mutants abnormal.

00:37:07.516 --> 00:37:11.187
They strengthen the organization
by obtaining the support of the majority.

00:37:11.687 --> 00:37:13.147
And the great life form,

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:16.275
called the human organization,
born in this way

00:37:16.984 --> 00:37:21.530
possesses a power that is incomparable
to a life form that is fragile like us.

00:37:22.782 --> 00:37:27.328
Human organizations sacrifice
many people for a single purpose.

00:37:29.997 --> 00:37:33.334
And after they achieve their goal,

00:37:35.002 --> 00:37:38.589
they commemorate the one person
who served as their leader.

00:37:40.841 --> 00:37:42.802
As you can see in this memorial hall.

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:05.783
Jeong Su-in!

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:11.956
Heidi.

00:38:12.748 --> 00:38:15.167
Su-in.

00:38:16.502 --> 00:38:17.336
Goddamn it.

00:38:23.175 --> 00:38:26.846
Do you remember the command we were given
the moment we were born?

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:29.473
"Take over a human brain."

00:38:30.599 --> 00:38:31.809
Maybe it didn't just mean

00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:35.396
to take over the physical head of a human

00:38:36.605 --> 00:38:39.191
but rather to take over
the head of a great creature

00:38:39.275 --> 00:38:41.110
called the human organization.

00:38:54.373 --> 00:38:56.250
Join me now.

00:38:58.085 --> 00:38:59.086
If we join hands,

00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:04.050
we will be able to take over
the head of the human organization.

00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:08.512
Both of you, freeze.

00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:19.482
Shoot her.

00:39:23.986 --> 00:39:26.364
Captain Choi, what are you doing?
Shoot her!

00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:32.620
If you don't want to lose your head,
shoot her!

00:39:33.162 --> 00:39:34.288
Now!

00:40:32.638 --> 00:40:34.890
Did you know I was going to shoot him?

00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:39.937
No. I do not have the ability
to predict such things.

00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:44.442
Then why did you attack him instead of me?

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:47.111
I trusted you.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:53.075
Jeong Su-in is a strange girl.

00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:56.495
She has been hurt
numerous times by humans,

00:40:56.996 --> 00:40:59.915
but no matter what,
she does not give up her trust in them.

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:03.002
Instead, she extends
her hand to others first.

00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:05.337
That is who she is.

00:41:08.507 --> 00:41:09.717
I wanted to copy

00:41:10.718 --> 00:41:12.344
her trust in people.

00:41:16.098 --> 00:41:19.643
Deep inside, Jeong Su-in longs for people.

00:41:21.395 --> 00:41:23.230
She wants to live among people.

00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:27.860
Su-in!

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.947
Jeong Su-in! Su-in, are you okay?

00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:35.034
Please take care of Su-in.

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:39.288
Hey! No.

00:41:40.414 --> 00:41:44.293
Su-in. Oh, what do I do? Hey, Jeong Su-in!

00:41:44.376 --> 00:41:45.920
Hey! What the hell happened?

00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:47.338
What the fuck happened?

00:41:47.421 --> 00:41:48.964
Su-in, wake up.

00:41:51.634 --> 00:41:52.468
Captain.

00:41:53.886 --> 00:41:55.763
Take them to the hospital quickly.

00:41:57.223 --> 00:41:59.225
Isn't Jeong Su-in a parasite?

00:42:02.144 --> 00:42:03.938
Those two are just normal humans.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.890
-What are you mewing?
-What?

00:43:25.185 --> 00:43:26.020
I'm working.

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:28.397
When will you be done?

00:43:30.024 --> 00:43:30.858
In two hours?

00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:38.115
You're working too hard.
Isn't it tough on you?

00:43:40.326 --> 00:43:42.328
What about you? How have you been?

00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:43.829
Me?

00:43:44.663 --> 00:43:46.332
I joined a new organization.

00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:50.252
You joined another one
after all you've been through?

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:52.838
It's not like I can start one myself.

00:43:54.214 --> 00:43:56.175
I can't be a lone wolf forever.

00:43:56.675 --> 00:43:58.802
Besides, the world is a tough place.

00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:08.520
Here.

00:44:11.523 --> 00:44:12.650
It's impressive, right?

00:44:12.733 --> 00:44:14.485
Seol Kang-woo of Team Grey?

00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:18.155
Captain Choi got me this entire outfit.

00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:19.740
I have insurance now.

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:22.117
Are you jealous?

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.495
I thought about it a lot.

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:27.831
But what choice do I have
but to give it another shot?

00:44:31.126 --> 00:44:31.960
Yeah.

00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:34.088
Good for you.

00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:43.055
What?

00:44:44.306 --> 00:44:45.724
Did you have something to say?

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:49.144
Actually, I received a letter yesterday.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:50.604
The thing is…

00:44:52.606 --> 00:44:54.191
Heidi was the one who sent it.

00:44:56.735 --> 00:44:58.612
She could have left it for you herself,

00:44:58.696 --> 00:45:02.116
but she asked me to read it aloud
for you in a human voice.

00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:04.952
Here we go.

00:45:06.453 --> 00:45:07.621
"Hi, Jeong Su-in."

00:45:09.915 --> 00:45:11.458
Okay, I won't joke around.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.587
"This may sound awkward
since this is my first letter,

00:45:15.671 --> 00:45:17.047
so please understand."

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.134
"I thought about the meaning

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:23.095
of our existence
that our kin had talked about."

00:45:24.263 --> 00:45:26.348
"I have not come to a conclusion yet,

00:45:27.182 --> 00:45:29.685
but I am glad that you are the host

00:45:30.352 --> 00:45:34.565
that I parasitized and that I failed
to fully take over your brain."

00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:42.531
This sentence right here.
You need to read this yourself.

00:45:42.614 --> 00:45:44.408
I can't bring myself to read it.

00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:03.385
Su-in!

00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:07.973
Captain Choi said
she has a spot for you on the team.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.977
Don't be such a loner.
Just give me a call if you wanna join.

00:46:12.728 --> 00:46:13.562
See you.

00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:23.572
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU ARE NOT ALONE

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:52.893
So, who is this person?

00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:55.729
He says he's an investigative journalist

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:59.483
and claims to be the top expert
when it comes to parasites.

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:03.445
And he says
he has some very important information.

00:47:03.529 --> 00:47:05.781
What? Are you sure he's not a nut job?

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:21.755
Thank you for waiting.

00:47:22.464 --> 00:47:25.425
This is Captain Choi Jun-kyung,
the leader of Team Grey.

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:27.177
Who are you?

00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:31.431
Hello, my name is Shinichi Izumi.

00:50:09.297 --> 00:50:14.302
