<b>Ever since Itoshi Rin started playing soccer, he's held a special admiration 
for his big brother, Itoshi Sae. Sae's presence has played a big role in Rin's
motivation for the sport. However, in the winter of Rin's third year of
junior high school, he started becoming stricter with himself and ended
up alienating others as a result.

Rin shows clear hostility toward Itoshi Sae, and it can be surmised that his
current motivation stems from a desire to surpass his brother. Further
investigation is planned on the matter.</b>

08:25.020 --> 08:30.530
<b><i>The remaining 29 players must decide
 which pair they wish to team up with.</i></b>

08:30.530 --> 08:36.820
<b><i>You will make teams of five by 
adding three players to the Top 6 duos.</i></b>

08:36.820 --> 08:39.620
<b><i>Each team will play one five-a-side match.</i></b>

08:40.540 --> 08:41.750
<b><i>I see.</i></b>

08:42.080 --> 08:47.790
<b><i>He's looking for players who mesh 
with the attacking styles of the Top 6.</i></b>

08:48.130 --> 08:54.470
<b><i>Apart from the Top 6, the 29 of you 
will only get one chance to play.</i></b>

08:54.470 --> 09:01.770
<b><i>These tryouts will determine who makes 
the team for the match against Japan's U-20s.</i></b>

09:02.220 --> 09:05.690
<b>You want us to show 
our presence in one match?</b>

09:05.690 --> 09:08.060
<b>That feels pro-level.</b>

09:08.060 --> 09:10.110
<b>Hah! Bring it on!</b>

09:10.520 --> 09:15.490
<b><i>And because of the headcount, 
one of you will play two games.</i></b>

09:15.490 --> 09:18.990
<b>That'll be No.7, the runner-up.</b>

09:20.530 --> 09:24.160

09:34.260 --> 09:38.180
<b><i>The Top 6 will proceed to another room.</i></b>

<b><i>These rankings only reflect
where everyone stands at present.</i></b>

09:45.520 --> 09:51.730
<b><i>Even the Top 6 can fall off their perch, 
if they flunk the tryouts. Don't forget that.</i></b>

09:54.440 --> 09:57.900
<b><i>Now, here's a message for the remaining 29.</i></b>

09:58.280 --> 10:02.450
<b><i>The key to acing the tryouts is:
 "assertion and coexistence."</i></b>

10:00.780 --> 10:08.750
<b>Assertion and Coexistence</b>

<b><i>Subjugate them!</i></b>

10:19.760 --> 10:24.930
<b><i>For you, the Top 6 aren't

<b>I'm the same.</b>

17:59.520 --> 18:02.980
<b>Huh? I thought your only option
 was Nagi's team.</b>

18:04.440 --> 18:07.690
<b>That's rich coming from the guy
 who drove Nagi and me apart.</b>

18:07.690 --> 18:09.570
<b>Ah. My bad.</b>

18:10.650 --> 18:14.490
<b>That was my plan, but now, I'm not so sure.</b>

18:15.410 --> 18:16.370
<b>How come?</b>

18:17.160 --> 18:22.750
<b>Well, he chose you over me
 in the second selection,</b>

18:23.370 --> 18:28.130
<b>and my desire to get back at him
 has brought me this far.</b>

18:29.630 --> 18:33.880
<b>But watching him making 
his way into the Top 6,</b>

18:34.220 --> 18:37.300
<b>and objectively comparing 
myself to his current level,</b>

18:37.890 --> 18:41.350
<b>it feels like he's going to a place
 where I can't reach him,</b>

18:42.230 --> 18:44.640
<b>and I don't have the confidence 
to play alongside him.</b>

18:46.440 --> 18:49.980
<b>But if I pass up this opportunity, 
I might not get a second chance.</b>

18:51.440 --> 18:56.570
<b>But if I show him how weak I am, 
he may go even further away.</b>

19:00.580 --> 19:02.910
<b>I just don't know what to do right now.</b>

19:05.920 --> 19:07.290

19:08.790 --> 19:09.960
<b>You're right.</b>

19:10.460 --> 19:15.680
<b>If we don't play together now, he might 
become someone that's out of my reach.</b>

19:17.930 --> 19:20.100
<b>That's a regret I don't want to have.</b>

19:21.100 --> 19:23.560

19:23.560 --> 19:25.480

24:18.020 --> 24:20.500
<b>Then, let's do team rock and team paper.</b>

24:20.500 --> 24:22.470
<b>We only need to split into two groups.</b>

24:22.650 --> 24:22.900
<b>Nagi Seishiro</b>

24:22.650 --> 24:22.900
<b>Nagi Seishiro</b>

24:22.900 --> 24:23.070
<b>Nagi Seishiro</b>

24:22.900 --> 24:23.070
<b>Nagi Seishiro</b>

24:22.940 --> 24:25.400
<b>Yeah, no. That doesn't excite me.</b>

24:23.020 --> 24:28.200
<b>Shidou Ryusei</b>

24:23.020 --> 24:28.200
<b>Shidou Ryusei</b>

24:23.070 --> 24:31.570
<b>Nagi Seishiro</b>

24:23.070 --> 24:31.570
<b>Nagi Seishiro</b>

24:25.400 --> 24:28.340
<b>How about the loser of rock, 
paper, scissors sleeps outside?</b>

24:28.200 --> 24:28.450
<b>Shidou Ryusei</b>

24:28.200 --> 24:28.450
<b>Shidou Ryusei</b>

24:28.340 --> 24:29.780
<b>I like that.</b>

24:28.450 --> 24:28.620
<b>Shidou Ryusei</b>

24:28.450 --> 24:28.620
<b>Shidou Ryusei</b>

24:28.530 --> 24:31.570
<b>Otoya Eita</b>

24:28.530 --> 24:31.570
<b>Otoya Eita</b>

24:28.620 --> 24:31.570
<b>Shidou Ryusei</b>

24:28.620 --> 24:31.570
<b>Shidou Ryusei</b>

24:29.780 --> 24:31.570
<b>It's "survival ego-ego 
rock, paper, scissors."</b>

24:32.110 --> 24:34.120
<b>Huh? Sounds like a hassle.</b>

24:34.120 --> 24:36.320
<b>Hell yeah! This is exciting!</b>

24:36.320 --> 24:36.940
<b>Hey.</b>

24:36.940 --> 24:39.710
<b>Ego-ego rock, paper, scissors.
Rock, paper...</b>

24:38.090 --> 24:39.220
<b>Hey.</b>

24:39.710 --> 24:40.980
<b>Scissors!</b>

24:39.780 --> 24:40.980
<b>Yeah, super exciting.</b>

24:40.980 --> 24:42.540
<b>Rock, paper, scissors.</b>

24:41.880 --> 24:42.540
<b>Scissors!</b>

24:43.530 --> 24:47.730
<b>How about we all point to the person 
we really do <i>not</i> want to room with?</b>

24:47.730 --> 24:50.970
<b>Then, we'll split in such a way 
that we don't have to room with them.</b>

24:51.470 --> 24:52.390
<b>Sure.</b>

24:52.390 --> 24:53.450
<b>That works.</b>

24:53.450 --> 24:55.210
<b>Okay. Let's do that.</b>

24:55.210 --> 24:57.350
<b>Well, then. Ready, and...</b>

25:02.570 --> 25:04.630
<b>So I get a room to myself.</b>

25:04.630 --> 25:07.590
<b>Uh, no, scratch that. 
Let's change that rule.</b>

25:09.630 --> 25:12.550
<b>Then, I'll room with Rin-kun.</b>

25:12.550 --> 25:16.580
<b>Nagi-kun, I'd like a strategy meeting
 with you, so why don't you join us?</b>

25:17.010 --> 25:19.120
<b>Huh? Guess that's fine.</b>

25:19.790 --> 25:23.880
<b>Disputing it any further would be a hassle, 
so nice rooming with you, Mr. Four-Eyes.</b>

25:24.960 --> 25:26.750
<b>You, too, monster.</b>

25:27.710 --> 25:28.900
<b>I'll room with whoever.</b>

25:28.900 --> 25:31.750
<b><b><i>Yukimiya, Nagi, and Rin are rooming together!</i></b></b>

25:33.760 --> 25:35.960
<b>Nice rooming with you, Spikehead.</b>

25:35.960 --> 25:37.520
<b>Hey, speak for yourself.</b>

25:37.520 --> 25:39.570
<b>Look, I'm a spikehead, too.</b>

25:39.950 --> 25:43.140
<b><b><i>Otoya, Karasu, and Shidou are rooming together!</i></b></b>
