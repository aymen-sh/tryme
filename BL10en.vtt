<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

00:26.420 --> 00:28.350

00:28.820 --> 00:32.180
<b>Having a rough time of it,

00:32.510 --> 00:35.300

00:36.030 --> 00:41.270
<b>Let's find out who's <i>really </i>

00:41.270 --> 00:43.980
<b>H-Hey now. Stop that, Shidou.</b>

00:44.250 --> 00:47.050
<b>Oh, perfect timing.</b>

00:47.430 --> 00:53.690
<b>I was looking for a scrub to clown on to add

<b>Right back at ya, big brudda's boy.</b>

01:00.120 --> 01:05.000
<b>Shidou Ryusei is replacing

01:05.000 --> 01:07.030
<b>We have zero information on him.</b>

01:07.030 --> 01:09.540
<b>What style of play will he show us?</b>

01:09.910 --> 01:11.360
<b><i>I can't wait to find out!</i></b>

01:13.160 --> 01:17.220

<b>Blue Lock XI</b>

03:20.400 --> 03:24.810
<b><i>Shidou-kun's weapon is his unerring ability
 to score when he gets near the box.</i></b>

03:24.810 --> 03:26.960
<b><i>I can't let him out of my sight.</i></b>

03:29.360 --> 03:31.990
<b><i>When he receives it in front 
of goal, that's my chance.</i></b>

03:32.460 --> 03:35.610
<b><i>I will hunt him down on that final line.</i></b>

03:35.610 --> 03:37.690
<b>Heartbeats. Energy.</b>

03:38.640 --> 03:40.100
<b>I'm zipping through!</b>

03:40.420 --> 03:41.610
<b>He's going berserk?</b>

03:41.610 --> 03:43.610
<b><i>Wh-What's with that movement?</i></b>

03:43.610 --> 03:45.570
<b><i>He's ignoring both teams' formations.</i></b>

03:50.830 --> 03:51.880
<b><i>For real?</i></b>

03:52.390 --> 03:54.710
<b><i>His movement is even

03:55.380 --> 03:58.050
<b><i>For him, the game isn't 11-on-11.</i></b>

03:58.810 --> 04:01.010

<b><i>A-Are you kidding me?</i></b>

04:05.090 --> 04:07.810
<b><i>That's such a tight gap,

04:07.810 --> 04:09.520
<b>All righty.</b>

04:09.520 --> 04:11.480
<b>Blue Lock XI</b>

04:09.850 --> 04:11.480
<b>No, I can get to it!</b>

04:12.980 --> 04:15.300

<b>Shidou!</b>

04:17.390 --> 04:18.860
<b>Sendou?</b>

04:19.140 --> 04:21.070

<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

04:22.400 --> 04:25.410
<b>I'm just doing what Itoshi Sae told me to do.</b>

04:25.690 --> 04:28.030
<b><i>He's changed roles since the first half.</i></b>

04:28.640 --> 04:31.660
<b><i>He's now a decoy in support of Shidou?</i></b>

04:31.710 --> 04:36.420
<b><i>Which means he's kinda 
like what Isagi is to Rin.</i></b>

04:36.460 --> 04:40.960
<b><i>Damn it! No one expected a combo like this!</i></b>

04:40.960 --> 04:45.380
<b>If it means victory to us, 
I'll play just like you want me to!</b>

04:45.380 --> 04:47.090
<b><i>He squared it already?</i></b>

04:49.080 --> 04:50.060
<b><i>Oh, crap.</i></b>

04:50.390 --> 04:52.270
<b><i>Lurking on the edge of the box...</i></b>

05:00.850 --> 05:02.190
<b><i>A snap shot?</i></b>

05:02.440 --> 05:04.570
<b><i>Is he shooting reflexively?</i></b>

05:09.540 --> 05:10.740
<b><i>No, not a shot...</i></b>

05:12.140 --> 05:15.750
<b><i>A curling cross? It's a pinpoint pass!</i></b>

05:15.750 --> 05:17.790
<b>There you go, Devil Boy.</b>

05:18.220 --> 05:19.950
<b>I love me some nasty ones.</b>

05:20.310 --> 05:24.050
<b><i>With the addition of Shidou, their attack
 has been drastically rejuvenated.</i></b>

05:26.370 --> 05:27.670
<b><i>This is bad.</i></b>

05:27.670 --> 05:31.810
<b><i>Japan's U-20s are waking up!</i></b>

05:31.810 --> 05:33.600

05:36.240 --> 05:37.310
<b>Niko?</b>

05:40.810 --> 05:43.030
<b>Thank you, Niko!</b>

05:43.980 --> 05:46.860
<b><i>Ah, that dangerous tackle caught his foot.</i></b>

<b><i>Blue Lock XI's Niko Ikki

<b><i>But man, this is amazing.</i></b>

05:52.860 --> 05:58.290
<b>That No. 13... Shidou, right? 
He's coordinating with Itoshi Sae.</b>

05:59.030 --> 06:02.750
<b>You little eye-hiding gnome. Damn you.</b>

06:03.010 --> 06:05.840
<b>Sorry for stepping on you, Mr. Pest.</b>

06:06.550 --> 06:07.930
<b>Oh, you're <i>so</i> dead!</b>

06:07.930 --> 06:09.970
<b>Knock it off, idiot.</b>

06:11.470 --> 06:14.100
<b>Gonna throw away your career
 by getting sent off?</b>

06:14.490 --> 06:16.780
<b>Show your worth with some goals.</b>

06:17.240 --> 06:19.980
<b>Don't make me any more disappointed in you.</b>

06:21.560 --> 06:23.880
<b>Well, thank you kindly.</b>

06:25.710 --> 06:27.630
<b>Great job getting there, Niko.</b>

06:27.630 --> 06:29.150
<b>Nice defending.</b>

06:29.660 --> 06:32.700
<b>But I could only stop him by fouling him.</b>

06:32.700 --> 06:33.620
<b>Huh?</b>

06:34.330 --> 06:37.190
<b>Itoshi Sae's movement and 
Shidou-kun's off-the-ball running.</b>

06:37.700 --> 06:42.580
<b>I read what they were doing and 
pinpointed the most dangerous spot.</b>

06:42.580 --> 06:45.360
<b>I saw all of it ahead of time, and still...</b>

06:45.850 --> 06:46.920
<b>You...</b>

06:47.660 --> 06:49.620
<b>But Sendou-kun was an extra wrinkle.</b>

06:50.480 --> 06:55.370
<b>He ran into an awkward space for us, 
as if complementing Shidou-kun's movement.</b>

06:55.370 --> 06:59.940
<b>That momentarily delayed my assessment
and led me to getting a yellow card.</b>

07:00.550 --> 07:04.080
<b>Sendou-kun changed his style of play
as soon as Shidou-kun came on.</b>

07:04.700 --> 07:10.200
<b>He might not be flashy, 
but his presence is noise to us right now.</b>

07:10.770 --> 07:13.460
<b><i>He can see all that?</i></b>

07:16.120 --> 07:17.380
<b>Are you okay?</b>

07:17.380 --> 07:19.580
<b>Did you injure yourself just now?</b>

07:19.580 --> 07:21.390
<b>Please leave me alone.</b>

07:21.390 --> 07:22.420
<b>I can still play.</b>

07:23.830 --> 07:25.500
<b>I want to do this.</b>

07:27.390 --> 07:30.290
<b>It pains me that I didn't 
get chosen as a striker,</b>

07:30.660 --> 07:35.100
<b>but with these eyes and that move 
just now, I kind of started to see...</b>

07:36.050 --> 07:40.270
<b>how fun it is to trample
a forward as a defender.</b>

07:44.160 --> 07:45.480
<b>Isagi-kun.</b>

07:46.680 --> 07:51.350
<b>Ever since I met you, 
I haven't been afraid of changing myself.</b>

07:53.520 --> 07:56.230
<b>We're going to win this game.</b>

07:56.940 --> 07:57.700

08:09.070 --> 08:11.170
<b>Who the hell is that No. 13?</b>

08:11.170 --> 08:13.590
<b>It's gotta be Itoshi Sae taking it, no question.</b>

08:15.110 --> 08:17.860
<b>You'd better keep it out, Blue Lock.</b>

08:20.640 --> 08:22.950
<b>I'll be taking this one, Sae-chan.</b>

08:23.320 --> 08:28.320
<b>The path to goal you want to take 
is blocked by your pesky little brother.</b>

08:29.660 --> 08:31.250
<b>Too close. Too crowded.</b>

08:32.920 --> 08:34.820
<b>You have no path to goal either, do you?</b>

08:34.820 --> 08:40.200
<b>Shut up. I won this free kick, so I'm taking it.</b>

08:41.650 --> 08:43.680
<b>Is that the best course of action?</b>

08:43.680 --> 08:44.670
<b>Huh?</b>

08:45.460 --> 08:50.130
<b>I'm asking if that's the best option 
you can see with those eyes.</b>

08:50.440 --> 08:51.410
<b>Huh?</b>

08:52.390 --> 08:57.300
<b>A move that's realistically possible, 
and an ideal move you want to execute.</b>

08:57.810 --> 09:00.850

09:11.880 --> 09:15.050
<b>You're giving me shivers, Sae-chan.</b>

09:15.050 --> 09:18.320
<b>Okay, I've come up with a killer move.</b>

09:18.700 --> 09:22.390
<b>But it's gonna be a

09:22.390 --> 09:24.190
<b>You sure you'll keep up?</b>

09:25.360 --> 09:27.120

<b><i>The kicker will be Shidou!</i></b>

09:49.440 --> 09:51.320
<b><i>He ran past it and kept going?</i></b>

09:51.650 --> 09:53.210
<b><i>A fake-out?</i></b>

<b><i>So the shooter's...</i></b>

09:55.570 --> 09:57.030
<b><i>Itoshi Sae!</i></b>

09:58.110 --> 09:59.570
<b><i>No, he isn't!</i></b>

<b><i>Are you serious?</i></b>

10:30.810 --> 10:35.570
<b><i>An inch away from

10:36.880 --> 10:39.030

<b><i>My word! Japan's U-20s'

11:42.900 --> 11:45.170
<b>Getting high on brain juice!</b>

11:45.170 --> 11:48.560
<b>Ah, I'm coming. Ka-sploosh.</b>

11:48.560 --> 11:52.020
<b>We're still only level,

11:52.280 --> 11:55.610
<b>Yikes, that one was impossible to stop.</b>

11:55.610 --> 11:59.110
<b>That was the chemical reaction 
between Itoshi Sae and Shidou Ryusei.</b>

12:00.250 --> 12:03.570
<b><i>That set play was way too nasty.</i></b>

12:04.210 --> 12:09.240
<b><i>Shidou probably ran at full speed to 
the place he envisioned shooting from.</i></b>

12:09.780 --> 12:12.290
<b><i>Reading it, Chigiri went to intercept him.</i></b>

12:12.850 --> 12:14.420
<b><i>But Itoshi Sae...</i></b>

12:14.830 --> 12:18.670
<b><i>assessed Chigiri's speed, 
the spot Shidou wanted to be in,</i></b>

12:18.670 --> 12:21.670
<b><i>and the speed and quality of his own pass.</i></b>

12:22.000 --> 12:27.480
<b><i>He assessed it all in an instant and 
hit a pass through the eye of a needle.</i></b>

12:30.660 --> 12:33.150
<b><i>"He assessed it all in an instant."</i></b>

12:33.500 --> 12:37.800
<b><i>Isn't that the kind of reflex
I've been looking for?</i></b>

12:38.520 --> 12:41.650
<b><i>And the same with Shidou's jumping volley.</i></b>

12:42.490 --> 12:46.220
<b><i>Both brain and body need to act 
on reflex to score a goal like that.</i></b>

12:46.680 --> 12:48.500
<b><i>It's reflex multiplied by reflex.</i></b>

12:49.160 --> 12:55.210
<b><i>Superhuman plays by Itoshi Sae and Shidou Ryusei
stacked on one another to make that goal.</i></b>

12:55.830 --> 12:59.070
<b><i>Blue Lock couldn't handle Shidou's vision.</i></b>

12:59.440 --> 13:03.070

responded with an exquisite pass.</i></b>

13:03.660 --> 13:08.240
<b><i>Plus, for these two, 
this is just the prologue.</i></b>

13:08.240 --> 13:11.730
<b>Lovely stuff, Mr. Long Bottom

13:11.730 --> 13:13.550
<b>Give me your info later.</b>

13:13.550 --> 13:16.900
<b>Hm? I'll think about it 
if you score a hat-trick.</b>

13:16.900 --> 13:19.310
<b>You mean it? That's a promise.</b>

13:19.940 --> 13:24.720
<b><i>If we don't stop them, they'll come 
straight back and run away with the match.</i></b>

13:27.560 --> 13:28.420
<b>Chigiri!</b>

13:32.890 --> 13:34.150
<b>Hey, are you okay?</b>

13:34.630 --> 13:37.620
<b>Yeah. Just a little cramp.</b>

13:39.460 --> 13:41.660
<b>There's still ages left on the clock.</b>

13:44.370 --> 13:45.970
<b>I guess it's time.</b>

13:47.470 --> 13:52.350
<b>A center back who got a yellow for 
a last-ditch tackle that hurt his own ankle.</b>

13:52.890 --> 13:57.100
<b>A drained fleet-footed full-back 
who has sprinted more than anyone so far.</b>

13:57.580 --> 14:03.150
<b>And the U-20s have been reborn due to 
the power of Itoshi Sae and Shidou Ryusei.</b>

14:05.040 --> 14:07.410
<b>It's time to bring on some subs.</b>

14:08.340 --> 14:09.610
<b>Understood.</b>
