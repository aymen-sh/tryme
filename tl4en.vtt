WEBVTT

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.760
We have to do this every hour?

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.760
Gas breaks down over time.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.440
This stuff's almost water.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.840
Back in the day,
we'd drive 10, 12 hours on one tank.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.680
- You could go anywhere.
- So where'd you go?

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.840
Pretty much nowhere.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.480
Nice! How does that work?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.760
It's a siphon.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.800
It's when liquid...
travels against gravity

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.400
- because pressure...
- You don't know.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.760
I know it works.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.600
No wandering.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.760
Okay.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.520
This is your fault then.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.040
"It doesn't matter how much
you push the envelope

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.960
it'll still be stationery."

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.920
No Pun Intended

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.200
Volume Too by Will Livingston.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.120
"Volume Too." Look. You get it?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.320
- "Too"? Like, T-O-O.
- Oh, Jesus.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.400
"What did the mermaid wear
to her math class?"

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.760
"An algae bra."

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.440
Like, algae bra.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.920
- "I stayed up all night
- No.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.080
Wondering where the sun went

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.560
and then it dawned on me."

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.320
- Feel free to wait in the truck.
- Okay

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.440
but just know,
you can't escape Will Livingston.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800
He'll be back.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.920
There's nothing you can do
to stop him.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.200
Must've been some truck.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.056
Yeah, they used to stick
big-ass plows on them

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.960
and clear the roads
for their tanks and such.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.560
I wanna see a tank.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.880
You will.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.760
Tanks, choppers, all that stuff

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.120
but they'll fight the wrong enemy.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.080
Just scattered around now.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.480
I got something.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.920
Here. This make you all nostalgic?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.720
This is actually before my time.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.000
- Great.
- It's a winner, though.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.480
Oh, man.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.600
Got something else.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.720
It's light on the reading,
but it has some interesting pictures.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.000
No... put that back.
That's not for kids. Ellie.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.456
How would he even walk around
with that thing?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.160
- Please get rid of it.
- Hold your horses.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.160
I wanna see
what all the fuss is about.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.760
Why are all these pages
stuck together?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.840
- The...
- I'm just fucking with you.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.720
Bye-bye, dude!

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.800
All right.
That's enough for today.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.720
- Slow down.
- This is slow.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.440
What am I even eating?

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.160
That is 20-year-old
Chef Boyardee ravioli.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.840
- That guy was good.
- I actually agree.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.680
How long are we staying out here?

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.160
I figure I'd sleep tonight

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.800
and drive tomorrow all day,
all night

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.840
get us to Wyoming by next morning.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.520
So can we start a fire?
I'm freezing.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.080
Now, why am I gonna tell you no?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.160
Because infected will see the smoke.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.160
No. Fungus isn't that smart.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.880
This is too remote
for infected, anyway.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.400
People?

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.880
So, what are they gonna do?
Rob us?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.960
Well, they'll have
way more in mind than that.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.720
Okay.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.560
Actually smells kind of good.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.680
Well, that would be Frank's then.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.440
Joel.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.880
- Joel!
- What?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.520
- Can I ask you a serious question?
- Yeah.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.240
Why did the scarecrow get an award?

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.160
Because he was outstanding
in his field.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.280
You dick!

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.320
- Did you read this?
- No.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.400
Now go to sleep.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.440
Those people you said...

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.760
there's no way
anyone knows we're here, right?

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.560
No one's gonna find us.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.920
No one's gonna find us.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.000
Okay.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.080
What the fuck is that?

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.000
You don't like coffee?

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.520
Is that seriously what those
Starbucks in the QZ used to sell?

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.296
Well, theirs was a lot fresher
than what Bill saved up

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.000
but, yeah, this is what they sold.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.800
Smells like... burnt shit.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.640
Eyes on the map.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.000
76 west, and then...

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.840
70 west for, like, ever.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.480
Where in Wyoming
did you say your brother was?

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.640
Last contact came through
a radio tower close to Cody.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.920
Cody.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.720
Cody... Cody. Man.
That is deep up in there.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.720
- Yeah.
- And if he's not there?

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.200
Then odds are
he'll be near a settlement

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.816
probably close to another city
out there.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.176
Ain't too many of them in Wyoming.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.400
Chee-Yen.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.120
- Cheyenne.
- Che... Really?

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.560
Cheyenne, Laramie...

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.080
Casper?

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.640
What's his name?

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.080
- Whose name?
- Your brother.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.200
- Tommy.
- Younger or older?

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.040
- Younger.
- Why isn't he with you?

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.480
- A long story.
- Is it longer than 25 hours?

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.160
Because I think that's what we got.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.840
Tommy's what
we used to call a joiner.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.800
Dreams of becoming a hero.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.640
So he enlisted in the Army
right out of high school.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.400
A few months later,
they ship him off to Desert Storm.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.136
It's what they called that war.
It doesn't matter.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.960
Point is, being in the Army didn't
make him feel much like a hero.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.720
Cut to 12 years later,
outbreak happens.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.440
He convinces me to join a group
making their way up to Boston

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.920
which I did,
mostly to keep an eye on him

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.200
keep him alive.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.920
It's where we met Tess.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.720
And that whole crew, we...

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.560
Well, for what it was, it worked.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.760
And then Tommy meets Marlene.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.320
She talks him
into joining the Fireflies.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.280
Same mistake he made when he was 18.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.960
Wants to save the world.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.120
Pipe dream.
Him, Fireflies, all of them...

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.360
delusional.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.480
'Course, last I heard,
he quit the Fireflies too.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.680
So now he's on his own
out there and...

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.680
I gotta go get him.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.856
If you don't think
there's hope for the world

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.280
why bother going on?

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.120
I mean, you gotta try, right?

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.760
You haven't seen the world,
so you don't know.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.840
You keep going for family.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.240
- That's about it.
- I'm not family.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.560
No.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.080
You're cargo.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.080
And I made a promise to Tess.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.680
And she was like family.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.440
- What if you don't find him?
- I will.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.320
- How do you know?
- I'm persistent.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.696
You got up pretty early.
If you wanna grab more sleep...

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.240
I'm not even tired.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.000
Stay put.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.400
- Where are we?
- Kansas City.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.240
How far back do we have to go
to get around this?

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.240
Screw it.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.520
What are you doing?

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.200
We can jog right around this tunnel

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.760
take the next ramp

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.720
and we're back on the road,
minute tops.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.400
Where the fuck is the highway?

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.256
I can't tell from this.
I'm all turned around.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.976
Don't look at the state map.
Look at the inset.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.136
I don't know
where we are in that either!

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.520
This is my second day
in a fucking car, man.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.360
I mean, I think we're heading north?

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.840
It's gotta be the right.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.120
What the fuck?

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.400
Stop!

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.240
Is that the QZ?

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.160
Where the fuck is FEDRA?

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.720
Hey!

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.760
Please help!

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.240
Put your seatbelt on.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.960
- Aren't we gonna help him?
- No.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.320
Fuck!

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.000
- Go... go!
- Joel!

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.000
Fuck!

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.800
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.720
- You're not hurt? Nothing?
- I don't think so.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.200
Belts off. Fast!

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.840
Let's see you, motherfucker!

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.160
Give us your shit,
you'll make it through this!

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.440
We promise!

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.000
Hey, you see that hole?

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.800
Can you squeeze through?

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.680
Last chance!

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.680
When I say go,
you crawl to that wall

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.056
and you squeeze through,
and you don't come out

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.960
until I say, okay?

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.176
And they're not gonna hit you.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.280
Look at me!

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.880
They're not gonna hit you.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.120
You stay down, you stay low,
you stay quiet.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.240
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.080
Go!

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.200
Fuck!

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.080
You motherfucker!

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.520
Now you're gonna fucking pay!

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.640
What you fucking did?

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.840
You fucking killed yourself,
motherfucker!

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.200
No...! It's okay. It's okay.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.960
It's over.
We're not fighting anymore.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.720
I'm gonna go home.
I'll tell everyone you're good.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.520
I don't know what to do.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.560
My legs don't work.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.600
My mom isn't far,
if you can get me to her.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.800
We could trade with you guys.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.040
We could be friends. I didn't know.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.120
I'm Bryan. I'm Bryan.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.440
What's your name?

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.000
Wait...

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.320
You can have it. It's a good knife.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.040
Get back behind the wall.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.360
No... I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.960
Please... we could just talk.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.400
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.760
Please, please. No... please!
No, please! Please! I'm sorry!

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.320
I'm sorry! Please!

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.680
You don't have to.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.640
Please! No... we can just talk.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.240
We can just talk. Mom... Mom!

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.800
Ellie, I gotta get in there.
I can't fit through.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.760
There's some stuff against the door.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.160
Can you move it?

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.600
- Let's go. Fast.
- Right.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.000
I'm okay.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.200
I'm good.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.000
I got some food in here still,
and I got your light still.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.680
What now?

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.000
- We go up.
- To get a better look?

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.200
Hopefully, we spot a clear route out.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.800
Stay close.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.240
Got it.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.680
Bryan! Bryan!

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.320
Body, body!

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.680
They got fucking Bryan!

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.400
I told you. I was alone.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.760
I haven't seen any of those people
since that night.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.360
What else do you want me to say?

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.080
I don't know. The truth?

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.600
Kathleen.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.760
The Bergquists, hmm? No?

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.440
Mark Anthony Halpin.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.920
Carrie Schreiber.
You haven't seen them?

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.800
The Chans. Henry Burrell.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.480
Okay.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.520
You know where Henry is.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.000
"Lawyer.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.600
Medical attention.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.200
Family visit."

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.720
I wonder if this is the cell

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.440
where my brother was beaten to death.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.200
Oh, you were wronged.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.240
And I'm sorry.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.760
But this has gone too far.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.640
It has to stop.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.920
It has to stop now, you mean?

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.280
Now that you're in the cell.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.120
But before, people dying was okay.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.000
When you were safe and protected

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.640
and ratting on your neighbors
to FEDRA.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.600
They put a gun to my head.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.680
There.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.720
Have I satisfied
the necessary conditions

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.720
- for you to talk?
- Kathleen, for God's sake.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.240
I delivered you.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.080
I held you in my hands.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.480
I never told them anything
about your brother.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.920
But Henry did.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.600
And we know
that he's still in the city.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.480
And I think that you know that too.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.840
Where is he?

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.320
You think I won't do it?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.520
I'm your doctor.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.080
Who did this?

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.480
We think it was outsiders.
We found a truck, loaded.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.120
It's not a FEDRA vehicle,
but they were heavily supplied.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.560
Could be mercs.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.240
Well, if Henry has a radio,
maybe he found someone out there.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.640
Maybe he called these guys in.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.120
Will he live?

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.840
What if I had a doctor?

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.320
There's no chance. I'm sorry.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.880
Open it.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.600
This is Henry's work.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.320
Understand?

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.520
And he won't stop until we stop him.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.600
Find who did this.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.000
Find every collaborator

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.320
and kill them all.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.720
They're not FEDRA,
and they're not Fireflies.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.200
So who are they?

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.960
People.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.480
Are we okay in here?

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.080
For a little bit, maybe.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.560
Looks like they're checking out
apartment buildings first.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.560
But they'll be coming through
these places soon enough.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.080
There's a really tall building, like,
four blocks away.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.120
- Yeah, saw it.
- So that's the one?

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.640
As soon as we don't hear a truck,
we move.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.080
Fast as we can.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.720
Are you okay?

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.080
I'm all right.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.760
Are you all right?

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.040
Yeah.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.120
Thing is, is I didn't hear
that guy coming, and...

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.080
You shouldn't have had to...

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.720
- You know.
- Well, you're glad I did, right?

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.440
You're just a kid.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.760
You shouldn't know
what it means to...

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.080
It's not like you killed him.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.320
But...

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.520
shooting or...

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.200
I know what it's like

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.840
the first time that you hurt

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.400
someone like that.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.120
If you...

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.656
- I'm not good at this.
- Yeah, you really aren't.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.160
I mean, it was my fault.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.040
You shouldn't have had to...

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.400
and I'm sorry.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.320
It wasn't my first time.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.920
Show me your grip.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.680
Finger off the trigger.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.040
- Now, who taught you that?
- FEDRA school.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.360
Figures.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.800
Your thumb

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.720
over your thumb.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.320
Left hand,
squeezes down on the right.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.880
You got it?

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.640
There you go.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.120
Look it.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.160
Okay?

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.800
You put it in your pack.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.040
You'll shoot your damn ass off.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.840
We'll get through this.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.680
I know.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.560
No sign of them. You?

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.800
Yeah.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.400
They're out of food.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.240
Henry won't let Sam starve.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.520
Double the guards
around our provisions.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.000
- He's fucking close. I can feel it.
- Yeah.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.640
What?

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.080
Fuck.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.000
Fuck.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.440
When do we tell the others?

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.880
Not yet.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.080
Let's just handle
what we have to handle.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.800
- We can deal with this after.
- Kathleen.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.120
After.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.960
Seal off the building for now.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.760
Okay?

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.680
Yeah.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.880
You're just gonna put your foot here.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.760
One, two...

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.760
- Oh, shit...
- Straighten up. I got you.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.360
- Okay, I'm in.
- Take a look around first.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.040
Ellie.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.880
Goddamn it.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.520
Where would you be without me, huh?

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.000
- By now, Wyoming.
- Oh, yeah. Walked into that one.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.720
All right, we'll make our way up

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.920
and come morning, I'll take a look
at the city and find our way out.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.440
- We're going up 42 flights?
- 45.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.560
But no.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.880
- Not all the way.
- How far?

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.400
As far as I can make it.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.760
Hey, you know that guy
who said he was hurt?

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.840
How did you know it was an ambush?

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.160
I've been on both sides.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.360
It was a long time ago.
We did what we needed to survive.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.920
You and Tess?

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.960
And the people we were with.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.640
My brother too.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.080
Did you kill innocent people?

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.160
Come on.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.560
Holy shit.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.120
- Yeah.
- 33 floors. That's good.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.160
It's gonna have to be.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.360
- Come on.
- Give me a minute.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.400
Get up, you lazy ass.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.160
Lazy ass.
56 years old, you little shit.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.000
Joel?

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.960
Joel.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.160
Joel!

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.760
- What?
- What are you doing?

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.936
I don't want someone
sneaking up on us

00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.960
while we're sleeping.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.920
Oh, I get it. Crunch...

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.336
Are you sure you're gonna hear it?

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.320
Of course, I'll hear it.
That's the damn point.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.600
Okay.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.720
Well, good night.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.680
Yeah, good night.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.480
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.960
When we were talking
about hurting people

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.040
what did you mean
it wasn't your first time?

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.080
I don't want to talk about it.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.240
All right.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.360
You don't have to.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.520
I'm just saying...

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.960
it isn't fair, your age

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.840
having to deal with all of this.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.800
So it gets easier when you get older?

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.880
No, not really.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.440
But still.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.720
The reason I asked whether
you'd hear the glass or not

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.216
is because I've noticed
you don't hear too well

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.640
from your right side.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.800
Is it 'cause you were shot there?

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.880
Probably more from shooting.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.600
So if you wanna keep your hearing,
you stick to that knife.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.760
Joel?

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.640
Did you know diarrhea is hereditary?

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.760
- What?
- Yeah.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.080
It runs in your jeans.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.720
Jesus.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.920
That is so goddamn stupid.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.800
- You laughed, motherfucker.
- I didn't laugh.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.120
- Yes, you did.
- Jesus, I'm losing it.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.240
You're losing it big time.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.280

- You go to sleep.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.800

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.960
Joel!
