00:10.700 --> 00:13.960
Whoa, look over there! That's Baek 
Yoonho from the White Tiger Guild!

00:13.960 --> 00:16.520
Choi Jong-in from the Hunters Guild, too!

00:17.300 --> 00:19.370
Look at all the press.

00:19.370 --> 00:21.630
What are they even here for?

00:21.630 --> 00:24.950
Are the two of you here 
to recruit Lee Minsung?

00:24.950 --> 00:26.880
<i>Minsung? Who are they talking about?</i>

00:24.950 --> 00:27.570
What's the likelihood that 
he'll be retiring from acting?

00:27.570 --> 00:30.300
I'm not here for him.

00:27.570 --> 00:30.300
Do you have any comment on his assessment?

00:30.300 --> 00:34.670
I understand that Mr. Minsung has contracted 
with the Reaper Guild already,

00:34.670 --> 00:36.520
so this is a separate matter.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.810
Damn...

00:37.810 --> 00:39.680
It would've spiced the story up.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.910
What a waste of time.

00:41.910 --> 00:43.560
I've heard the news.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.500
That A-Rank gate that nearly hit the 
S-Rank threshold was real trouble, huh?

00:47.500 --> 00:53.570
Nothing as serious as the red gate that 
cost the White Tigers a rookie A-Rank.

00:53.570 --> 00:57.190
I heard you were on the verge 
of giving us a call, though.

00:57.190 --> 01:00.400
He's the reason why that wasn't necessary.

01:00.400 --> 01:05.470
The Hunters Guild is prepared to give him 
a very warm welcome as a show of gratitude.

01:05.470 --> 01:10.710
Don't be ridiculous! He saved our people, 
too! And after a casualty, at that!

01:13.610 --> 01:18.190
Do you really need more S-Ranks? 
Are you looking to start a war?

01:18.190 --> 01:21.890
I could say the same thing to you!

01:23.780 --> 01:26.820
Hey, if it isn't Jong-in and Yoonho.

01:26.820 --> 01:31.590
You boys aren't here to try and 
snatch Minsung from us, are you?

01:31.590 --> 01:35.200
Like I said, I don't give a damn 
about Minsung or Min-<i>anyone</i>!

01:31.590 --> 01:35.200
I already said, I don't care 
about Minsung or Min-<i>anyone</i>!

01:35.620 --> 01:38.610
Damn, you guys are in sync.

01:39.210 --> 01:41.460
Uh, I'm here for my reassessment.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.270
What's going on?

03:14.640 --> 03:17.050
Check it out! It's Minsung's press conference!

03:17.350 --> 03:18.670
The actor?

03:18.670 --> 03:21.210
He's supposed to be a total playboy.

03:21.210 --> 03:23.220
They call him the co-star killer.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.220
What are they talking about?

03:23.220 --> 03:25.020
Is he giving a public apology?

03:23.220 --> 03:25.020
Don't care.

03:25.460 --> 03:28.600
I'd like to thank you all for gathering today.

03:28.930 --> 03:34.370
As you're all aware, I, Lee Minsung, 
have awakened as a hunter.

03:34.370 --> 03:36.820
I'll be getting my rank assessed today.

03:37.150 --> 03:40.380
Since the day I awakened, 
I've struggled with this decision.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.300
But now I've made up my mind!

03:42.300 --> 03:44.750
To fulfill the destiny 
that I've been born with!

03:45.370 --> 03:51.130
I'll be fighting for Mr. Lim Tae-gyu, 
the guild master of the Reaper Guild!

03:51.130 --> 03:54.260
Are your acting days over?

03:54.260 --> 03:56.190
Isn't this jumping the gun 
before your assessment?

03:56.190 --> 03:58.030
Will you be focusing on your hunter duties?

03:58.760 --> 04:03.430
<i>How gullible can they get? 
I've got my A-Rank already.</i>

04:03.430 --> 04:06.890
<i>My contract with the Reapers is for two years.</i>

04:06.890 --> 04:09.950
<i>I'll dabble in hunting for that time,</i>

04:09.950 --> 04:11.700
<i>people will forget all about my scandals,</i>

04:11.700 --> 04:16.480
<i>and after? I'll be an A-Rank hunter who acts.</i>

04:16.480 --> 04:20.720
No matter what rank I receive, I'm prepared 
to fight as a hunter with my life on the—

04:20.720 --> 04:22.330
What do you think you're doing?!

04:22.330 --> 04:24.220
Can't you see all these reporters?

04:24.220 --> 04:25.990
You're in the way! Buzz off!

04:25.990 --> 04:28.460
Uh, I have business with the Association.

04:28.460 --> 04:29.700
It can wait!

04:29.700 --> 04:32.080
<i>Who is this oblivious idiot?</i>

04:32.420 --> 04:35.250
This entrance is closed! 
Now get out of here—

04:35.250 --> 04:38.360
I'm afraid that isn't your call to make.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.960
Ch-Chairman Go!

04:41.420 --> 04:44.260
This young man is a guest of mine.

04:44.890 --> 04:49.320
I seem to recall asking you to refrain from 
holding a press conference at this hour.

04:49.320 --> 04:53.110
But... I'm trying to distract from my...

04:50.270 --> 04:53.110
Right this way, Hunter Sung.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.570
<i>What the hell do I do now?</i>

04:59.090 --> 05:02.530
I'll be right back! I just need to 
confirm with the Association!

05:05.120 --> 05:08.640
There's someone else being 
reassessed at the moment.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.170
I'm afraid you can't enter 
until it's complete.

05:12.180 --> 05:14.950
Dude, do you know who I am?

05:14.950 --> 05:17.110
One word from me, 
and you'll be out on your—

05:17.110 --> 05:19.920
I can't say I recognize you,

05:19.920 --> 05:25.010
but I don't appreciate 
your lack of consideration.

05:29.710 --> 05:33.850
After hearing about today, 
they came to await your results.

05:34.360 --> 05:39.590
I'm sure they're interested in the first 
S-Rank hunter to appear in two years.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.310
Before we begin the reassessment,

05:46.310 --> 05:49.630
I'd like to confirm the nature 
of your hunter abilities.

05:49.630 --> 05:52.500
What kind of powers do 
you have, Hunter Sung?

05:52.500 --> 05:54.670
I can produce these.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.980
I... assume this is a summon?

06:00.980 --> 06:03.800
Then you have summoning magic.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.240
That... sounds right, sure.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.010
Hunter Sung.

06:08.010 --> 06:11.190
I've received a detailed account of 
your abilities from Manager Woo.

06:11.190 --> 06:13.980
You're not going to hold out on us, are you?

06:14.230 --> 06:17.560
<i>Yeah, I guess the cat's out 
of the bag at this point.</i>

06:23.740 --> 06:26.740
I can produce around a hundred more.

06:26.740 --> 06:28.630
A h-hundred?!

06:28.630 --> 06:30.290
That's unbelievable!

06:31.990 --> 06:34.080
<i>His magic power is tremendous!</i>

06:34.080 --> 06:36.290
<i>It's enough to overwhelm even me...</i>

06:37.300 --> 06:41.160
<i>This is Hunter Sung's power?!</i>

06:44.200 --> 06:48.220
Thank you for your patience. 
Your reassessment is now complete.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.990
This is your new hunter ID.

06:51.390 --> 06:55.470
<i>Perfect. Now I can sell the Sphere of Avarice 
without raising any eyebrows.</i>

06:55.470 --> 07:00.220
<i>That should cover the gear I need 
to beat the Demon's Castle!</i>

07:00.220 --> 07:05.070
You are now officially an S-Rank hunter.

07:05.460 --> 07:10.570
I'm looking forward to seeing 
what you do with that strength.

07:15.210 --> 07:18.040
Congratulations on your S-Rank assessment.

07:18.040 --> 07:22.240
Would you mind letting me thank you 
for your help the other day?

07:22.240 --> 07:24.830
I've got something I'd like 
to discuss with you, as well.

07:24.830 --> 07:27.350
If you could spare some of your time...

07:27.350 --> 07:29.910
Sorry. I've actually got something 
to attend to right now.

07:29.910 --> 07:31.100
Hang on, there's still—

07:31.450 --> 07:32.970
<i>Huh? What did he...</i>

07:37.020 --> 07:39.000
Uh, hey...

07:39.450 --> 07:41.190
Hmm?

07:41.190 --> 07:44.100
Hey. Hey, pay attention!

07:44.100 --> 07:45.390
What?

07:45.390 --> 07:48.700
That's Jinwoo—uh, your brother on the stream.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.930
Huh?

07:53.450 --> 07:55.710
No way! How?!

07:56.160 --> 08:00.430
<i>We've only just been able 
to confirm this information.</i>

07:57.160 --> 07:59.350
He really did make the news.

07:59.350 --> 08:04.170
I tried to tell you! He's got a killer's eyes!

08:00.430 --> 08:04.170
<i>It's been one hour since Chairman Go appeared,</i>

08:04.170 --> 08:06.630
No telling what kind of 
messed-up stuff he's done!

08:04.170 --> 08:06.630
<i>accompanying him to his reassessment...</i>

08:06.630 --> 08:10.550
<i>and now Hunter Sung has been 
officially named as S-Rank.</i>

08:10.550 --> 08:12.940
<i>The Association's database has been updated,</i>

08:12.940 --> 08:17.300
<i>and while there has been no announcement, 
it seems his S-Rank status is confirmed.</i>

08:17.300 --> 08:18.690
<i>He is now</i>

08:18.690 --> 08:20.850
<i>the 10th S-Rank hunter in the country—</i>

08:20.850 --> 08:24.820
<i>the first to emerge in the 
two years since Hunter Cha.</i>

08:27.900 --> 08:28.860
An S-Rank?!

08:28.860 --> 08:30.230
W-Wait—

08:28.860 --> 08:30.240
He's the tenth S-Rank!

08:30.240 --> 08:31.690
Hurry! Get after him!

08:30.240 --> 08:32.590
But... my press conference...

08:32.590 --> 08:33.700
Don't let him get away!

08:35.240 --> 08:38.730
I wasn't able to get Mr. Sung 
to accept the offer.

08:38.730 --> 08:39.750
I see.

08:41.930 --> 08:42.960
<i>Sorry.</i>

08:43.410 --> 08:46.970
There's still something I need 
to take care of on my own.

08:47.740 --> 08:52.210
And to do that, I need to keep fighting 
and get even stronger.

08:52.860 --> 08:56.520
Joining up with any organization 
would only get in the way.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.100
Jinho.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.590
That's why...

09:05.350 --> 09:09.610
He... also asked me to join him.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.990
And you realize how selfish that would be?

09:16.700 --> 09:20.460
I had every intention of letting 
Jinsung run this operation.

09:20.820 --> 09:25.870
You then came in, 
and despite everything you said,

09:25.870 --> 09:27.900
instead of actually accomplishing anything,

09:27.900 --> 09:30.590
you intend on forsaking your 
responsibilities to work elsewhere?

09:31.620 --> 09:33.340
You can't be serious.

09:41.060 --> 09:42.800
Dad, I'm sorry.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.160
But I'm still going to work with Mr. Sung.

09:52.570 --> 09:56.700
Then you had best be prepared 
for the consequences.

09:59.570 --> 10:01.020
Back away, please!

10:01.460 --> 10:03.660
Please keep a reasonable distance!

10:04.060 --> 10:06.250
Don't push! It's dangerous!

10:04.990 --> 10:07.170
Don't wear yourself out dealing with them.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.090
We'll give you a lift home.

10:10.090 --> 10:11.130
It's okay.

10:17.890 --> 10:22.800
He's so physically gifted, 
despite being a mage-type hunter...

10:23.350 --> 10:24.620
President Baek?

10:25.550 --> 10:28.230
<i>So fast! Faster than I could see!</i>

10:28.820 --> 10:31.530
<i>He's gotten even stronger since then.</i>

10:32.060 --> 10:33.690
<i>How is that possible?!</i>

10:35.600 --> 10:37.430
<i>It's time to gear up.</i>

10:39.940 --> 10:42.480
We've been waiting for you, Hunter Sung.

10:42.950 --> 10:46.650
You're looking for artifacts capable 
of defending against flame, yes?

10:46.650 --> 10:49.380
May I inquire the specifics?

10:49.380 --> 10:52.310
I'm looking for protection 
from a dungeon that's pretty hot.

10:52.310 --> 10:55.330
I see! In that case...

10:55.330 --> 10:57.820
These may be what you're looking for.

10:57.820 --> 11:02.510
A cape that you can wear on top of your 
clothes, and a ring that's easy to equip.

11:02.510 --> 11:03.900
Perfect!

11:04.650 --> 11:07.020
And at these prices, 
they should be well within your budget.

11:08.510 --> 11:10.980
I don't suppose... I can get a discount?

11:12.870 --> 11:18.350
I'm ever so sorry, sir, but the listed 
prices are the only ones we offer.

11:18.350 --> 11:25.160
That said, if you can shatter this glass, 
then you can have them free of charge.

11:25.960 --> 11:31.060
We happen to use glass 
that is magically enhanced, you see.

11:31.060 --> 11:35.230
<i>This glass? I can sense magic power, 
but not that much...</i>

11:31.060 --> 11:35.670
Constructed as to not even budge 
under blows from an A-Rank hunter.

11:35.670 --> 11:41.140
Across all the globe, you won't find 
a display case of comparable security!

11:41.140 --> 11:44.930
Wait, please! It was only a joke, I'm afraid.

11:44.930 --> 11:49.420
Any unusual vibrations will summon security, 
even if the glass isn't fully broken.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.090
Oh! I didn't realize. Sorry.

11:52.090 --> 11:55.230
No, I should be the one to apologize. 
It was in most poor taste.

11:55.680 --> 12:00.720
Well.. uh... I was looking for some 
other stuff, too. Like daggers.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.370
I'm in charge of weapons, so please allow me.

12:04.370 --> 12:05.870
Right this way.

12:10.170 --> 12:13.120
But he hadn't even touched it...

12:14.030 --> 12:15.730
How much for this one?

12:15.730 --> 12:19.340
For that item, if you'll look here...

12:19.340 --> 12:21.350
<i>This little thing?</i>

12:21.350 --> 12:23.900
<i>It's only about as strong 
as Kasaka's Venom Fang.</i>

12:25.670 --> 12:27.070
In that case...

12:27.610 --> 12:28.890
Sir?

12:28.890 --> 12:30.850
Where'd I put it...?

12:31.210 --> 12:33.450
How much could I get for this?

12:33.450 --> 12:35.360
Oh, this is impressive.

12:35.730 --> 12:38.920
I can sense an attention to detail 
from the craftsman.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.030
<i>It was just an item on sale in the store...</i>

12:42.030 --> 12:45.320
I believe it would sell for 
no less than a hundred million.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.430
A hundred mill—?!

12:46.810 --> 12:49.670
<i>But it only cost 2.8 million gold.</i>

12:50.960 --> 12:53.920
<i>If the store's items can be 
sold at these prices...</i>

12:54.170 --> 12:57.270
<i>I might not even need to sell 
the Sphere of Avarice.</i>

12:58.510 --> 13:00.570
Could I use your bathroom?

13:00.570 --> 13:01.950
Oh, sure.

13:04.980 --> 13:07.810
<i>I knew he was strong.</i>

13:07.810 --> 13:10.770
<i>But what I saw... goes far beyond that.</i>

13:11.480 --> 13:14.080
<i>The magic power I could sense 
from the assessment lab,</i>

13:14.080 --> 13:16.110
<i>and the athleticism he showed...</i>

13:16.770 --> 13:19.310
<i>His reawakening should be long since past.</i>

13:19.310 --> 13:23.820
<i>And yet he's even stronger since then. 
Is that even possible?</i>

13:25.580 --> 13:28.480
<i>What if he's not a reawakened hunter...</i>

13:28.480 --> 13:32.650
<i>but one capable of getting stronger over time?</i>

13:40.020 --> 13:45.280
They're finally gone. Now I can head 
to school without worrying...

13:45.280 --> 13:46.300
You mean the press?

13:46.790 --> 13:48.560
The Association must've chased them off.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.610
Uh, if you were gonna be on TV, 
could you at least tell me,

13:51.610 --> 13:53.840
instead of making a huge scene 
out of nowhere?!

13:52.910 --> 13:54.900
Whoa, it wasn't <i>my</i> idea.

13:55.630 --> 13:56.980
Oh, by the way...

13:56.980 --> 13:59.780
I'm gonna be out of the house 
for about a week, starting tomorrow.

13:59.780 --> 14:02.350
Again? What now?

14:04.320 --> 14:05.870
Could you people give it a—

14:06.830 --> 14:10.620
Yoo Jinho, your trusty sidekick, has arrived!

14:10.620 --> 14:12.920
Huh. Is this a friend of yours?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.030
You must be his sister!

14:15.030 --> 14:18.110
I'm your brother's trusted assistant, Yoo Jinho!

14:20.510 --> 14:23.940
Starting tomorrow, we're gonna 
be on a job for a week.

14:23.940 --> 14:26.230
Tomorrow? What are you—

14:26.230 --> 14:27.510
We're gonna be on a job.

14:27.870 --> 14:29.010
Aren't we?

14:29.590 --> 14:33.440
Y-Yep! Tomorrow's job is a big deal! 
Painfully so...

14:42.360 --> 14:45.780
<i>They might be gone for now, 
but given all the media coverage...</i>

14:46.240 --> 14:47.320
Come out.

14:49.750 --> 14:53.060
Huh? I thought Tusk had four bodyguards.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.370
Where's the other one?

14:56.880 --> 15:00.800
Right, I didn't get to extract his shadow 
because he was smashed into the ceiling.

15:01.520 --> 15:05.030
Well, whatever. Strong as you are, 
three of you should be plenty.

15:06.140 --> 15:09.490
You're in charge. 
I need you to protect Jinah.

15:12.130 --> 15:13.490
Look after my sister for me.

15:15.430 --> 15:18.150
I should take a few more 
precautions while I'm at it.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.050
Start your patrol.

15:25.820 --> 15:29.600
Might end up making the city 
a little safer, come to think of it.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.780
Thanks for letting me stay the night.

15:40.420 --> 15:43.850
I don't mind, but what are you 
gonna do going forward?

15:43.850 --> 15:46.040
He didn't say you had to move out.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.640
It's my way of owning up to the consequences.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.100
What's this job at the DS Tower, though?

15:52.380 --> 15:55.630
You mentioned yesterday that you 
wouldn't be coming home for a week.

15:55.630 --> 15:58.190
Well... Let's call it training.

15:58.190 --> 16:02.340
You wanna get even <i>stronger</i>?! 
After earning an S-Rank?

16:02.810 --> 16:03.870
I guess I do.

16:08.190 --> 16:10.570
Thanks. I'm heading out.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.660
Sure! Come back safe.

16:13.030 --> 16:16.580
A ring enchanted with water, 
and a cape with wind...

16:16.980 --> 16:18.790
That'll help me beat the heat.

16:19.510 --> 16:22.830
It's time I finished off the Demon's Castle.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.760
Quest info?

16:26.490 --> 16:29.660
"Collect Demon Souls 2."

16:29.660 --> 16:33.300
I need to defeat the Demon Monarch, 
Baran, and collect his soul.

16:33.300 --> 16:36.150
Rewards... A rune stone for Shadow Exchange.

16:36.150 --> 16:38.230
That sounds like a job-exclusive skill!

16:38.230 --> 16:42.060
That's a better reward than last time. 
A nice bit of extra motivation.

16:42.730 --> 16:46.780
Let's head to the 75th floor, where I left off.

16:50.780 --> 16:53.950
I never would've thought Jinho 
would take off on his own.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.030
Do you miss him?

16:56.030 --> 16:59.540
A troublesome child has 
left the nest, that's all.

16:59.540 --> 17:02.000
Honestly, I'm surprised he 
stuck around as long as—

17:02.630 --> 17:04.550
That's strange...

17:04.550 --> 17:05.630
Honey?

17:06.080 --> 17:07.600
It's all dark...

17:07.600 --> 17:09.050
Honey?!

17:09.540 --> 17:11.030
Honey!

17:28.160 --> 17:30.060
Time for a test drive.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.030
Come on out, Tusk.

18:22.460 --> 18:26.040
He blew it away?! 
And that's after being nerfed?

18:26.470 --> 18:29.520
Might have to think carefully 
about how to use that move.

18:30.030 --> 18:33.440
For now, I'll have Tusk hold on 
to the Sphere of Avarice.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.260
I see. Jinho came to visit, then?

18:37.620 --> 18:41.590
Yes... I told him it was exhaustion.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.060
I'm sorry about this.

18:44.860 --> 18:47.020
Then it's... Eternal Sleep Disease?

18:47.470 --> 18:53.450
Yes. After periods of sudden drowsiness, 
it leads to a persistent coma.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.740
How did I end up with such a disease?

18:57.200 --> 19:01.840
It tends to occur in people with 
naturally low resistance to magic power

19:01.840 --> 19:04.130
after prolonged exposure to it.

19:04.130 --> 19:08.300
Do you have any hunters in your personal life?

19:09.910 --> 19:11.230
Honey...

19:13.500 --> 19:15.440
My son's a hunter.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.850
We can't be certain that is the cause, but...

19:21.310 --> 19:25.020
<i>The entire world is permeated 
with magic power these days.</i>

19:25.020 --> 19:27.650
<i>And I have no resistance.</i>

19:30.730 --> 19:34.700
<i>Am I being... culled?</i>

19:35.660 --> 19:38.510
Sure is peaceful, huh?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.090
Sure is.

19:40.090 --> 19:41.910
You wanna go fishing after?

19:41.910 --> 19:45.100
Aw, come on. We're still on patrol, y'know.

19:47.570 --> 19:49.000
What... is that?

19:53.300 --> 19:56.230
<i>I formed six squads of shadows 
for efficiency's sake.</i>

19:56.230 --> 19:58.710
<i>Looks like having them split up has paid off.</i>

19:59.500 --> 20:03.220
<i>When I sent them out, 
I gave them two orders:</i>

20:03.850 --> 20:07.190
<i>Each team is to take down 
any enemies they encounter,</i>

20:07.720 --> 20:10.400
<i>and if they find an entry permit, 
they're to let me know.</i>

20:11.320 --> 20:13.630
<i>That means missing out on any other items,</i>

20:13.630 --> 20:16.090
<i>but we're making much 
faster progress in exchange.</i>

20:16.700 --> 20:18.790
Or so I thought.

20:18.790 --> 20:21.160
But it's been two days since 
we made it to the 80th floor,

20:21.160 --> 20:23.080
and the pace has slowed down a lot.

20:23.910 --> 20:25.560
Is there some reason?

20:27.430 --> 20:29.920
The shadows are being destroyed.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.750
That's the high orc squad A.

20:33.230 --> 20:36.590
I didn't think any of the greater demons 
would be a match for the high orcs.

20:37.580 --> 20:41.430
I'll recall them and go check it out.

20:45.020 --> 20:47.960
Squad B's down now, too.

20:48.350 --> 20:51.350
I don't know who did this, 
but they must be pretty fierce.

20:52.220 --> 20:57.180
Something doesn't make sense, though. 
Tusk's squad was right by squad A.

20:57.180 --> 21:00.700
So why was squad B, which was 
further away, the next to go down?

21:00.700 --> 21:03.370
Did they know they weren't 
strong enough to beat Tusk?

21:03.930 --> 21:09.390
<i>If they target foes based on strength, 
that implies a level of intelligence.</i>

21:09.390 --> 21:13.280
<i>And if that's the case, 
the next target is likely...</i>

21:28.100 --> 21:29.560
<i>Makes sense.</i>

21:31.600 --> 21:34.980
<i>No wonder the magic beast soldiers 
couldn't handle them.</i>

21:51.500 --> 21:53.620
I've been curious for a while now.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.300
Do magic beasts feel fear?

22:01.260 --> 22:04.570
Guess I have my answer.
WEBVTT

00:10.700 --> 00:13.960
Whoa, look over there! That's Baek 
Yoonho from the White Tiger Guild!

00:13.960 --> 00:16.520
Choi Jong-in from the Hunters Guild, too!

00:17.300 --> 00:19.370
Look at all the press.

00:19.370 --> 00:21.630
What are they even here for?

00:21.630 --> 00:24.950
Are the two of you here 
to recruit Lee Minsung?

00:24.950 --> 00:26.880
<i>Minsung? Who are they talking about?</i>

00:24.950 --> 00:27.570
What's the likelihood that 
he'll be retiring from acting?

00:27.570 --> 00:30.300
I'm not here for him.

00:27.570 --> 00:30.300
Do you have any comment on his assessment?

00:30.300 --> 00:34.670
I understand that Mr. Minsung has contracted 
with the Reaper Guild already,

00:34.670 --> 00:36.520
so this is a separate matter.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.810
Damn...

00:37.810 --> 00:39.680
It would've spiced the story up.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.910
What a waste of time.

00:41.910 --> 00:43.560
I've heard the news.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.500
That A-Rank gate that nearly hit the 
S-Rank threshold was real trouble, huh?

00:47.500 --> 00:53.570
Nothing as serious as the red gate that 
cost the White Tigers a rookie A-Rank.

00:53.570 --> 00:57.190
I heard you were on the verge 
of giving us a call, though.

00:57.190 --> 01:00.400
He's the reason why that wasn't necessary.

01:00.400 --> 01:05.470
The Hunters Guild is prepared to give him 
a very warm welcome as a show of gratitude.

01:05.470 --> 01:10.710
Don't be ridiculous! He saved our people, 
too! And after a casualty, at that!

01:13.610 --> 01:18.190
Do you really need more S-Ranks? 
Are you looking to start a war?

01:18.190 --> 01:21.890
I could say the same thing to you!

01:23.780 --> 01:26.820
Hey, if it isn't Jong-in and Yoonho.

01:26.820 --> 01:31.590
You boys aren't here to try and 
snatch Minsung from us, are you?

01:31.590 --> 01:35.200
Like I said, I don't give a damn 
about Minsung or Min-<i>anyone</i>!

01:31.590 --> 01:35.200
I already said, I don't care 
about Minsung or Min-<i>anyone</i>!

01:35.620 --> 01:38.610
Damn, you guys are in sync.

01:39.210 --> 01:41.460
Uh, I'm here for my reassessment.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.270
What's going on?

03:14.640 --> 03:17.050
Check it out! It's Minsung's press conference!

03:17.350 --> 03:18.670
The actor?

03:18.670 --> 03:21.210
He's supposed to be a total playboy.

03:21.210 --> 03:23.220
They call him the co-star killer.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.220
What are they talking about?

03:23.220 --> 03:25.020
Is he giving a public apology?

03:23.220 --> 03:25.020
Don't care.

03:25.460 --> 03:28.600
I'd like to thank you all for gathering today.

03:28.930 --> 03:34.370
As you're all aware, I, Lee Minsung, 
have awakened as a hunter.

03:34.370 --> 03:36.820
I'll be getting my rank assessed today.

03:37.150 --> 03:40.380
Since the day I awakened, 
I've struggled with this decision.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.300
But now I've made up my mind!

03:42.300 --> 03:44.750
To fulfill the destiny 
that I've been born with!

03:45.370 --> 03:51.130
I'll be fighting for Mr. Lim Tae-gyu, 
the guild master of the Reaper Guild!

03:51.130 --> 03:54.260
Are your acting days over?

03:54.260 --> 03:56.190
Isn't this jumping the gun 
before your assessment?

03:56.190 --> 03:58.030
Will you be focusing on your hunter duties?

03:58.760 --> 04:03.430
<i>How gullible can they get? 
I've got my A-Rank already.</i>

04:03.430 --> 04:06.890
<i>My contract with the Reapers is for two years.</i>

04:06.890 --> 04:09.950
<i>I'll dabble in hunting for that time,</i>

04:09.950 --> 04:11.700
<i>people will forget all about my scandals,</i>

04:11.700 --> 04:16.480
<i>and after? I'll be an A-Rank hunter who acts.</i>

04:16.480 --> 04:20.720
No matter what rank I receive, I'm prepared 
to fight as a hunter with my life on the—

04:20.720 --> 04:22.330
What do you think you're doing?!

04:22.330 --> 04:24.220
Can't you see all these reporters?

04:24.220 --> 04:25.990
You're in the way! Buzz off!

04:25.990 --> 04:28.460
Uh, I have business with the Association.

04:28.460 --> 04:29.700
It can wait!

04:29.700 --> 04:32.080
<i>Who is this oblivious idiot?</i>

04:32.420 --> 04:35.250
This entrance is closed! 
Now get out of here—

04:35.250 --> 04:38.360
I'm afraid that isn't your call to make.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.960
Ch-Chairman Go!

04:41.420 --> 04:44.260
This young man is a guest of mine.

04:44.890 --> 04:49.320
I seem to recall asking you to refrain from 
holding a press conference at this hour.

04:49.320 --> 04:53.110
But... I'm trying to distract from my...

04:50.270 --> 04:53.110
Right this way, Hunter Sung.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.570
<i>What the hell do I do now?</i>

04:59.090 --> 05:02.530
I'll be right back! I just need to 
confirm with the Association!

05:05.120 --> 05:08.640
There's someone else being 
reassessed at the moment.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.170
I'm afraid you can't enter 
until it's complete.

05:12.180 --> 05:14.950
Dude, do you know who I am?

05:14.950 --> 05:17.110
One word from me, 
and you'll be out on your—

05:17.110 --> 05:19.920
I can't say I recognize you,

05:19.920 --> 05:25.010
but I don't appreciate 
your lack of consideration.

05:29.710 --> 05:33.850
After hearing about today, 
they came to await your results.

05:34.360 --> 05:39.590
I'm sure they're interested in the first 
S-Rank hunter to appear in two years.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.310
Before we begin the reassessment,

05:46.310 --> 05:49.630
I'd like to confirm the nature 
of your hunter abilities.

05:49.630 --> 05:52.500
What kind of powers do 
you have, Hunter Sung?

05:52.500 --> 05:54.670
I can produce these.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.980
I... assume this is a summon?

06:00.980 --> 06:03.800
Then you have summoning magic.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.240
That... sounds right, sure.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.010
Hunter Sung.

06:08.010 --> 06:11.190
I've received a detailed account of 
your abilities from Manager Woo.

06:11.190 --> 06:13.980
You're not going to hold out on us, are you?

06:14.230 --> 06:17.560
<i>Yeah, I guess the cat's out 
of the bag at this point.</i>

06:23.740 --> 06:26.740
I can produce around a hundred more.

06:26.740 --> 06:28.630
A h-hundred?!

06:28.630 --> 06:30.290
That's unbelievable!

06:31.990 --> 06:34.080
<i>His magic power is tremendous!</i>

06:34.080 --> 06:36.290
<i>It's enough to overwhelm even me...</i>

06:37.300 --> 06:41.160
<i>This is Hunter Sung's power?!</i>

06:44.200 --> 06:48.220
Thank you for your patience. 
Your reassessment is now complete.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.990
This is your new hunter ID.

06:51.390 --> 06:55.470
<i>Perfect. Now I can sell the Sphere of Avarice 
without raising any eyebrows.</i>

06:55.470 --> 07:00.220
<i>That should cover the gear I need 
to beat the Demon's Castle!</i>

07:00.220 --> 07:05.070
You are now officially an S-Rank hunter.

07:05.460 --> 07:10.570
I'm looking forward to seeing 
what you do with that strength.

07:15.210 --> 07:18.040
Congratulations on your S-Rank assessment.

07:18.040 --> 07:22.240
Would you mind letting me thank you 
for your help the other day?

07:22.240 --> 07:24.830
I've got something I'd like 
to discuss with you, as well.

07:24.830 --> 07:27.350
If you could spare some of your time...

07:27.350 --> 07:29.910
Sorry. I've actually got something 
to attend to right now.

07:29.910 --> 07:31.100
Hang on, there's still—

07:31.450 --> 07:32.970
<i>Huh? What did he...</i>

07:37.020 --> 07:39.000
Uh, hey...

07:39.450 --> 07:41.190
Hmm?

07:41.190 --> 07:44.100
Hey. Hey, pay attention!

07:44.100 --> 07:45.390
What?

07:45.390 --> 07:48.700
That's Jinwoo—uh, your brother on the stream.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.930
Huh?

07:53.450 --> 07:55.710
No way! How?!

07:56.160 --> 08:00.430
<i>We've only just been able 
to confirm this information.</i>

07:57.160 --> 07:59.350
He really did make the news.

07:59.350 --> 08:04.170
I tried to tell you! He's got a killer's eyes!

08:00.430 --> 08:04.170
<i>It's been one hour since Chairman Go appeared,</i>

08:04.170 --> 08:06.630
No telling what kind of 
messed-up stuff he's done!

08:04.170 --> 08:06.630
<i>accompanying him to his reassessment...</i>

08:06.630 --> 08:10.550
<i>and now Hunter Sung has been 
officially named as S-Rank.</i>

08:10.550 --> 08:12.940
<i>The Association's database has been updated,</i>

08:12.940 --> 08:17.300
<i>and while there has been no announcement, 
it seems his S-Rank status is confirmed.</i>

08:17.300 --> 08:18.690
<i>He is now</i>

08:18.690 --> 08:20.850
<i>the 10th S-Rank hunter in the country—</i>

08:20.850 --> 08:24.820
<i>the first to emerge in the 
two years since Hunter Cha.</i>

08:27.900 --> 08:28.860
An S-Rank?!

08:28.860 --> 08:30.230
W-Wait—

08:28.860 --> 08:30.240
He's the tenth S-Rank!

08:30.240 --> 08:31.690
Hurry! Get after him!

08:30.240 --> 08:32.590
But... my press conference...

08:32.590 --> 08:33.700
Don't let him get away!

08:35.240 --> 08:38.730
I wasn't able to get Mr. Sung 
to accept the offer.

08:38.730 --> 08:39.750
I see.

08:41.930 --> 08:42.960
<i>Sorry.</i>

08:43.410 --> 08:46.970
There's still something I need 
to take care of on my own.

08:47.740 --> 08:52.210
And to do that, I need to keep fighting 
and get even stronger.

08:52.860 --> 08:56.520
Joining up with any organization 
would only get in the way.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.100
Jinho.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.590
That's why...

09:05.350 --> 09:09.610
He... also asked me to join him.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.990
And you realize how selfish that would be?

09:16.700 --> 09:20.460
I had every intention of letting 
Jinsung run this operation.

09:20.820 --> 09:25.870
You then came in, 
and despite everything you said,

09:25.870 --> 09:27.900
instead of actually accomplishing anything,

09:27.900 --> 09:30.590
you intend on forsaking your 
responsibilities to work elsewhere?

09:31.620 --> 09:33.340
You can't be serious.

09:41.060 --> 09:42.800
Dad, I'm sorry.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.160
But I'm still going to work with Mr. Sung.

09:52.570 --> 09:56.700
Then you had best be prepared 
for the consequences.

09:59.570 --> 10:01.020
Back away, please!

10:01.460 --> 10:03.660
Please keep a reasonable distance!

10:04.060 --> 10:06.250
Don't push! It's dangerous!

10:04.990 --> 10:07.170
Don't wear yourself out dealing with them.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.090
We'll give you a lift home.

10:10.090 --> 10:11.130
It's okay.

10:17.890 --> 10:22.800
He's so physically gifted, 
despite being a mage-type hunter...

10:23.350 --> 10:24.620
President Baek?

10:25.550 --> 10:28.230
<i>So fast! Faster than I could see!</i>

10:28.820 --> 10:31.530
<i>He's gotten even stronger since then.</i>

10:32.060 --> 10:33.690
<i>How is that possible?!</i>

10:35.600 --> 10:37.430
<i>It's time to gear up.</i>

10:39.940 --> 10:42.480
We've been waiting for you, Hunter Sung.

10:42.950 --> 10:46.650
You're looking for artifacts capable 
of defending against flame, yes?

10:46.650 --> 10:49.380
May I inquire the specifics?

10:49.380 --> 10:52.310
I'm looking for protection 
from a dungeon that's pretty hot.

10:52.310 --> 10:55.330
I see! In that case...

10:55.330 --> 10:57.820
These may be what you're looking for.

10:57.820 --> 11:02.510
A cape that you can wear on top of your 
clothes, and a ring that's easy to equip.

11:02.510 --> 11:03.900
Perfect!

11:04.650 --> 11:07.020
And at these prices, 
they should be well within your budget.

11:08.510 --> 11:10.980
I don't suppose... I can get a discount?

11:12.870 --> 11:18.350
I'm ever so sorry, sir, but the listed 
prices are the only ones we offer.

11:18.350 --> 11:25.160
That said, if you can shatter this glass, 
then you can have them free of charge.

11:25.960 --> 11:31.060
We happen to use glass 
that is magically enhanced, you see.

11:31.060 --> 11:35.230
<i>This glass? I can sense magic power, 
but not that much...</i>

11:31.060 --> 11:35.670
Constructed as to not even budge 
under blows from an A-Rank hunter.

11:35.670 --> 11:41.140
Across all the globe, you won't find 
a display case of comparable security!

11:41.140 --> 11:44.930
Wait, please! It was only a joke, I'm afraid.

11:44.930 --> 11:49.420
Any unusual vibrations will summon security, 
even if the glass isn't fully broken.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.090
Oh! I didn't realize. Sorry.

11:52.090 --> 11:55.230
No, I should be the one to apologize. 
It was in most poor taste.

11:55.680 --> 12:00.720
Well.. uh... I was looking for some 
other stuff, too. Like daggers.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.370
I'm in charge of weapons, so please allow me.

12:04.370 --> 12:05.870
Right this way.

12:10.170 --> 12:13.120
But he hadn't even touched it...

12:14.030 --> 12:15.730
How much for this one?

12:15.730 --> 12:19.340
For that item, if you'll look here...

12:19.340 --> 12:21.350
<i>This little thing?</i>

12:21.350 --> 12:23.900
<i>It's only about as strong 
as Kasaka's Venom Fang.</i>

12:25.670 --> 12:27.070
In that case...

12:27.610 --> 12:28.890
Sir?

12:28.890 --> 12:30.850
Where'd I put it...?

12:31.210 --> 12:33.450
How much could I get for this?

12:33.450 --> 12:35.360
Oh, this is impressive.

12:35.730 --> 12:38.920
I can sense an attention to detail 
from the craftsman.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.030
<i>It was just an item on sale in the store...</i>

12:42.030 --> 12:45.320
I believe it would sell for 
no less than a hundred million.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.430
A hundred mill—?!

12:46.810 --> 12:49.670
<i>But it only cost 2.8 million gold.</i>

12:50.960 --> 12:53.920
<i>If the store's items can be 
sold at these prices...</i>

12:54.170 --> 12:57.270
<i>I might not even need to sell 
the Sphere of Avarice.</i>

12:58.510 --> 13:00.570
Could I use your bathroom?

13:00.570 --> 13:01.950
Oh, sure.

13:04.980 --> 13:07.810
<i>I knew he was strong.</i>

13:07.810 --> 13:10.770
<i>But what I saw... goes far beyond that.</i>

13:11.480 --> 13:14.080
<i>The magic power I could sense 
from the assessment lab,</i>

13:14.080 --> 13:16.110
<i>and the athleticism he showed...</i>

13:16.770 --> 13:19.310
<i>His reawakening should be long since past.</i>

13:19.310 --> 13:23.820
<i>And yet he's even stronger since then. 
Is that even possible?</i>

13:25.580 --> 13:28.480
<i>What if he's not a reawakened hunter...</i>

13:28.480 --> 13:32.650
<i>but one capable of getting stronger over time?</i>

13:40.020 --> 13:45.280
They're finally gone. Now I can head 
to school without worrying...

13:45.280 --> 13:46.300
You mean the press?

13:46.790 --> 13:48.560
The Association must've chased them off.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.610
Uh, if you were gonna be on TV, 
could you at least tell me,

13:51.610 --> 13:53.840
instead of making a huge scene 
out of nowhere?!

13:52.910 --> 13:54.900
Whoa, it wasn't <i>my</i> idea.

13:55.630 --> 13:56.980
Oh, by the way...

13:56.980 --> 13:59.780
I'm gonna be out of the house 
for about a week, starting tomorrow.

13:59.780 --> 14:02.350
Again? What now?

14:04.320 --> 14:05.870
Could you people give it a—

14:06.830 --> 14:10.620
Yoo Jinho, your trusty sidekick, has arrived!

14:10.620 --> 14:12.920
Huh. Is this a friend of yours?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.030
You must be his sister!

14:15.030 --> 14:18.110
I'm your brother's trusted assistant, Yoo Jinho!

14:20.510 --> 14:23.940
Starting tomorrow, we're gonna 
be on a job for a week.

14:23.940 --> 14:26.230
Tomorrow? What are you—

14:26.230 --> 14:27.510
We're gonna be on a job.

14:27.870 --> 14:29.010
Aren't we?

14:29.590 --> 14:33.440
Y-Yep! Tomorrow's job is a big deal! 
Painfully so...

14:42.360 --> 14:45.780
<i>They might be gone for now, 
but given all the media coverage...</i>

14:46.240 --> 14:47.320
Come out.

14:49.750 --> 14:53.060
Huh? I thought Tusk had four bodyguards.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.370
Where's the other one?

14:56.880 --> 15:00.800
Right, I didn't get to extract his shadow 
because he was smashed into the ceiling.

15:01.520 --> 15:05.030
Well, whatever. Strong as you are, 
three of you should be plenty.

15:06.140 --> 15:09.490
You're in charge. 
I need you to protect Jinah.

15:12.130 --> 15:13.490
Look after my sister for me.

15:15.430 --> 15:18.150
I should take a few more 
precautions while I'm at it.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.050
Start your patrol.

15:25.820 --> 15:29.600
Might end up making the city 
a little safer, come to think of it.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.780
Thanks for letting me stay the night.

15:40.420 --> 15:43.850
I don't mind, but what are you 
gonna do going forward?

15:43.850 --> 15:46.040
He didn't say you had to move out.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.640
It's my way of owning up to the consequences.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.100
What's this job at the DS Tower, though?

15:52.380 --> 15:55.630
You mentioned yesterday that you 
wouldn't be coming home for a week.

15:55.630 --> 15:58.190
Well... Let's call it training.

15:58.190 --> 16:02.340
You wanna get even <i>stronger</i>?! 
After earning an S-Rank?

16:02.810 --> 16:03.870
I guess I do.

16:08.190 --> 16:10.570
Thanks. I'm heading out.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.660
Sure! Come back safe.

16:13.030 --> 16:16.580
A ring enchanted with water, 
and a cape with wind...

16:16.980 --> 16:18.790
That'll help me beat the heat.

16:19.510 --> 16:22.830
It's time I finished off the Demon's Castle.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.760
Quest info?

16:26.490 --> 16:29.660
"Collect Demon Souls 2."

16:29.660 --> 16:33.300
I need to defeat the Demon Monarch, 
Baran, and collect his soul.

16:33.300 --> 16:36.150
Rewards... A rune stone for Shadow Exchange.

16:36.150 --> 16:38.230
That sounds like a job-exclusive skill!

16:38.230 --> 16:42.060
That's a better reward than last time. 
A nice bit of extra motivation.

16:42.730 --> 16:46.780
Let's head to the 75th floor, where I left off.

16:50.780 --> 16:53.950
I never would've thought Jinho 
would take off on his own.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.030
Do you miss him?

16:56.030 --> 16:59.540
A troublesome child has 
left the nest, that's all.

16:59.540 --> 17:02.000
Honestly, I'm surprised he 
stuck around as long as—

17:02.630 --> 17:04.550
That's strange...

17:04.550 --> 17:05.630
Honey?

17:06.080 --> 17:07.600
It's all dark...

17:07.600 --> 17:09.050
Honey?!

17:09.540 --> 17:11.030
Honey!

17:28.160 --> 17:30.060
Time for a test drive.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.030
Come on out, Tusk.

18:22.460 --> 18:26.040
He blew it away?! 
And that's after being nerfed?

18:26.470 --> 18:29.520
Might have to think carefully 
about how to use that move.

18:30.030 --> 18:33.440
For now, I'll have Tusk hold on 
to the Sphere of Avarice.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.260
I see. Jinho came to visit, then?

18:37.620 --> 18:41.590
Yes... I told him it was exhaustion.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.060
I'm sorry about this.

18:44.860 --> 18:47.020
Then it's... Eternal Sleep Disease?

18:47.470 --> 18:53.450
Yes. After periods of sudden drowsiness, 
it leads to a persistent coma.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.740
How did I end up with such a disease?

18:57.200 --> 19:01.840
It tends to occur in people with 
naturally low resistance to magic power

19:01.840 --> 19:04.130
after prolonged exposure to it.

19:04.130 --> 19:08.300
Do you have any hunters in your personal life?

19:09.910 --> 19:11.230
Honey...

19:13.500 --> 19:15.440
My son's a hunter.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.850
We can't be certain that is the cause, but...

19:21.310 --> 19:25.020
<i>The entire world is permeated 
with magic power these days.</i>

19:25.020 --> 19:27.650
<i>And I have no resistance.</i>

19:30.730 --> 19:34.700
<i>Am I being... culled?</i>

19:35.660 --> 19:38.510
Sure is peaceful, huh?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.090
Sure is.

19:40.090 --> 19:41.910
You wanna go fishing after?

19:41.910 --> 19:45.100
Aw, come on. We're still on patrol, y'know.

19:47.570 --> 19:49.000
What... is that?

19:53.300 --> 19:56.230
<i>I formed six squads of shadows 
for efficiency's sake.</i>

19:56.230 --> 19:58.710
<i>Looks like having them split up has paid off.</i>

19:59.500 --> 20:03.220
<i>When I sent them out, 
I gave them two orders:</i>

20:03.850 --> 20:07.190
<i>Each team is to take down 
any enemies they encounter,</i>

20:07.720 --> 20:10.400
<i>and if they find an entry permit, 
they're to let me know.</i>

20:11.320 --> 20:13.630
<i>That means missing out on any other items,</i>

20:13.630 --> 20:16.090
<i>but we're making much 
faster progress in exchange.</i>

20:16.700 --> 20:18.790
Or so I thought.

20:18.790 --> 20:21.160
But it's been two days since 
we made it to the 80th floor,

20:21.160 --> 20:23.080
and the pace has slowed down a lot.

20:23.910 --> 20:25.560
Is there some reason?

20:27.430 --> 20:29.920
The shadows are being destroyed.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.750
That's the high orc squad A.

20:33.230 --> 20:36.590
I didn't think any of the greater demons 
would be a match for the high orcs.

20:37.580 --> 20:41.430
I'll recall them and go check it out.

20:45.020 --> 20:47.960
Squad B's down now, too.

20:48.350 --> 20:51.350
I don't know who did this, 
but they must be pretty fierce.

20:52.220 --> 20:57.180
Something doesn't make sense, though. 
Tusk's squad was right by squad A.

20:57.180 --> 21:00.700
So why was squad B, which was 
further away, the next to go down?

21:00.700 --> 21:03.370
Did they know they weren't 
strong enough to beat Tusk?

21:03.930 --> 21:09.390
<i>If they target foes based on strength, 
that implies a level of intelligence.</i>

21:09.390 --> 21:13.280
<i>And if that's the case, 
the next target is likely...</i>

21:28.100 --> 21:29.560
<i>Makes sense.</i>

21:31.600 --> 21:34.980
<i>No wonder the magic beast soldiers 
couldn't handle them.</i>

21:51.500 --> 21:53.620
I've been curious for a while now.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.300
Do magic beasts feel fear?

22:01.260 --> 22:04.570
Guess I have my answer.
