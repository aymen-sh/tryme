00:01.240 --> 00:04.330
I-It came out pretty nicely, huh?

00:04.330 --> 00:09.060
In Xeno's words, it's extremely...

00:11.170 --> 00:12.860
elegant.

00:15.790 --> 00:16.830
Luna...

00:18.610 --> 00:21.840
Was Doctor Xeno a former NASA scientist?

00:22.670 --> 00:24.230
How did you know?!

00:30.480 --> 00:32.060
Doctor Xeno...

00:32.610 --> 00:35.060
He got me started on rocket building.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.250
He's my science mentor.

02:16.050 --> 02:20.990
<b>The Two Scientists</b>

02:32.720 --> 02:33.590
All right.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.340
Here we go.

02:35.340 --> 02:36.260
Okay.

02:51.550 --> 02:53.110
What caused that?

02:54.990 --> 02:55.850
Dang it!

02:55.850 --> 02:57.860
I don't get any of it.

03:02.590 --> 03:05.890
You can look up rocket secrets 
on your computer, huh?

03:07.230 --> 03:08.950
You can read English?!

03:08.950 --> 03:10.640
You're amazing, Senku!

03:10.640 --> 03:12.460
No, not at all.

03:12.820 --> 03:14.660
Nothing beyond "This is a pen."

03:14.660 --> 03:16.500
What's a "Desuizu"?

03:16.500 --> 03:19.620
Then again, most of the articles are in English.

03:19.620 --> 03:22.220
I have to do the best I can 
with a dictionary in hand.

03:22.740 --> 03:25.730
Just scouring articles will only get you so far.

03:25.730 --> 03:28.900
You can save time sharing 
information with colleagues.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.940
That's how science works.

03:36.660 --> 03:39.510
And you're sending that all over the world, huh?

03:39.510 --> 03:41.130
That's right.

03:41.130 --> 03:43.200
I'm practically a spammer.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.890
We got a question from an 
elementary school student.

03:53.890 --> 03:57.070
"Why is the sky blue when space is black?"

03:57.070 --> 03:58.490
That's adorable.

03:58.490 --> 04:00.350
Give them a good answer.

04:00.350 --> 04:02.300
This one's from an elementary 
school student in Japan.

04:02.630 --> 04:04.800
Senku-kun, huh?

04:05.780 --> 04:08.900
He must have put in a lot of 
effort to write it in English.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.430
Let's see...

04:15.910 --> 04:19.600
<i>I started off my rocket research modding 
the hell out of a car turbocharger,</i>

04:19.600 --> 04:23.260
<i>but I'm hitting a stupid number of brick walls 
trying to decipher papers by brute force.</i>

04:23.260 --> 04:26.440
<i>The first problem was with the oscillating 
component of the firing pressure.</i>

04:26.440 --> 04:30.670
<i>I managed to get the intermediate 
frequency oscillatory combustion error</i>

04:30.670 --> 04:35.620
<i>down to 7% by running a computer simulation.</i>

04:35.620 --> 04:38.950
<i>There's no way I'm doing that on my potato 
PC, though. Not in ten billion years.</i>

04:38.950 --> 04:42.990
<i>So I set up a VPN server on a lab server 
at the university my dad taught at</i>

04:42.990 --> 04:45.720
<i>and used the supercomputer there to optimize 
the structure of the fuel injector, and...</i>

04:42.990 --> 04:45.720
I'm pretty sure he's confessing 
to some crimes here.

04:45.990 --> 04:48.560
Nah, there's no way any elementary 
school kid could be like this.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.350
It must be a prank by some grown-up.

04:50.590 --> 04:53.870
Either way, we can't get involved.

04:53.870 --> 04:54.980
Ignore him.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.670
Nice, Senku!

05:11.670 --> 05:17.170
You got a reply from someone 
who actually works at NASA!

05:15.570 --> 05:17.170
Pipe down.

05:18.390 --> 05:20.690
<i>I've included the math below,</i>

05:20.690 --> 05:24.420
<i>but long story short, the nozzle will 
need to be made of niobium alloy.</i>

05:24.950 --> 05:30.430
<i>Doctor Senku, I suspect that you 
are being led astray by noisy data.</i>

05:30.950 --> 05:33.070
<i>You must be using subpar equipment.</i>

05:33.520 --> 05:37.550
<i>You should get your hands on a 
resistance thermometer that has a</i>

05:37.550 --> 05:39.190
<i>rhodium-platinum alloy heat sensor.</i>

05:39.840 --> 05:42.190
<i>From Dr. X of NASA.</i>

05:45.420 --> 05:47.460
Here you go, Senku.

05:47.460 --> 05:48.640
Thanks.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.090
So you need to buy this 
thermometer in the photo, huh?

05:53.090 --> 05:54.450
Think they have it at the 100-yen store?

05:54.820 --> 05:56.570
How much does this thing even cost?

06:00.600 --> 06:02.000
platinum

06:02.500 --> 06:03.940
<b>Platinum-rhodium Alloy Thermometer Sensor</b>

06:02.500 --> 06:03.940

06:13.140 --> 06:15.060

06:15.350 --> 06:18.770
I can't believe you came all 
the way to the US for me!

06:18.770 --> 06:21.510
You missed me that much, huh?

06:18.770 --> 06:22.400
Yeah, skip the pleasantries 
and just give me the thing.

06:23.010 --> 06:24.820
The magic card.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.240
S-Sure...

06:27.320 --> 06:34.370
The demon's credit card that lets you 
buy anything science-related for free

06:34.370 --> 06:36.800
when an astronaut enters training in the US!

06:36.800 --> 06:38.930
How do you know about that?

06:38.930 --> 06:42.330
I mean, it's a real thing, but Google 
won't even tell you much about it.

06:43.780 --> 06:45.460
You're going home already?!

06:45.460 --> 06:49.780
What are you, one of those people who lost 
on the plane in All-American Ultra Quiz?!

06:49.780 --> 06:51.600
Generation gap, old fart.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.180
I don't get your reference.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.100
When are you coming to the US for real?!

06:55.100 --> 06:57.430
When the credit card expires 
and I need to renew it.

06:57.430 --> 07:00.350
Aren't you being a bit too cold to your old man?!

07:00.350 --> 07:02.860
<b>Platinum-Rhodium Alloy Resistance Thermometer</b>

07:02.860 --> 07:04.980

<b>Phase-Contrast Microscope</b>

07:07.110 --> 07:09.740

07:10.930 --> 07:12.770
So much expensive-looking gear!

07:12.770 --> 07:14.690
Not that I know what any of it is.

07:14.690 --> 07:17.910
I could make do without it, but hey.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.790
I'll gladly take anything I can get.

07:21.790 --> 07:28.240
With this mountain of equipment 
and Doctor X's online classes...

07:30.330 --> 07:31.980
I'm going to investigate everything.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.800
I'm going to try everything.

07:34.990 --> 07:37.540
We'll make our way up two 
million years of human history

07:38.050 --> 07:42.590
not from the ground up, but from 
atop the shoulders of giants.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.220
Man, Senku...

08:53.530 --> 08:56.330
I thought you were trying 
to build a rocket, though.

08:56.330 --> 09:00.350
Why do you ask him stuff that has 
nothing to do with that project?

09:02.230 --> 09:06.230
If only we knew which science 
would be useful for what.

09:06.690 --> 09:10.980
That's like asking why I don't just 
bet on all the winning horses.

09:10.980 --> 09:13.650
There's so much we don't know.

09:13.650 --> 09:15.030
Science is...

09:15.170 --> 09:16.030
New message received.

09:19.010 --> 09:22.020
<i>Science is power.</i>

09:24.370 --> 09:28.360
<i>For example, you don't need me 
to tell you that your rocket</i>

09:28.360 --> 09:31.920
<i>and a ballistic missile are 
fundamentally one and the same.</i>

09:32.660 --> 09:34.230
<i>With science,</i>

09:34.230 --> 09:39.650
<i>an intelligent person can guide the foolish 
masses toward truth and rule over them.</i>

09:40.670 --> 09:45.020
<i>It's an elegant power indeed, Doctor Senku.</i>

09:45.710 --> 09:49.810
Yeah, I'm not interested in that crap.

09:50.090 --> 09:56.080
I'm just stupidly curious about the secrets 
of the world and the universe.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.360
All of it.

09:58.700 --> 09:59.900
All of it!

10:01.920 --> 10:04.400
Ten billion percent all of it!

10:29.580 --> 10:30.820
Hey, Xeno...

10:30.820 --> 10:33.820
What would you do if you were 
transported back to the Stone Age?

10:37.940 --> 10:42.640
I'd be able to make weapons of science from 
scratch and become a dictator, wouldn't I?

10:43.900 --> 10:46.500
Would you even want to become a dictator?

10:48.540 --> 10:50.850
What if there are other scientists?

10:51.390 --> 10:52.630
Exactly.

10:53.150 --> 10:57.900
No matter the situation, 
humanity, ten billion percent,

10:57.900 --> 11:04.760
always produces a greedy bastard who 
wants to know everything about the world.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.900
Someone like my son.

11:10.510 --> 11:14.790
Then I'd be facing off 
against this man or woman.

11:15.160 --> 11:19.540
Who will master science in the 
primitive stone world first?

11:21.790 --> 11:27.250
<i>Doing so, you can keep the temperature 
in the chamber under 60 degrees Celsius.</i>

11:27.250 --> 11:34.420
<i>In other words, your homemade rocket could be 
packed with biological and chemical weapons.</i>

11:34.980 --> 11:39.570
I gotta know everything, 
whether I care for it or not.

11:42.220 --> 11:46.350
<i>So sulfanomides would work 
against pneumococcus, then.</i>

11:48.510 --> 11:49.950
Where are you headed, Senku?

11:49.950 --> 11:50.910
Africa.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.190
What?!

12:04.960 --> 12:06.740
My son's coming!

12:07.650 --> 12:09.400
You two are real close, huh?

12:09.400 --> 12:10.260
<i>Nah...</i>

12:10.260 --> 12:13.920
<i>He's coming for the awful reason 
that my credit card expired.</i>

12:14.700 --> 12:16.640
We're meeting up outside.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.500
His name's Senku.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.900
Senku...

13:01.910 --> 13:03.880
Hey!

13:03.880 --> 13:06.770
Senku!

13:08.330 --> 13:09.810
What is it?

13:11.060 --> 13:12.220
Nothing.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.640
<b>Petrified swallows?!</b>

13:56.060 --> 13:57.810
Swallow 
populations

13:56.060 --> 13:57.810
Social media posts

13:56.060 --> 13:57.810
Europe
South America
Japan

14:01.630 --> 14:04.160
The geographical correlation 
between social media posts

14:04.160 --> 14:07.690
and swallow populations is 
too strong to be coincidence.

14:07.690 --> 14:10.910
It's safe to assume these are real 
swallows being turned to stone.

14:11.220 --> 14:13.210
That's an interesting approach.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.630
An old fogy like me can 
hardly use a smartphone,

14:15.630 --> 14:17.410
let alone come up with such an analysis.

14:17.410 --> 14:19.790
This kind of science is a young person's game.

14:20.010 --> 14:21.530
It wasn't me.

14:21.530 --> 14:25.090
It was a high school student 
who posted that analysis data.

14:27.750 --> 14:29.040
One from Japan.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.770
CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

14:41.900 --> 14:44.380
It even has internal organs.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.280
No one could make such a sculpture.

14:46.680 --> 14:53.220
There's a notable difference in hydrophobicity 
between the center and the peripheries.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.410
The finer areas repel water more.

14:55.700 --> 14:57.930
What about the X-ray fluorescence analysis?

14:57.930 --> 15:02.130
Mostly iron. Traces of gold, 
as well as carbon and nitrogen.

15:02.570 --> 15:05.420
Yet it hardly reacts to any chemicals.

15:05.420 --> 15:08.170
Only a slight ion outflow 
in response to nitric acid.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.770
What about UV radiation?

15:09.770 --> 15:12.670
No embrittlement in response to 
short wavelength electromagnetism.

15:12.670 --> 15:13.750
Impossible!

15:14.080 --> 15:16.450
It reacts in unrecognizable 
ways to each frequency.

15:16.450 --> 15:18.670
We have no way to determine its structure.

15:18.670 --> 15:20.990
I've never seen such a mineral.

15:20.990 --> 15:23.990
Really, I'm not even sure 
"mineral" is the right word.

15:25.480 --> 15:29.820
<i>This is a global-scale—no, 
universe-scale anomaly.</i>

15:30.270 --> 15:33.940
<i>Doctor Xeno of NASA, we would 
like your input on this matter.</i>

15:37.870 --> 15:42.250
<i>Yeah, it does sink in water, 
but it's a bit light to be rock.</i>

15:42.660 --> 15:46.530
<i>Maybe it's a porous rock, like pumice.</i>

15:48.770 --> 15:50.860
<i>Worth a shot, then.</i>

15:51.220 --> 15:54.930
Hiromatsu High School

15:52.210 --> 15:54.930
We're making gasoline out 
of plastic bottle caps.

15:55.570 --> 15:58.180
Normally you use something porous, like zeolite.

15:58.460 --> 16:02.350
Let's see if this swallow statue's 
wing works just as well.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.490
Listen up, Senku!

16:04.490 --> 16:10.790
I'm going to confess the feelings I've had 
for Yuzuriha for the past five years!

16:10.790 --> 16:12.030
Yeah?

16:12.030 --> 16:15.280
Well, that sure does sound interesting.

16:16.530 --> 16:19.300
All right, I got some gasoline.

16:19.700 --> 16:24.120
Throw this on a nuclear magnetic resonance 
machine, and the carbon distribution might

16:24.120 --> 16:28.000
give me some idea of its properties 
and the depths of the pores and stuff.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.190
<i>I'm going to investigate everything.</i>

16:34.800 --> 16:36.350
<i>Try everything.</i>

16:43.310 --> 16:48.650
Today's just a DARPA tech demonstration.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.670
Isn't it?

16:51.310 --> 16:54.630
So why are we, special forces, being invited?

16:54.990 --> 16:58.660
It's so fishy, I can feel my asshole puckering.

17:00.410 --> 17:04.930
It's a gathering of America's 
most talented superheroes.

17:04.930 --> 17:06.210
What is this all about?

17:07.190 --> 17:08.460
This.

17:08.830 --> 17:12.980
A terror attack involving an unknown weapon, 
or an attack by a foreign nation...

17:13.360 --> 17:14.340
Doctor Xeno!

17:14.340 --> 17:16.070
You mustn't show this yet!

17:16.070 --> 17:17.650
Especially not outside!

17:17.650 --> 17:19.120
It doesn't matter.

17:19.120 --> 17:24.600
It's going to be public information after 
tomorrow's expert briefing, anyway.

17:25.810 --> 17:31.420
We can try a potentiometric analysis using 
glass wool electrodes doused in nitric acid.

17:30.660 --> 17:32.940
Yeah, okay, that's enough, Xeno.

17:32.940 --> 17:34.440
What's the conclusion?

17:40.270 --> 17:42.290
What's this?

17:42.290 --> 17:45.750
There's a very slight potential 
difference around the head.

17:46.890 --> 17:48.250
Brain waves.

17:49.470 --> 17:52.060
It's quite elegant, is it not?

17:52.060 --> 17:54.480
This statue is still alive.

17:54.480 --> 17:59.180
Though, with time, their brain 
waves vanish one by one.

17:59.400 --> 18:03.590
But this swallow, for instance, 
is still awake right now.

18:03.590 --> 18:05.700
So if you get hit by this new weapon,

18:05.700 --> 18:10.110
you still have a chance if 
you keep yourself awake.

18:13.790 --> 18:14.900
Miss!

18:14.900 --> 18:18.910
I prepared this. 
I think it would look great on you.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.910
Please have this ring!

18:22.850 --> 18:26.590
Screw your flashy shit, Carlos, you womanizer!

18:27.740 --> 18:28.790
Miss?

18:30.180 --> 18:31.540
What is...

18:33.550 --> 18:34.970
that light?

18:42.480 --> 18:43.560
<i>It's coming!</i>

18:44.030 --> 18:44.940
Retreat!

18:44.940 --> 18:46.220
Get behind cover!

18:46.980 --> 18:51.190
We won't escape petrification, 
but the real test comes after!

18:51.190 --> 18:52.730
Maintain consciousness, no matter what!

18:52.980 --> 18:56.370
We have to protect Luna 
even if it kills us, Carlos!

18:56.370 --> 18:57.740
Of course!

18:58.090 --> 19:00.400
<i>Damn it, the ring!</i>

19:00.400 --> 19:01.930
<i>This belongs to her, though...</i>

19:01.930 --> 19:04.490
<i>so I don't want to let go of it!</i>

19:04.490 --> 19:05.380
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

19:05.380 --> 19:07.200
<i>I'll wash it later!</i>

19:25.510 --> 19:26.680
<i>Shit...</i>

19:26.680 --> 19:28.870
<i>Captain Stanley's orders!</i>

19:28.870 --> 19:30.560
<i>I have to stay awake!</i>

19:31.150 --> 19:32.230
<i>Damn it...</i>

19:32.230 --> 19:34.280
<i>I can't move at all.</i>

19:37.370 --> 19:39.860
<i>No way!</i>

19:39.860 --> 19:41.540
<i>I'm a capable woman!</i>

19:41.540 --> 19:46.120
<i>I'm supposed to date a capable 
man and form a power couple!</i>

19:46.120 --> 19:50.410
<i>I don't wanna die single!</i>

19:50.410 --> 19:53.060
<i>That soldier said to stay awake!</i>

19:53.060 --> 19:55.520
<i>I'm so, so, so, so staying awake!</i>

19:55.520 --> 19:57.770
<i>I'm the cool-headed Luna!
The capable woman, Luna!</i>

19:57.770 --> 20:00.140
<i>I'm the cool-headed Luna!
The capable woman, Luna!</i>

20:00.140 --> 20:02.620
<i>I'm the cool-headed Luna!
The capable woman, Luna!</i>

20:02.620 --> 20:04.970
<i>I'm the cool-headed Luna!
The capable woman, Luna!</i>

20:02.860 --> 20:07.600
<i>I'm not leaving her all alone!</i>

20:04.970 --> 20:07.600
<i>I'm the cool-headed Luna!
The capable woman, Luna!</i>

20:09.000 --> 20:10.230
<i>Sure.</i>

20:10.650 --> 20:13.970
<i>I'm used to staying awake 
and still for days on end.</i>

20:14.360 --> 20:17.060
<i>I get plenty of practice sniping.</i>

20:42.470 --> 20:47.550
<i>Pinnacles National Park, where we were, 
is filled with saltpeter caves.</i>

20:48.510 --> 20:50.040
<i>Which means there must be nitric acid.</i>

20:51.110 --> 20:53.730
<i>I don't know if that's a 
good thing or a bad thing,</i>

20:53.730 --> 20:56.100
<i>but it's better than no denaturation at all.</i>

21:05.380 --> 21:11.650
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six...</i>

21:11.650 --> 21:14.180
<i>seven, eight, nine...</i>

21:14.650 --> 21:19.360
<i>9,157,661,240 seconds.</i>

21:20.030 --> 21:24.120
<i>As long as I stay conscious, 
I'll have a chance to reawaken.</i>

21:26.260 --> 21:28.820
<i>If I do manage to awaken,</i>

21:28.820 --> 21:35.690
<i>I'll want Yellow Dent corn for 
both livestock feed and fuel.</i>

21:36.520 --> 21:40.780
<i>There's one location on the West Coast Corn 
Belt where the corn will have hybridized...</i>

21:40.780 --> 21:46.200
<i>Or better yet, it may have been 
preserved in a dormant state.</i>

21:47.250 --> 21:51.520
<i>If there are any scientists around, 
they'll gather there.</i>

21:55.400 --> 21:58.480
<i>That wouldn't be fate.</i>

21:58.480 --> 22:00.060
<i>It wouldn't even be coincidence.</i>

22:00.520 --> 22:01.630
<i>It would be necessary.</i>

22:02.530 --> 22:04.500
<i>It would be repeatable.</i>

22:04.840 --> 22:06.380
<i>That is the essence...</i>

22:11.990 --> 22:13.200
<i>...of science.</i>
