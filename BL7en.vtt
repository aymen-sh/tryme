<b><i>and ran to where the likely

01:27.240 --> 01:32.850
<b><i>That's the kind of reflex I want to use near

<b>It was a glam save, Mr. Super Reaction.</b>

<b><i>I</i> was watching.</b>

<b>Still, how could he have

<b>An iron defense and a rapid attack.</b>

13:00.650 --> 13:05.280
<b>Because of Itoshi Sae, the U-20s has 
become a significantly stronger team.</b>

13:05.280 --> 13:06.340
<b>Right.</b>

13:07.700 --> 13:11.310
<b><i>First, they defend with four.</i></b>

13:11.820 --> 13:16.020
<b><i>We can't find a decisive way through them,
 so they steal the ball from us.</i></b>

13:16.250 --> 13:19.960
<b><i>That's when the rapid attack 
initiated by Itoshi Sae begins.</i></b>

13:22.060 --> 13:25.080
<b><i>This is the play style of Japan's U-20s.</i></b>

13:26.910 --> 13:28.350
<b><i>How do we break it?</i></b>

13:30.150 --> 13:35.040
<b>The tactics we drilled into them in the
 final training camp don't seem to be working.</b>

13:35.040 --> 13:39.900
<b>Blue Lock Staff</b>

13:35.590 --> 13:38.160
<b>Are we going to be okay, Ego-san?</b>

13:38.160 --> 13:40.630
<b>Well, I guess this is to be expected.</b>

13:40.630 --> 13:43.050
<b>Huh? That sounds so irresponsible.</b>

13:43.050 --> 13:46.130
<b>You see, training is only training, Anri-chan.</b>

13:46.130 --> 13:52.680
<b>Blue Lock
General Director</b>

13:47.130 --> 13:49.660
<b>The only thing that can 
be gained from training</b>

13:49.660 --> 13:52.680
<b>is a simple skill that can 
be executed stress-free.</b>

13:52.740 --> 13:57.360
<b>During</b>

13:52.740 --> 13:57.360
<b>Training</b>

13:53.190 --> 13:57.440
<b>It applies to any field.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.520
<b>During</b>

13:57.360 --> 13:59.520
<b>Training</b>

13:58.310 --> 14:00.620

13:59.520 --> 14:01.650
<b>Thing</b>

14:01.650 --> 14:04.590
<b>Oh, I've experienced that myself.</b>

14:04.590 --> 14:07.150
<b>Like making mistakes at a piano recital.</b>

14:07.150 --> 14:08.540
<b>Precisely.</b>

14:09.310 --> 14:14.330
<b>The decisive difference between 
training and the real thing is stress.</b>

14:15.610 --> 14:21.750
<b>The environment, the opponents, 
your own condition in these situations...</b>

14:22.300 --> 14:27.770
<b>Your mental state, the tension in your 
muscles, a stagnant thought process...</b>

14:28.430 --> 14:33.130
<b>The real thing is filled with factors 
that can drag you into a negative spiral.</b>

14:33.790 --> 14:36.800
<b>There's no way things will happen
 how you practiced them.</b>

14:37.660 --> 14:41.270
<b>But there's one way to 
break through that burden.</b>

14:42.280 --> 14:43.480
<b>Improvise.</b>

14:43.900 --> 14:47.090
<b>What? So you're not gonna
 give them any instructions?</b>

14:47.090 --> 14:48.790
<b>But if you just sit and watch...</b>

14:48.790 --> 14:50.710
<b>Be quiet and have faith in them.</b>

14:50.710 --> 14:52.990
<b>Our egoists know...</b>

14:54.020 --> 14:55.700
<b>how to handle the real thing.</b>

15:00.130 --> 15:03.080
<b><i>I can't even see the piece we need 
to break through their defense.</i></b>

15:03.500 --> 15:06.580
<b><i>To me, they're formidable enemies
with unknown potential.</i></b>

15:07.230 --> 15:08.050
<b><i>But...</i></b>

15:08.780 --> 15:11.540
<b>Just keep your eyes on me.</b>

15:12.580 --> 15:14.430
<b><i>What I have to do is clear.</i></b>

15:14.790 --> 15:16.610
<b><i>I'll get rid of any useless thoughts.</i></b>

15:17.070 --> 15:19.520
<b><i>I'll focus every skill I have...</i></b>

15:20.740 --> 15:23.460
<b><i>into this move with Rin!</i></b>

15:25.690 --> 15:30.280
<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

15:26.350 --> 15:30.280
<b>It's pointless passing it 
around in midfield, yup.</b>

15:30.520 --> 15:34.660
<b>You're hesitant. You have no one to pass to, yup.</b>

15:34.920 --> 15:36.910
<b>Whatever, Mr. Bags Under My Eyes.</b>

15:40.450 --> 15:42.500
<b><i>Shorter passes.</i></b>

15:42.750 --> 15:45.460
<b><i>Is he adjusting our attacking pattern?</i></b>

15:46.220 --> 15:48.380
<b>Not using the triangle anymore, huh?</b>

15:48.680 --> 15:50.210
<b><i>Shut everything else out.</i></b>

15:50.580 --> 15:52.430
<b><i>Stick with Rin's vision...</i></b>

15:52.800 --> 15:54.140
<b><i>and go wild!</i></b>

15:54.140 --> 15:55.850
<b><i>They're passing it faster now.</i></b>

15:58.050 --> 16:00.060
<b><i>I can't quite read these two.</i></b>

16:00.480 --> 16:04.070
<b><i>The No. 11 is constantly 
running around the No. 10,</i></b>

16:04.070 --> 16:07.770
<b><i>giving the No. 10 more options.

16:08.980 --> 16:09.940
<b><i>Crap.</i></b>

16:09.940 --> 16:11.440
<b><i>A heel pass now?</i></b>

16:12.250 --> 16:13.910
<b><i>They drew us out.</i></b>

16:14.610 --> 16:16.070
<b>Nya-hoy!</b>

16:16.530 --> 16:19.040
<b>That link-up play was making me jealous.</b>

16:19.390 --> 16:24.330
<b><i>And you two are now free to 
go up front. Is that the plan?</i></b>

16:25.640 --> 16:27.840
<b><i>There are two center backs behind Nagi.</i></b>

16:27.840 --> 16:31.370
<b><i>It's a three-on-two.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.190
<b><i>A goal chance.</i></b>

16:34.200 --> 16:37.510
<b><i>From here, I'll follow my ego!</i></b>

16:37.510 --> 16:39.890

16:59.550 --> 17:00.690

17:00.690 --> 17:03.640
<b>Nice improvisation, Itoshi Rin.</b>

17:04.200 --> 17:07.460

17:10.820 --> 17:13.470
<b><i>Here he comes.
 He'll take a shot any second now.</i></b>

17:15.480 --> 17:17.050
<b><i>He ran even farther?</i></b>

17:17.050 --> 17:18.760
<b><i>To where he's got zero angle?</i></b>

17:19.550 --> 17:20.930
<b><i>And a left-footed shot?</i></b>

17:21.900 --> 17:25.640
<b><i>Don't tell me he's trying to score

17:54.710 --> 17:56.840

18:20.250 --> 18:21.700
<b><i>Just like in training.</i></b>

18:22.380 --> 18:26.380
