00:18:46.798 --> 00:18:50.558
Stop calling me! Stop calling!

00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:16.988
Geez...

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:21.208
Hello, Mr. Yoon.

00:19:22.408 --> 00:19:26.888
The matchbox you had in the
hallway yesterday. Give it to me.

00:19:30.268 --> 00:19:32.318
Oh, you.

00:19:32.318 --> 00:19:35.848
Who are you? You're so pretty.

00:19:35.848 --> 00:19:38.718
- Mom!
- What do you mean, pretty?

00:19:38.718 --> 00:19:41.908
She looks like a drowning weasel.

00:19:43.108 --> 00:19:45.328
Aren't you going to be
late? Just be quiet and go.

00:19:45.328 --> 00:19:46.938
You little drunkard!

00:19:46.938 --> 00:19:48.968
All right!

00:19:50.238 --> 00:19:51.878
What?

00:19:53.338 --> 00:19:55.728
Hey, wait up!

00:19:55.728 --> 00:19:58.328
- See you later.
- Bye.

00:19:58.328 --> 00:20:03.708
Are you Mr. Yoon's
in-laws' third cousin's...

00:20:03.708 --> 00:20:06.588
Oh, are you Mr. Yoon's relative?

00:20:06.588 --> 00:20:08.568
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:20:08.568 --> 00:20:09.768
Nice to meet you!

00:20:09.768 --> 00:20:11.718
Is it because you resemble Mr. Yoon?

00:20:11.718 --> 00:20:15.668
You look smart. You look smart!

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:24.528
Mr. Yoon said since he can't go with you, he
earnestly requested that you go with Soon Ae.

00:20:24.528 --> 00:20:27.668
Here. While making lunches for
everyone, I made yours and Mr. Yoon's, too.

00:20:27.668 --> 00:20:28.858
Take it and enjoy it.

00:20:28.858 --> 00:20:30.628
- Oh, I have mine too.
- Gosh...

00:20:30.628 --> 00:20:34.998
That's that, and this is this.

00:20:34.998 --> 00:20:37.168
Make sure you chew your food well.

00:20:37.168 --> 00:20:40.548
And come by whenever you want to eat more.

00:20:40.548 --> 00:20:44.318
Oh, my gosh. Come over often, dear.

00:20:44.318 --> 00:20:46.918
Okay. Thank you.

00:20:48.328 --> 00:20:50.048
My goodness...

00:20:53.898 --> 00:20:56.028
My gosh...

00:20:56.028 --> 00:20:57.578
[Bong Bong Cafe]

00:20:58.878 --> 00:21:01.368
- Love letter?
- Yes!

00:21:01.368 --> 00:21:06.378
You're supposed to put a note inside it and
give it to a girl you like or are interested in.

00:21:06.378 --> 00:21:09.028
I'm sure the kids in
other classes all have one.

00:21:09.028 --> 00:21:12.838
Because it's a trend at
our school these days.

00:21:14.608 --> 00:21:18.488
Things became more complicated
because of that damn trend.

00:21:18.488 --> 00:21:19.818
What?

00:21:21.898 --> 00:21:23.928
Love?

00:21:23.928 --> 00:21:25.448
What do you love?

00:21:25.448 --> 00:21:27.118
When did you see her to say it's love?

00:21:27.118 --> 00:21:30.908
I have a different one for the transfer
student. That's for someone else.

00:21:30.908 --> 00:21:34.918
If there's someone else, why
are you giving her one, too?

00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:36.688
Why are you dodging? Dodging?

00:21:36.688 --> 00:21:39.008
Fine! I won't give it to her then!

00:21:39.008 --> 00:21:40.698
Why are you hitting me?

00:21:40.698 --> 00:21:42.668
Get back here!

00:21:48.448 --> 00:21:50.458
What do I do?

00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:12.798
What's taking so long?

00:22:14.158 --> 00:22:17.998
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:22:44.848 --> 00:22:49.488
At the time, the decisive reason Yoo
Beom Ryong became a suspect was

00:22:49.488 --> 00:22:52.838
because of the things he kept hidden.

00:23:34.718 --> 00:23:37.658
You don't have anything yet. Is that it?

00:23:52.678 --> 00:23:54.668
What's this?

00:23:56.318 --> 00:24:00.018
I'm sorry about yesterday.

00:24:01.318 --> 00:24:05.818
You were just trying to help
me, but I spoke too harshly.

00:24:07.228 --> 00:24:10.558
It bothered me, so I
couldn't sleep all night.

00:24:10.558 --> 00:24:12.748
That's why.

00:24:12.748 --> 00:24:17.218
You always wrote letters like this even
though you'd end up telling me about it.

00:24:17.948 --> 00:24:21.018
You used to do that every time
we fought from a long time ago.

00:24:21.018 --> 00:24:22.608
I did?

00:24:23.288 --> 00:24:25.008
When?

00:24:28.298 --> 00:24:30.338
Oh, I meant my mom.

00:24:30.338 --> 00:24:32.498
I suddenly thought of her.

00:24:34.108 --> 00:24:37.338
She must have really liked writing.

00:24:40.868 --> 00:24:42.438
I guess so.

00:24:47.318 --> 00:24:52.768
I'm only realizing now...
that must've been the reason.

00:24:58.268 --> 00:25:01.158
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:25:06.048 --> 00:25:08.008
Second skull?

00:25:09.778 --> 00:25:12.378
Mr. Yoon, yes.

00:25:12.378 --> 00:25:15.188
That matchbox you're holding. Hand it over.

00:25:15.188 --> 00:25:16.808
Excuse me?

00:25:17.618 --> 00:25:21.018
I have a matchbox in my school bag? Where?

00:25:22.528 --> 00:25:26.288
Geez, you can't just search
through someone's bag.

00:25:27.218 --> 00:25:30.738
Oh, my gosh! It's really in there.

00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:34.698
You couldn't have known the trend at this
school since you transferred yesterday.

00:25:34.698 --> 00:25:38.298
So, what's this cafe matchbox
doing in a student's bag?

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:41.578
What is it?

00:25:42.848 --> 00:25:45.058
Oh, yeah! That's it!

00:25:45.058 --> 00:25:48.438
On Sunday, my hyung came
and let me have a taste of coffee.

00:25:48.438 --> 00:25:51.338
So we went to a cafe in town
and built a tower with these.

00:25:51.338 --> 00:25:54.188
It was so much fun! And he also...

00:25:54.188 --> 00:25:56.298
You still have the lock?

00:25:56.298 --> 00:25:58.518
Yes, of course.

00:25:59.318 --> 00:26:01.868
L-Lock?

00:26:02.929 --> 00:26:04.638
Why is your bag so light?

00:26:04.638 --> 00:26:07.428
Then would I bring books to a picnic?

00:26:07.428 --> 00:26:10.618
Your aunt didn't pack you lunch?

00:26:10.618 --> 00:26:12.288
Oh, no. It's not like that.

00:26:12.288 --> 00:26:16.208
She packed me lunch,
but I just forgot to bring it.

00:26:16.208 --> 00:26:19.328
Tell the kids to look for my bag.

00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:22.058
Since I searched your
bag, you can search mine.

00:26:22.058 --> 00:26:23.571
You can have the lunch
box that's in my bag.

00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:25.781
Buy a drink for yourself...

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:33.948
Buy some for kids in the next class, too.

00:26:34.848 --> 00:26:37.138
I'm sending you on an errand.

00:26:37.138 --> 00:26:38.648
Yes.

00:26:41.208 --> 00:26:45.608
There was a fire in Rochester's room
so Jane put it out with the water bucket.

00:26:45.608 --> 00:26:49.738
Then he held her hand like this
and said, "You saved my life."

00:26:49.738 --> 00:26:52.428
So how could I not read what follows next?

00:26:53.168 --> 00:26:56.768
That's how I got hit by my mom in the end.

00:26:57.608 --> 00:27:00.128
But you were reading.
What's wrong with that?

00:27:00.128 --> 00:27:02.718
She doesn't like me reading books.

00:27:02.718 --> 00:27:07.798
She says that I'm into useless things,
wasting my time instead of doing housework.

00:27:07.798 --> 00:27:09.618
Oh, gosh.

00:27:09.618 --> 00:27:16.158
I would love to read as many books as I'd like,
listen to all the music, and sip on hot coffee.

00:27:16.158 --> 00:27:18.278
I'd love to live like that.

00:27:21.108 --> 00:27:23.648
In the end,

00:27:23.648 --> 00:27:26.258
Mom's dream came true.

00:27:26.258 --> 00:27:28.218
Through me.

00:27:40.538 --> 00:27:42.258
What?

00:27:43.618 --> 00:27:46.188
I'm just happy.

00:27:46.188 --> 00:27:47.738
If you're finished, give me the cup.

00:27:47.738 --> 00:27:49.698
I can do it when I'm done.

00:27:49.698 --> 00:27:51.898
Just give it to me.
I'll do stuff like this.

00:27:51.898 --> 00:27:55.988
My daughter should just
read as much as she wants.

00:27:59.218 --> 00:28:07.258
♫ I wish that my heart could reach you ♫

00:28:07.258 --> 00:28:11.868
♫ No longer, no longer,
no longer selfishly ♫

00:28:11.868 --> 00:28:19.228
♫ I will be able to look at you ♫

00:28:19.228 --> 00:28:21.028
Why?

00:28:21.698 --> 00:28:23.088
Gosh...

00:28:23.088 --> 00:28:28.008
Oh, just... I was just curious
about what you were listening to.

00:28:32.198 --> 00:28:33.548
Give it to me. I'll do it.

00:28:33.548 --> 00:28:34.878
Goodness! It's all right.

00:28:34.878 --> 00:28:38.138
When you get married later,
you'll do it until you get sick of it.

00:28:39.068 --> 00:28:41.938
I won't disturb you. Just keep listening.

00:28:41.938 --> 00:28:43.608
Geez, talking about marriage.

00:28:43.608 --> 00:28:46.058
I keep telling you I won't get married.

00:28:46.988 --> 00:28:49.218
Mom...

00:28:49.218 --> 00:28:55.018
had given me the time
that wasn't given to her.

00:28:57.848 --> 00:28:59.188
What are you doing?

00:28:59.188 --> 00:29:02.938
Now, I'll return them to you, Mom.

00:29:02.938 --> 00:29:07.788
The time you lost and
everything you gave up.

00:29:07.788 --> 00:29:11.438
I will make sure to
return everything to you.

00:29:11.438 --> 00:29:15.188
We're going to be late! We have to run!

00:29:15.188 --> 00:29:17.728
But why are you going that
way? Isn't school this way?

00:29:17.728 --> 00:29:22.478
Didn't you hear at the end of class
yesterday? We're going on a picnic today.

00:29:29.618 --> 00:29:31.438
Oh, yeah.

00:29:31.438 --> 00:29:33.068
Wait for me!

00:29:33.068 --> 00:29:34.978
- Kim Hae Kyeong.
- Yes.

00:29:34.978 --> 00:29:37.048
- Lee Eun Ha.
- Yes.

00:29:37.048 --> 00:29:38.968
- Park Yoo Ri.
- Yes.

00:29:38.968 --> 00:29:41.058
- Seo Ji Yoon.
- Yes.

00:29:41.058 --> 00:29:43.758
- Yoon Young.
- Yes.

00:29:43.758 --> 00:29:45.318
- Won Soo Kyeong.
- Yes.

00:29:45.318 --> 00:29:47.158
- Dae Kyeon.
- Geez.

00:29:47.158 --> 00:29:49.250
Geez.

00:29:51.478 --> 00:29:53.288
Mr. Yoon.

00:29:54.908 --> 00:29:57.628
- Mr. Yoon.
- Yes, what?

00:29:57.628 --> 00:29:59.998
Why are you standing here like this?

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:02.588
Aren't you checking the kids in your class?

00:30:02.588 --> 00:30:04.708
Look! Just look at them!

00:30:04.708 --> 00:30:08.228
- Let's go!
- I got it!

00:30:10.748 --> 00:30:13.148
Just look at them! What a mess!

00:30:13.148 --> 00:30:16.028
Those who don't study always make a fuss.

00:30:16.028 --> 00:30:21.068
I clearly wrote down not to be
late, and... she's making me nervous!

00:30:21.068 --> 00:30:23.558
Wait! Why are you going that way?

00:30:23.558 --> 00:30:24.678
Hey, you!

00:30:24.678 --> 00:30:27.268
Do it lightly!

00:30:32.878 --> 00:30:38.058
Man, why did the principal
put our classes together?

00:30:38.058 --> 00:30:40.278
Geez!

00:30:41.628 --> 00:30:46.088
Cotton candies, get away
from them! You punks.

00:30:49.818 --> 00:30:51.558
Seon Jeong Sook!

00:31:13.418 --> 00:31:18.818
How does the second skull know
that I'm friends with the padlock?

00:31:45.778 --> 00:31:52.268
♫ Susan, the chilly winds are blowing ♫

00:31:52.268 --> 00:31:58.558
♫ Susan, as dusk approaches ♫

00:31:58.558 --> 00:32:01.398
♫ Where are you right now, all lonely? ♫

00:32:01.398 --> 00:32:03.268
Soon Ae!

00:32:04.298 --> 00:32:06.368
At the bus terminal?

00:32:06.368 --> 00:32:11.408
♫ Why don't you come to me? ♫

00:32:11.408 --> 00:32:14.848
Seeing as we meet here
again, destiny must be...

00:32:14.848 --> 00:32:17.438
Cut the crap about destiny!

00:32:25.208 --> 00:32:27.808
Soon Ae, listen carefully.

00:32:27.808 --> 00:32:32.798
This... This is what you
call a real waste of time.

00:32:32.798 --> 00:32:34.588
What kind of bullshit is this?

00:32:34.588 --> 00:32:40.328
This guy will not... help your
life in any way in the future.

00:32:40.328 --> 00:32:42.498
She seems really tired.

00:32:42.498 --> 00:32:44.348
Should we go ahead first?

00:32:44.348 --> 00:32:46.708
Oh, yeah. But...

00:32:46.708 --> 00:32:48.558
Where do you think you're going?

00:32:48.558 --> 00:32:52.538
She's having a hard
time, so she should rest.

00:32:52.538 --> 00:32:55.428
Come after you rest awhile.

00:32:58.368 --> 00:32:59.568
Hey!

00:32:59.568 --> 00:33:01.838
Hey! Soon Ae!

00:33:01.838 --> 00:33:03.478
Soon Ae!

00:33:03.478 --> 00:33:05.358
Geez!

00:33:07.858 --> 00:33:09.658
Oh, my gosh!

00:33:27.118 --> 00:33:29.618
Because the sky is so beautiful.

00:33:39.998 --> 00:33:41.848
- Geez.
- Oh, gosh.

00:33:41.848 --> 00:33:46.668
Why are there so many uphills?
Why have a picnic in a place like this?

00:33:47.348 --> 00:33:52.148
It's a very difficult trail
for someone born in 1965.

00:33:54.578 --> 00:33:58.658
There, there! When it's time
to play, you should just play.

00:33:58.658 --> 00:34:03.898
You shouldn't be worrying about your college exams
here and secretly looking through your textbooks.

00:34:03.898 --> 00:34:07.458
- Hey, Beom Ryong!
- Beom Ryong!

00:34:08.868 --> 00:34:11.898
Okay, okay. Play as much as you want today.

00:34:11.898 --> 00:34:13.828
On one condition. Just within this area.

00:34:13.828 --> 00:34:16.198
- You got that?
- Yes!

00:34:16.198 --> 00:34:18.648
Activity Moderator, come out.

00:34:18.648 --> 00:34:21.828

Okay.

00:49:34.928 --> 00:49:37.448
So what's my weakness that you found?

00:49:41.348 --> 00:49:44.018
The button that gets my reaction.

00:49:44.018 --> 00:49:46.987
Secret cards to use against me.

00:49:46.987 --> 00:49:49.057
You know, don't you?

00:49:50.318 --> 00:49:53.088
It was too easy. I didn't
even have to look for it.

00:49:54.768 --> 00:49:56.488
Soon Ae?

00:49:58.718 --> 00:50:00.898
Lee Soon Ae is your weakness.

00:50:01.928 --> 00:50:05.178
It's still a mystery as to why
she is your weakness, though.

00:50:10.848 --> 00:50:13.078
If you know, then don't forget it.

00:50:13.078 --> 00:50:16.088
My warning from yesterday is still valid.

00:50:20.988 --> 00:50:23.378
You know my brother?

00:50:24.198 --> 00:50:28.748
Do you think I would like
what happened to him...

00:50:28.748 --> 00:50:31.488
or the opposite?

00:50:33.818 --> 00:50:35.768
"Like"?

00:50:39.308 --> 00:50:41.988
That word itself is unexpected, but

00:50:41.988 --> 00:50:44.038
do I need to know that?

00:50:46.428 --> 00:50:48.608
You'll have to.

Right. We have plenty of time.

If, by any chance, she doesn't
know what's going to take place here,

00:51:50.908 --> 00:51:53.148
I need to let her know now.

00:51:54.058 --> 00:51:57.338
Since we don't know what
will happen from now on.

00:52:12.508 --> 00:52:14.348

about her first impression...]

No, it can't be.

00:54:04.998 --> 00:54:09.668
It could be a description of a
scene she actually saw in the past.

00:54:11.938 --> 00:54:14.728
There was something peculiar...

00:54:15.708 --> 00:54:18.248
about her first impression.

00:54:18.248 --> 00:54:24.008
Two dark eyebrows that contrast
against her pale and soft face.

00:54:24.008 --> 00:54:29.288
Or a unique wooden ring
on her thin index finger.

00:54:29.288 --> 00:54:36.388
Or worn-out sneakers that
didn't match her neat outfit.

00:54:49.088 --> 00:54:52.008
That's why she seemed familiar.
