WEBVTT

00:13.610 --> 00:15.690
B-Boss...

00:16.880 --> 00:18.840
Where did these guys come from?

00:18.840 --> 00:22.500
Right, I guess you haven't seen them before.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.760
They're a part of one of my skills.

00:26.380 --> 00:30.110
This kind of thing is possible? Using skills?

00:30.940 --> 00:34.260
It's hard to explain, but yeah.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.580
Boss...

00:56.100 --> 01:00.240
The least you could do is let me 
collect the essence stones.

01:04.170 --> 01:07.380
Th-Thank you!

01:15.400 --> 01:17.180
Oh, no!

01:19.150 --> 01:20.270
Jesus!

01:22.700 --> 01:26.120
Hey. Could you not yell like that?

01:26.120 --> 01:29.680
Don't panic. They're just unconscious.

01:30.540 --> 01:33.020
Then again, it makes sense 
you wouldn't understand.

01:33.020 --> 01:35.700
It's not like I know English.

01:41.690 --> 01:43.210
I'm human.

01:43.690 --> 01:46.430
I want to go home.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.970
Cheers!

03:28.410 --> 03:31.070
That's nineteen raids cleared, as per our deal.

03:31.070 --> 03:34.660
And it's thanks to you that we 
pulled it off safe and sound, Boss.

03:35.220 --> 03:37.170
So, what's next for you?

03:37.170 --> 03:39.900
First comes passing the written 
exam at the Association

03:39.900 --> 03:41.990
so I can get a guild master's license.

03:41.990 --> 03:45.460
Once I have that, I'll start 
negotiating with my father.

03:45.460 --> 03:46.250
I see.

03:46.820 --> 03:49.330
What about you? What are your plans?

03:53.450 --> 03:55.920
I'll probably be out of touch for a while.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.260
Need to travel for a bit.

04:00.930 --> 04:02.010
What?

04:05.790 --> 04:10.560
Boss, if you think I'm a pain 
to put up with, you can just say it.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.120
I won't need to bother you anymore, so...

04:16.530 --> 04:18.470
Are you drunk already?

04:19.120 --> 04:22.330
I have a brother. He's ten years older.

04:22.850 --> 04:28.670
He's never liked me... and we never 
really did anything brotherly together.

04:29.210 --> 04:35.670
On the other hand, you not only saved my life 
but did so much to help me, as well...

04:36.960 --> 04:41.800
I can't help but wish 
<i>you</i> were my older brother.

05:01.420 --> 05:02.650
In that case...

05:07.760 --> 05:11.040
Starting today, I'll consider you 
my little brother.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.460
Bro...!

05:21.670 --> 05:25.480
Eat up! All the meat you want! 
I'll make sure more is grilled in time!

05:25.480 --> 05:27.680
Whoa, slow down!

05:27.680 --> 05:28.930
Do you like lemon juice on yours?!

05:28.930 --> 05:31.520
No! You really are drunk, aren't you?

05:31.520 --> 05:33.630
I've never been more sober in my life!

05:34.340 --> 05:37.480
Seriously... You can be such a handful.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.180
Do we know where he's from?

05:44.590 --> 05:47.350
He claims to be a foreign hunter.

05:47.350 --> 05:52.480
Says he was trapped inside a gate 
ten years ago, unable to leave.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.940
And that at some point he found an exit 
that took him to a gate in America.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.990
That'd be unprecedented. Anything else?

06:00.440 --> 06:05.260
He can't speak English, 
so we're waiting for an interpreter.

06:05.260 --> 06:08.510
We can't rule out the possibility 
that he's a humanoid magic beast.

06:08.510 --> 06:10.310
And if he is?

06:10.590 --> 06:13.600
I requested the assistance 
of an S-Rank hunter—

06:13.600 --> 06:16.060
a fellow countryman of his 
who lives in Washington.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.840
Mr. Hwang, I take it?

06:19.280 --> 06:22.460
We'll begin questioning as soon as he arrives.

06:23.360 --> 06:27.680
That's a relief. 
Do we have name for our guest?

06:27.680 --> 06:30.490
I'm not positive about 
the pronunciation, but...

06:31.500 --> 06:34.250
I think it's Il-hwan Sung.

06:40.780 --> 06:42.970
I'll be gone for a week.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.740
First work, now travel?

06:45.740 --> 06:47.700
You're keeping busy lately.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.710
Plenty to do, that's all.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.980
So? Who are you going with?

06:56.610 --> 06:58.470
Like I told you, a friend.

06:58.470 --> 07:01.020
Seriously, though, when'd you meet her?!

07:08.490 --> 07:12.760
<i>I was around level 20 
when I fought the Cerberus.</i>

07:13.350 --> 07:15.690
<i>I'm three times that now.</i>

07:16.420 --> 07:19.020
<i>This should be easier.</i>

07:37.890 --> 07:40.070
I guess I should move along.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.240
A quest?

07:50.850 --> 07:56.380
"Demons roam this castle. 
Gather their souls."

07:56.810 --> 07:59.540
To clear it I need to collect...

07:59.540 --> 08:00.960
ten thousand demon souls?!

08:02.100 --> 08:04.000
There's that many in here?

08:07.680 --> 08:11.350
<i>I haven't lost sight 
of my real objective, though.</i>

08:14.170 --> 08:16.660
<i>I don't care how many thousands 
of demons there are...</i>

08:18.900 --> 08:20.350
<i>I'll deal with them.</i>

08:26.990 --> 08:30.190
You want to take over the guild?

08:30.190 --> 08:30.990
Yes, sir.

08:33.800 --> 08:38.130
And you're asking this, knowing full well 
that Jinsung is already working on it?

08:39.100 --> 08:42.790
I think that his plan for bringing in 
someone from the outside to run the guild

08:42.790 --> 08:45.500
bears too many risks for the company.

08:47.050 --> 08:50.380
This hunter of yours. 
His name is Sung Jinwoo, right?

08:50.800 --> 08:55.270
The double dungeon, the raid where 
Hwang Dongsuk's team was wiped out,

08:55.270 --> 08:58.730
and the incident where a Surveillance Team 
hunter murdered a group of convicts...

08:59.000 --> 09:02.100
He was present for all three of those, 
and yet made it out of each alive.

09:04.020 --> 09:07.430
He's also been a participant in all 
of the raids you've run, correct?

09:09.300 --> 09:13.700
And in the red gate that the White Tiger 
Guild encountered the other day,

09:14.280 --> 09:18.250
it was apparently Hunter Sung 
who led the survivors to safety.

09:21.770 --> 09:26.560
You were only able to get that guild 
master's license with his help, right?

09:26.930 --> 09:29.210
And you're still asking me 
to turn over the guild to you?

09:33.710 --> 09:34.890
Even so...

09:37.610 --> 09:42.920
Even so, I want to be the one 
running the Yoojin Guild!

09:45.210 --> 09:47.430
The way that Jinsung wants 
to do things will—

09:47.430 --> 09:50.110
All right. We'll try it your way.

09:51.260 --> 09:53.020
Under one condition.

09:55.970 --> 10:00.290
I hear the White Tiger Guild has been 
preparing to scout Hunter Sung

10:00.290 --> 10:02.610
ever since the red gate incident.

10:03.300 --> 10:06.450
I want him with us instead.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.450
Can you arrange that?

10:10.710 --> 10:11.670
I'll do it!

10:15.670 --> 10:17.200
I hope so.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.470
<i>Not sure why, but it doesn't seem 
like I can extract these demons.</i>

10:25.870 --> 10:28.230
<i>Seems like a waste, considering the numbers.</i>

10:36.680 --> 10:39.940
<i>An entry permit for the next floor?</i>

10:42.320 --> 10:45.870
<i>Makes sense. And I guess 
that's where I use it.</i>

10:46.440 --> 10:49.050
<i>This dungeon really is huge, though.</i>

10:49.050 --> 10:52.090
<i>An entire city inside of a building.</i>

10:54.070 --> 10:56.370
<i>All this walking is getting to be a pain.</i>

11:05.710 --> 11:08.180
The ice bear pack leader...

11:08.180 --> 11:09.550
Talk about huge.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.210
All right, let's get going.

11:17.350 --> 11:19.200
What a pain in the—

11:29.240 --> 11:30.340
Nice!

11:32.310 --> 11:34.730
I think I'm gonna call you "Tank."

11:50.230 --> 11:51.720
It's Miss Hae-in!

11:51.720 --> 11:53.280
We hardly ever see her here.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.620
But she always looks amazing!

11:58.360 --> 11:59.740
<i>But why?</i>

11:59.740 --> 12:04.830
Why keep the reports of the flying ants 
confidential, instead of publicizing it?

12:05.620 --> 12:07.520
Association orders.

12:07.520 --> 12:11.320
They say making the information public 
at this stage would only cause a panic.

12:11.320 --> 12:12.250
But...

12:12.580 --> 12:16.710
Don't worry. For the time being, 
we need to build our strength.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.530
As the largest domestic guild,

12:19.530 --> 12:22.060
<i>doing so will help us execute 
our duties, as well as expand.</i>

12:24.930 --> 12:29.830
<i>I was afraid this was an S-Rank 
dungeon when I got that key...</i>

12:30.490 --> 12:32.860
<i>But these demons seem to be around 
the upper end of B Rank.</i>

12:34.230 --> 12:38.630
<i>There's a ton of them, and they 
get stronger the higher I go...</i>

12:38.630 --> 12:42.880
<i>But by only killing the demons I need 
to proceed past each floor,</i>

12:42.880 --> 12:44.660
<i>I've been able to make pretty brisk progress.</i>

12:46.420 --> 12:50.790
<i>That said, if the Demon's Castle is laid out 
the same way the original tower is,</i>

12:50.790 --> 12:53.140
<i>that'll mean 100 floors.</i>

12:53.890 --> 12:58.300
<i>How strong will I be 
by the time I reach the top?</i>

12:59.880 --> 13:02.180
<i>How long will my supplies hold out?</i>

13:02.700 --> 13:04.550
<i>Then there's my promise to Jinah.</i>

13:05.640 --> 13:09.090
<i>This is turning into a battle against time.</i>

13:23.780 --> 13:25.890
<i>Just how far can I get?</i>

13:39.950 --> 13:41.050
<i>This one's red.</i>

13:50.320 --> 13:52.840
Hunter Sung wasn't home.

13:53.890 --> 13:58.980
Only his sister is there, 
and all she knows is that he's on a trip.

13:59.430 --> 14:02.220
We came all the way to his house for nothing.

14:02.220 --> 14:05.580
There's been no record of him 
participating in any raids recently,

14:05.580 --> 14:07.510
but also no sign of him leaving the country.

14:07.510 --> 14:12.590
The last trace the Association has of him 
is smack in the middle of a city.

14:12.590 --> 14:15.170
Wait, you were able to find all that out?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.200
It's part of the job.

14:20.550 --> 14:24.090
Where could he be?

14:24.470 --> 14:27.370
I'll take on the big boss-class enemy.

14:27.370 --> 14:30.020
I want the rest of you 
to wipe the others out.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.990
<i>Now that I have more points 
in my intellect ability,</i>

14:46.990 --> 14:50.950
<i>I'm able to summon more soldiers and 
have more magical power to maintain them.</i>

14:50.950 --> 14:53.170
<i>Combat's become a lot easier.</i>

14:53.900 --> 14:58.180
<i>That said... Is he ever gonna get up?</i>

14:58.180 --> 15:01.140
<i>I guess if he won't move, I'd better—</i>

15:08.050 --> 15:10.760
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

15:15.810 --> 15:20.190
All I did was punch him... 
Did I overlevel my strength?

15:25.940 --> 15:27.610
This is just like with the Cerberus!

15:33.040 --> 15:34.170
Iron!

15:43.900 --> 15:45.720
<i>This flurry of attacks isn't slowing...</i>

15:45.720 --> 15:47.880
<i>How is someone so big so fast?!</i>

15:48.300 --> 15:51.760
<i>Still, sooner or later, I'll have my opening.</i>

15:52.720 --> 15:53.790
<i>Now!</i>

15:57.140 --> 15:58.380
Got you!

16:00.060 --> 16:00.940
No—

16:06.910 --> 16:10.450
<i>This thing can anticipate my moves?</i>

16:10.880 --> 16:15.160
<i>The only part of him that looks vulnerable 
are those beady little eyes.</i>

16:19.870 --> 16:22.790
<i>I need to keep him from 
being able to zip around.</i>

16:23.880 --> 16:24.750
<i>What can I use?</i>

16:26.340 --> 16:27.430
<i>There!</i>

16:38.390 --> 16:41.350
Got a little too focused on me, didn't you?

17:02.530 --> 17:05.360
They say you're a magic beast who can talk.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.550
And like I said, I'm no beast.

17:09.550 --> 17:14.290
If you need proof, I'll submit 
to a DNA test, or whatever.

17:14.290 --> 17:18.650
Shut up. I don't want to hear your voice 
unless it's to answer my questions.

17:18.650 --> 17:22.520
I'm pretty pissed about having my fun delayed.

17:22.520 --> 17:27.270
Unbelievable... They even went 
and wrote a bunch of crap down.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.720
Can I ask you something?

17:29.720 --> 17:31.910
I told you to shut up!

17:31.910 --> 17:36.400
How much has humanity learned 
about gates and magic beasts?

17:36.400 --> 17:37.040
Huh?

17:37.040 --> 17:41.180
How much do you know about 
gates and magic beasts?

17:41.180 --> 17:43.290
What exactly are you asking?

17:43.770 --> 17:48.950
The dungeons, the gates, the beasts... 
They're just the tip of the iceberg.

17:48.950 --> 17:53.420
The power capable of bringing forth 
the ultimate catastrophe has awakened.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.010
And what's that supposed to be?

17:55.530 --> 17:58.950
An ultimate catastrophe. 
Not much else I can say.

18:00.090 --> 18:01.320
And?

18:03.120 --> 18:06.900
My goal is to avert that catastrophe.

18:08.530 --> 18:11.040
I've had enough chitchat.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.980
Do you realize how many hunters 
there are in the world?

18:13.980 --> 18:15.820
Put enough of them together...

18:15.820 --> 18:19.660
Numbers won't help. Not against this threat.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.200
They'll be devoured and used against us.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.330
You seem fairly strong yourself, but...

18:24.330 --> 18:25.120
But what?

18:27.490 --> 18:31.690
Not every day you see a magic beast 
with a name of his own.

18:31.690 --> 18:35.340
Not to mention a wife and two kids.

18:38.190 --> 18:40.640
Do you remember your son's name?

18:41.270 --> 18:42.350
Jinwoo.

18:44.430 --> 18:46.830
What's with the murderous glare?

18:48.060 --> 18:50.980
I'm not answering your questions! Got it?

18:50.980 --> 18:51.950
You will this ti—

18:51.950 --> 18:53.800
Screw you. No.

18:54.340 --> 18:57.320
But I'll tell you this much:

18:58.280 --> 19:00.790
Your son's dead.

19:01.830 --> 19:06.000
If you have anything to tell him, you can 
do it when you meet in the next world!

19:21.700 --> 19:24.490
I'll admit, this is getting kind of one-sided.

19:24.890 --> 19:27.430
Shocked by how tough my soldiers are?

19:27.900 --> 19:30.320
Didn't expect it to turn out like this?

19:30.920 --> 19:33.320
I guess even the undead can feel fear.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.040
Oh, well.

19:52.670 --> 19:54.050
Over here!

19:54.050 --> 19:55.320
Get a move on!

19:55.320 --> 19:59.690
I'd heard that fights between S-Ranks 
could change the shape of the landscape,

19:59.690 --> 20:02.540
laying waste to everything...

20:02.540 --> 20:04.720
I guess we should consider ourselves fortunate.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.310
Yeah. It could have been much worse.

20:07.310 --> 20:09.940
It was so fast... Almost instantaneous.

20:10.410 --> 20:15.950
Mr. Hwang was defeated. 
Faster than the damage could spread.

20:20.870 --> 20:25.150
I'm out of food. I guess this 
is as far as I go for now.

20:26.500 --> 20:30.630
This is the 75th floor. 
So there's 25 left, I think.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.140
<i>Still a long way to go.</i>

20:33.620 --> 20:36.450
<i>But the gains were worth it.</i>

20:37.440 --> 20:40.440
<i>The earring I got from 
the giant on the 50th floor,</i>

20:41.060 --> 20:43.930
<i>and the necklace from the skeleton just now...</i>

20:44.510 --> 20:49.230
<i>They're useful enough individually, 
but the set bonus is the cherry on top.</i>

20:49.910 --> 20:54.690
<i>And that empty space tells me there's 
one more boss-level beast to go.</i>

20:56.350 --> 20:58.440
<i>This Sphere of Avarice isn't half bad, either.</i>

20:58.440 --> 21:03.760
<i>It doesn't do anything for me personally, 
but it doesn't have to be me who uses it.</i>

21:03.760 --> 21:07.830
<i>In the hands of my magic soldiers, 
it'll double their firepower.</i>

21:08.550 --> 21:13.900
<i>And finally... I was able to choose the 
cursed random loot box as a quest reward.</i>

21:14.750 --> 21:18.020
<i>I was worried I'd never 
get another chance at it.</i>

21:19.480 --> 21:22.730
Another key. I had a feeling it might be.

21:23.910 --> 21:27.380
<i>No details? Then when and where 
am I supposed to use it?</i>

21:29.140 --> 21:31.890
<i>Well, it's not like I was really 
after the key, anyway.</i>

21:33.900 --> 21:38.910
<i>On the 50th floor, I got a World Tree 
Fragment from Avaricious Vulcan.</i>

21:39.770 --> 21:45.870
<i>And on the 75th, I got Spring Water from Echo 
Forest by beating Metus, the Guide of Souls.</i>

21:46.430 --> 21:50.330
<i>That's two out of the three ingredients 
for the Elixir of Life.</i>

21:51.310 --> 21:54.960
Just one more. One more, 
and then Mom will be better.

21:57.170 --> 22:00.230
<i>The next time I come here, I'll finish it.</i>
