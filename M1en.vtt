08:17.850 --> 08:20.470
<b>The worst crime syndicate

08:20.810 --> 08:25.190
<b>They were looking for people
with high magical power in this academy.</b>

08:26.900 --> 08:31.570
<b>In return for helping them out,
Lord Abel gained his power.</b>

08:32.570 --> 08:34.950
<b>Sorry to make you help out.</b>

08:34.950 --> 08:36.370
<b>N-No problem.</b>

08:36.910 --> 08:41.870
<b><i>Why do I have to tag along just to retrieve
a board game he forgot in his room!?</i></b>

08:42.410 --> 08:45.540
<b>Lord Abel gained his third line
by artificial means</b>

08:45.620 --> 08:48.630
<b>thanks to Innocent Zero's power.</b>

08:49.500 --> 08:52.510
<b>Genuine triple-liners
are even more fearsome.</b>

08:53.670 --> 08:58.350
<b>Lord Abel borrowed their power
only to gain more coins.</b>

08:58.640 --> 09:02.310
<b>A small sacrifice for the greater good.</b>

09:02.810 --> 09:04.730
<b>But their response...</b>

09:04.980 --> 09:11.440
<b>It seems whoever Innocent Zero is seeking
has some kind of connection with you.</b>

09:12.230 --> 09:16.570
<b>Be on guard. They are sure to return.</b>

09:17.360 --> 09:20.740
<b>We surely will receive
some form of punishment.</b>

09:21.490 --> 09:24.540
<b>We deserve it for losing sight
of our surroundings.</b>

09:25.540 --> 09:27.370
<b>But Lord Abel just wanted</b>

09:27.580 --> 09:32.800
<b>to create a world where kind people
like his mother could live in peace.</b>

09:34.090 --> 09:37.430
<b>I knew that, yet I...</b>

09:39.800 --> 09:43.220
<b>Thank you for stopping Lord Abel.</b>

09:45.180 --> 09:48.440
<b>You really might be able to make it a reality.</b>
