00:01.980 --> 00:04.400
Your extra dango. 
And your apricot-seed jelly.

00:05.150 --> 00:07.090
Th-Thank you for waiting!

00:07.090 --> 00:08.540
<i>If Granny's right...</i>

00:08.920 --> 00:10.980

00:11.210 --> 00:12.250
Welcome!

00:14.100 --> 00:18.010
<i>then that meeting must have been...</i>

00:19.540 --> 00:22.120
<i>the greatest treasure of my life.</i>

Water.

02:03.810 --> 02:04.850
Please, water.

02:04.850 --> 02:06.480
A-Are you all right?

02:06.720 --> 02:09.060
You need water? Coming right up.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.240
Another!

02:17.560 --> 02:18.770
He wants another.

02:18.770 --> 02:19.990
Gimme a break!

02:20.430 --> 02:21.400
Here you go.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.000
Is this a dango shop?

02:33.140 --> 02:35.110
Yes, and a good one.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.710
You came in here not knowing that?

02:38.060 --> 02:40.960
I suddenly feel peckish.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.680
Okay. There's your seat.

02:45.110 --> 02:47.090
No, I want to sit in the back.

02:47.090 --> 02:49.110
Hey, don't be so picky.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.390
I'm sorry.

02:51.390 --> 02:53.600
We haven't cleared that table yet.

02:53.600 --> 02:57.110
No, no, no! I only want to sit <i>there!</i>

02:57.110 --> 03:01.390
Who the hell do you think you are? 
You rich kids are all spoiled brats.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.810
Taro! That's a customer!

03:03.500 --> 03:04.670
Yes, ma'am!

03:05.260 --> 03:06.280
Taro!

03:07.340 --> 03:08.750
Bring me tea.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.130
<i>You</i> don't get to call me "Taro"!

03:11.670 --> 03:15.880
<b>Anko</b>

03:11.670 --> 03:15.880

<b>Mitarashi</b>

03:11.670 --> 03:15.880
<b>Kinako</b>

03:12.040 --> 03:15.880
We serve four types of dango, 
as well as tricolor dango.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.960
Really? I'll take them all.

03:18.960 --> 03:19.600
Huh?

03:19.600 --> 03:23.640
I've got quite a sweet tooth.
 I'll eat the lot.

03:25.620 --> 03:27.830
It hurts! My tooth hurts!

03:27.830 --> 03:30.150
I forgot about my cavity!

03:30.150 --> 03:31.540
Have some tea.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.020
Nio! Don't humor him!

03:33.740 --> 03:36.820
Hey, just so we're clear, 
you <i>do</i> have money, right?

03:37.680 --> 03:38.560
Money?

03:43.370 --> 03:45.440
Nope. Put it on my tab.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.760
What?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.200
We've got a runner!

03:48.640 --> 03:50.700
You're not going anywhere.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.480
Hajime, guard that door!

03:53.820 --> 03:55.570
I don't take orders from you.

03:58.570 --> 04:03.590
Um, excuse me for asking, 
but did you hurt your left hand?

04:04.910 --> 04:08.220
I merely bumped it. No need to fuss.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.790
W-Welcome to the Chirinuya. Please come in.

04:22.430 --> 04:25.110
"Nio," was it? Flee.

04:25.270 --> 04:26.040
Huh?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.190
<i>Who is this guy? He's dressed all in white.</i>

04:36.480 --> 04:38.260
Leave this place at once.

04:50.180 --> 04:52.850
<i>No way. Is he going to 
swing that thing in here?</i>

04:54.310 --> 04:55.400
<i>He's serious.</i>

04:56.840 --> 04:57.430
Nio!

05:14.500 --> 05:15.700
Brat.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.170
Run for it, everybody!

05:20.170 --> 05:20.720
Hajime!

05:28.280 --> 05:29.600
I've got his sword!

05:31.150 --> 05:32.370
You lose.

05:33.990 --> 05:36.980
Who are you?

05:37.400 --> 05:38.260
We're Miburo.

05:38.610 --> 05:40.820
We keep this city safe.

05:42.180 --> 05:43.800
I see.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.320
I see.

05:55.810 --> 05:57.300
Y-You want some more?

05:59.630 --> 06:01.330
H-He left?

06:01.330 --> 06:04.840
Who does he think he is, 
making a mess of my restaurant?

06:05.600 --> 06:06.780
Are you all right?

06:07.730 --> 06:08.750
Miburo?

06:09.300 --> 06:13.520
I see. I had no idea they had 
children like you in their ranks.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.800
This may be fate.

06:19.050 --> 06:20.850
What was that about?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.100
Taro! Shut that door, too!

06:29.100 --> 06:30.000
Hurry!

06:30.000 --> 06:32.200
Huh? You're not the boss of me!

06:32.200 --> 06:34.080
He's still sitting out there!

06:34.980 --> 06:36.080
What did you say?

06:38.080 --> 06:40.400
Excuse me. What's your name?

06:42.020 --> 06:43.000
Kikuchiyo.

06:43.560 --> 06:47.000
Who are you? Who is that guy?

06:47.720 --> 06:49.130
Why is he after you?

06:55.120 --> 06:58.350
Now, let the festivities begin.

07:01.850 --> 07:03.200
Kikuchiyo-san.

07:04.030 --> 07:06.350
What are you clamming up for?

07:06.350 --> 07:08.990
Tell us already! What are you, slow?

07:09.590 --> 07:14.120
Please, Kikuchiyo-san. I'd like to 
get through this situation somehow.

07:14.630 --> 07:17.750
So please, tell us what you know.

07:20.030 --> 07:23.750
It happened suddenly. 
On the street in broad daylight.

07:25.010 --> 07:26.950
He came at me head-on.

07:27.230 --> 07:30.440
My attendants fought back, 
but it devolved into a brawl.

07:31.520 --> 07:36.430
I fled for my life and took refuge
 in this dango restaurant.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.960
He attacked you in public?

07:39.540 --> 07:41.020
Who is he?

07:41.020 --> 07:46.520
He's crazy. What more do you need to know? 
We can't talk it out with a nutcase.

07:47.540 --> 07:50.680
I wonder how those I left behind fared.

07:51.580 --> 07:53.780
Do you know who he is?

07:54.890 --> 07:56.900
No, I have no idea.

07:58.350 --> 08:03.280
But I can think of any number of reasons 
why someone might want me dead.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.300
What?

08:04.300 --> 08:05.420
Why?

08:05.420 --> 08:07.830
Wh-What kind of crap did you pull?

08:10.280 --> 08:12.820
Stay out!

08:12.820 --> 08:14.310
What's going on? Let us in!

08:17.350 --> 08:18.720
Stop horsing around.

08:19.930 --> 08:21.330
What game are we playing?

08:21.330 --> 08:24.680
Tell us if you're gonna stay over.
We were worried about you.

08:25.100 --> 08:28.430
Hijikata-san. Okita-san. And Todo-san, too.

08:28.430 --> 08:29.450
My!

08:29.730 --> 08:31.500
It's been too long, ma'am.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.320
You haven't gotten any less handsome.

08:34.710 --> 08:37.440
Seems a little early in the day
 to close up shop.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.040
Just shut the door already.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.070
Some wacko in white
is sitting right outside.

08:42.070 --> 08:44.070
Really?

08:44.880 --> 08:46.730
I don't see anyone.

08:46.730 --> 08:48.370
Huh? Where'd he go?

08:50.780 --> 08:53.520
I didn't see anyone wearing white,

08:54.920 --> 09:00.100
but some shady characters are 
keeping an eye on this place.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.900
So he's not alone?

09:03.730 --> 09:05.400
Six in total, I think.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.820
I could tell at a glance that 
they knew their business.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.880
Make that seven. I spotted one around back.

09:12.210 --> 09:17.120
We noticed them on the way in, 
but we couldn't just rush them, you know?

09:17.380 --> 09:19.620
So would you care to fill us in?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.120
I get the feeling 
something fun is going on here.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.870
Oh, this is Kikuchiyo-san.

09:26.840 --> 09:30.380
The scary man in white 
attacked him out of the blue.

09:31.820 --> 09:34.390
"Scary"? What was he like?

09:34.700 --> 09:37.440
He had a sword <i>this</i> long!

09:37.440 --> 09:39.880
And he tried to swing it one-handed!

09:39.880 --> 09:42.430
What? This thing?

09:42.660 --> 09:44.400
How would you even swing it?

09:44.400 --> 09:47.150
Whoa. That's gotta be six shaku long.

09:47.310 --> 09:48.520
<i>Kikuchiyo.</i>

09:49.800 --> 09:51.820
What's bothering you, Hijikata-san?

09:52.320 --> 09:55.400
Well, I've never seen the man myself,

09:55.830 --> 09:58.560
but I've heard that was his childhood name.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.810
Wh-What do you mean?

10:01.100 --> 10:02.460
Could you be...

10:03.080 --> 10:05.040
Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi?

10:05.270 --> 10:06.910
Th-The Shogun?!

10:09.840 --> 10:11.920
Wh-What about the Shogun?

10:12.430 --> 10:16.880
The Shogun's the Shogun, 
genius. Japan's top dog.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.280
I wouldn't say that.

10:19.760 --> 10:25.100
I am the Seii Taishogun, charged to govern
 by command of His Imperial Majesty.

10:25.620 --> 10:28.180
Tokugawa or no, I'm the lord 
of a domain like any other.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.870
Um, I see.

10:30.550 --> 10:32.190
Then, you're really him?

10:32.360 --> 10:36.200
You're Lord Tokugawa Iemochi, 
currently visiting Kyoto?

10:36.420 --> 10:37.200
Indeed.

10:37.430 --> 10:38.840
What?!

10:38.840 --> 10:41.480
For real?! The biggest of big shots?!

10:41.480 --> 10:43.920
But why? You should be in Nijo Castle!

10:44.890 --> 10:45.920
Are you kidding me?

10:47.880 --> 10:51.400
I... I figured that was it!

10:51.400 --> 10:54.400
Mr. Top Dog, sir, I'm yours to the bitter end.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.590
Your wish is my command.

10:56.900 --> 11:00.000
Wow, talk about street smarts.
He changed his tune quick.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.650
He sure knows how to get by.

11:01.950 --> 11:03.460
No, pretty sure he sucks at it.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.930
So what do we do now?

11:05.930 --> 11:08.720
Doesn't this just make things worse?

11:08.720 --> 11:11.950
Good point. Time is of the essence.

11:12.350 --> 11:17.490
True. The way things are now, 
loads of people want the Shogun dead.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.650
L-Let's call more Miburo. 
One of us should run for help.

11:21.650 --> 11:23.430
<i>If</i> we can get out of here.

11:23.940 --> 11:25.810
We'll be done for if they strike first.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.100
We're closer to Nijo Castle here.

11:30.370 --> 11:33.080
We could walk there in under an hour.

11:35.190 --> 11:36.400
We'd never make it.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.220
The answer is obvious.

11:39.460 --> 11:44.210
We'll escort the Shogun to the safety of 
Nijo Castle with only the forces we have here.

11:44.430 --> 11:45.720
That's the only way.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.220
But I can't put you all at risk.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.790
Don't worry.

11:50.210 --> 11:55.100
We Miburo only came from Edo 
in the first place to guard you.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.960
Now, let's talk specifics.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.260
We ought to wait for evening.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.310
I have an idea.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.390
A child? I hardly think—

12:06.390 --> 12:07.450
Good. Let's hear it.

12:07.870 --> 12:09.060
Here's the plan.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.070
First, we split into two groups...

12:19.330 --> 12:22.630
Right. It's time. I hope you're ready.

12:22.920 --> 12:23.510
Yes, sir.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.760
Failure is not an option.

12:25.190 --> 12:26.720
Be ready for anything.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.390
I'm all fired up.

12:30.110 --> 12:33.640
Oh, please, <i>please</i> let us 
make it in one piece.

12:33.660 --> 12:35.150
<b>Conquer</b>

12:37.390 --> 12:39.600
Ma'am, I beg your pardon.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.600
I've brought my troubles 
to your establishment.

12:43.140 --> 12:45.650
Hmph. I don't like you.

12:45.900 --> 12:48.610
G-Granny, that's the <i>Shogun!</i>

12:49.140 --> 12:52.220
I don't care if he's the Shogun 
or the Emperor himself.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.390
Wrong is wrong.

12:54.870 --> 12:58.380
You didn't lift a finger 
to save yourself from that attack.

12:58.380 --> 13:01.200
Anyone would think you were <i>waiting</i> to die.

13:01.380 --> 13:06.640
<b>Conquer</b>

13:01.840 --> 13:06.640
The people on top shouldn't be careless with 
their lives. It makes trouble for us lowly folk.

13:08.640 --> 13:12.610
And leave commoners to commoners.

13:08.640 --> 13:14.650
<b>Conquer</b>

13:12.610 --> 13:14.640
That's not your lookout.

13:14.910 --> 13:17.040
You're a lord, so do a lord's work.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.890
We've all got our own stations 
to stand our ground in.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.660
That's what work's all about.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.160
Look smart, Shogun!

13:31.360 --> 13:32.440
Thank you.

13:33.820 --> 13:38.540
<i>Japan has been cursed with 
a youth like me for a shogun.</i>

13:38.860 --> 13:40.500
Way to go, Granny.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.980
<i>But maybe I'm blessed...</i>

13:41.200 --> 13:43.180
You scared me, Granny!

13:43.180 --> 13:45.040
I'm always putting my life on the line.

13:45.940 --> 13:48.520
<i>to have subjects like these.</i>

13:54.920 --> 13:55.810
Lights.

13:55.810 --> 13:56.800
Here they come.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.570
Take Iemochi's head.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.620
<i>Will I survive?</i>

14:05.640 --> 14:06.320
Let's move.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.550
There they are.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.820
It's Iemochi.

14:13.790 --> 14:15.200
Huh? They split up.

14:15.450 --> 14:16.780
Which way did Iemochi go?

14:16.780 --> 14:19.000
Don't let anyone escape! After them!

14:26.000 --> 14:27.080
There they go.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.480
I see. Quite the stratagem.

14:30.020 --> 14:34.220
But will they be safe? I wouldn't 
want them to die in my place.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.050
Oh, no need to worry about that.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.960
They're as tough as demons.

14:42.430 --> 14:43.480
I'm the Shogun!

14:43.480 --> 14:46.060
The Shogun! The Shogun!

14:44.510 --> 14:46.060
Quiet, you old bat.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.270
Well played, Heisuke.

14:50.270 --> 14:52.080
I love the courtly laugh.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.250
Run for it!

14:53.940 --> 14:58.170
We'll count to 30, then take 
the backstreets to Nijo Castle.

14:58.460 --> 14:59.150
Right.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.500
Well, now. What have we here?

15:07.780 --> 15:10.260
<i>H-How did he know?</i>

15:12.140 --> 15:17.660
So <i>both</i> groups were decoys? 
The numbers added up, though.

15:17.660 --> 15:20.630
Oh, I get it. The old woman.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.050
You planned to sneak Iemochi out after 
we'd left and the hubbub had died down.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.790
Interesting. You thought this through.

15:32.780 --> 15:35.710
Luck really wasn't on your side.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.690
You see...

15:38.190 --> 15:40.480
I only came back for this.

15:41.790 --> 15:45.720
<i>This couldn't be worse. 
It was all for nothing.</i>

15:47.420 --> 15:48.240
Get going.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.680
I'll give you to the count of 10.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.530
<i>He's toying with us. This is a hunt to him.</i>

16:02.760 --> 16:03.560
Kikuchiyo-san!

16:04.720 --> 16:05.430
Let's go.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.980
One.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.110
Two.

16:09.410 --> 16:11.400
Three.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.330
Go on. Run.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.830
Where are we going?
 Are we making for Nijo Castle?

16:30.620 --> 16:32.090
With a slight detour.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.590
We need to lose that guy first.

16:35.020 --> 16:35.660
Right.

16:37.040 --> 16:37.800
Down here.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.600
We'll slip through here.

16:52.780 --> 16:56.110
My, I'm impressed you 
know such narrow alleys.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.520
I was born in this city.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.490
Must be your backyard.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.830
Let's hide here and watch for a bit.

17:06.830 --> 17:09.040
No! I'm dead tired!

17:09.040 --> 17:10.620
Call a palanquin, I say!

17:10.620 --> 17:13.000
Please be reasonable.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.510
What are you doing?

17:15.920 --> 17:20.820
I doubt I can take him in a fair fight, 
so I hope this will come in handy.

17:23.160 --> 17:27.390
I'm a passable swordsman myself, 
but I don't fancy my odds, either.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.500
Excuse me, Kikuchiyo-san...

17:31.210 --> 17:33.020
Oh, I mean, my lord Shogun.

17:34.260 --> 17:35.670
"Kikuchiyo" will do.

17:36.540 --> 17:42.570
Kikuchiyo-san, why did you leave Nijo Castle 
when people are out to get you?

17:43.230 --> 17:44.850
Did you have important business?

17:45.970 --> 17:48.240
My people were reluctant to let me go.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.480
I suppose the outcome has proven them right.

17:59.850 --> 18:02.560
A horse? What's it doing here?

18:06.800 --> 18:08.870
There, there. So you made it.

18:10.460 --> 18:14.360
W-Were you riding this horse, by any chance?

18:14.610 --> 18:15.400
I was.

18:15.850 --> 18:17.280
You must have been terrified.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.860
What's wrong? Do horses frighten you?

18:21.320 --> 18:24.750
N-No, they just make quite 
an impression up close.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.820
To be frank, I'd rather spend 
my life caring for birds and fish.

18:29.050 --> 18:29.750
Huh?

18:30.400 --> 18:32.330
I never expected to become shogun.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.790
Can I do my duty? It doesn't feel real.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.970
I wanted to see people like yourselves.

18:39.510 --> 18:42.440
Commoners, to be blunt.

18:44.460 --> 18:49.800
I wanted to see what sort of people 
I rule over and have a duty to protect.

18:51.190 --> 18:54.580
Can you wait here? 
I'll send someone for you soon.

18:57.880 --> 18:58.780
Um...

18:59.210 --> 19:05.260
I heard you came from Edo to promise the 
Emperor that you'll drive out the foreigners.

19:05.780 --> 19:06.600
That's right.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.540
At least, that's what my entourage thinks.

19:09.540 --> 19:13.040
What? Do you have other ideas, then?

19:14.740 --> 19:16.430
I cannot expel the barbarians.

19:16.430 --> 19:17.280
What?

19:18.400 --> 19:20.360
Y-You <i>can't?</i>

19:20.760 --> 19:21.410
I cannot.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.440
I-I'm sorry. I just...

19:24.440 --> 19:26.440
The ports are already open.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.780
I cannot drive out the foreigners there
and bar any more from entering.

19:34.100 --> 19:37.450
If I close off our land, the world 
will only pull further ahead of us.

19:38.130 --> 19:39.950
We haven't a moment more to waste.

19:40.870 --> 19:42.320
What should we do, then?

19:42.880 --> 19:43.580
I don't know.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.530
Won't opening up the country be disastrous?

19:47.980 --> 19:52.450
I heard we'd be occupied or
 flooded with awful drugs.

19:52.680 --> 19:53.920
The country <i>will</i> open up,

19:54.380 --> 19:56.950
but I won't let the foreigners 
have it all their own way.

19:57.530 --> 20:01.110
We must all think of how to stop them.

20:01.110 --> 20:03.200
The time has come to pool our wisdom.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.960
At least, that's how it seems to me.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.140
I only hope I can convince 
our land to work in concert.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.640
Not everyone will prove receptive.

20:14.570 --> 20:18.200
Japan may split between anti-barbarian 
and pro-trade factions,

20:18.890 --> 20:20.950
although those aren't mutually exclusive.

20:22.450 --> 20:28.450
But I believe there are steps only a
 powerless, incompetent shogun can take.

20:34.170 --> 20:38.230
I won't let it come to civil war. 
Not while I live and breathe.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.150
Some may wish me dead...

20:43.210 --> 20:45.370
but my duty remains.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.000
Kikuchiyo-san.

20:49.310 --> 20:52.520
But, oh, how I hate it!

20:52.770 --> 20:55.310
I wish I could just frolic with my horses.

20:55.310 --> 20:57.430
Being slashed or stabbed must hurt.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.610
I want no part of it.

20:59.610 --> 21:01.640
I'm exhausted. I don't want to walk.

21:02.330 --> 21:04.200
Will you ride back, then?

21:04.700 --> 21:06.540
No. Never.

21:07.310 --> 21:10.240
I can't handle the reins with
 my left hand in this state.

21:10.620 --> 21:12.480
What if I injure the horse?

21:12.480 --> 21:15.310
You're worried about the <i>horse?</i>

21:15.310 --> 21:17.040
Well, of course I am.

21:21.190 --> 21:22.120
Kikuchiyo-san.

21:23.480 --> 21:24.420
Don't worry.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.310
We Miburo...

21:33.530 --> 21:34.960
will keep you safe.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.970
Yes. I'm depending on it.

21:45.030 --> 21:50.040
<b>The
Weakest</b>

21:45.030 --> 21:50.040
<b>Shogun</b>

23:20.170 --> 23:25.550
<b>Next time</b>

23:23.000 --> 23:24.480
Okita Soji here.

23:24.950 --> 23:28.390
Man, I never thought I'd meet the Shogun,

23:28.640 --> 23:31.920
much less save him 
from some tough customers.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.570
It seems like so much fun.

23:33.810 --> 23:37.570
This really was worth leaving Edo for.

23:38.270 --> 23:43.160
Maybe I ought to break out 
my specialty. It's been a while.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.240
Next time: "True Strength."

23:46.810 --> 23:47.980
You won't want to miss it.

23:47.190 --> 23:50.030
<b>True Strength</b>
