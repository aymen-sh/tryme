WEBVTT

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.419
To CP. This is Alpha Two.

00:00:09.502 --> 00:00:12.672
Point One. Nothing
out of the ordinary so far.

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:16.592
Alpha Two, this is CP.
Continue monitoring the situation.

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:32.525
Emergency kaiju alert.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.529
YOKOHAMA GATE
EMERGENCY UNDERGROUND SHELTER

00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:41.075
Emergency kaiju alert for Minami,
Naka, and Isogo Wards.

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:45.538
All those in the designated zones,
please proceed to a shelter immediately.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:50.751
As for the movements of the epicenter...

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.926
The target is moving
from Yatobashi to Yamashitacho.

00:00:59.677 --> 00:01:03.598
{\an8}Estimated full length is 60 meters.
Fortitude is a little less than 3,5.

00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:18.279
-No thermal detection for 3 kilometers.
-Roger that.

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:21.073
All crafts, begin shooting. I repeat.

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:23.784
-Begin shooting.
-Roger that.

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:25.578
Leading target to TO.

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:27.371
Shoot.

00:01:33.252 --> 00:01:35.296
Will the intimidation work?

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:37.548
Which division is coming?

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:39.926
It's Yokohama, so, the Third Division.

00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:01.507
Geez, what a mess.

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:06.721
We'll be working overtime for a while.

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:10.016
All right, let's get to work!

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.851
Yes, sir.

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:17.398
Members of the Third Division,
who successfully subdued the kaiju,

00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:19.400
are welcomed by the applause of locals.

00:03:21.527 --> 00:03:24.322
The Third Division
achieved zero casualties.

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:26.240
-Thanks to them...
-Captain Ashiro's here!

00:03:26.324 --> 00:03:27.825
How cool!

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.330
Let us thank them
with applause and cheers.

00:03:32.413 --> 00:03:35.207
Hey, don't forget to film the victims!

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.667
Oh, sorry.

00:03:37.627 --> 00:03:40.171
-Report back to me later!
-Yes, sir!

00:03:40.254 --> 00:03:41.547
Captain Ashiro!

00:03:55.478 --> 00:04:00.358
Our work begins
after everything has ended.

00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:04.236
No one gives us attention.

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:07.698
No one thanks us either.

00:04:08.658 --> 00:04:11.118
But it's our way of battling kaiju,

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:18.584
behind the scenes,
away from the spotlight.

00:04:18.668 --> 00:04:19.585
KAFKA HIBINO

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.172
Kafka! Izumo Tech wants some samples.

00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:26.801
Thanks.

00:04:26.884 --> 00:04:29.595
It's no good! I can't cut past the grease.

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:32.807
-Bring me the heat chainsaw!
-Yes, sir!

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.351
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't lift that yet!

00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:45.361
It's this way! Bring the stretcher.

00:04:45.444 --> 00:04:47.947
Don't worry, it's just the surface.

00:04:48.948 --> 00:04:52.284
I've done this many times.
Don't forget to apply for workers' comp.

00:04:52.368 --> 00:04:53.452
Yes, sir!

00:04:54.453 --> 00:04:57.957
The Third Division's site is always messy.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.792
It's hard to recognize the organs.

00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:02.753
Jesus, look at this.

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:05.965
Will we really finish this week?

00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:11.429
Kafka, we're moving you.

00:05:11.512 --> 00:05:14.056
-We don't have enough people over there.
-Where is it?

00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:16.684
The intestines.

00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:23.024
-I don't want to!
-I already got permission. Let's go!

00:05:23.107 --> 00:05:24.900
Sorry about that!

00:05:24.984 --> 00:05:28.904
I always hear about it,
but is working the intestines that rough?

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:32.658
{\an8}Think about it.
What's inside the intestines?

00:05:32.742 --> 00:05:33.659
{\an8}HOW THE BODY WORKS

00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:36.245
The days we work intestines...

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.499
you can't eat for days.

00:05:50.384 --> 00:05:52.344
I'm so tired!

00:05:52.887 --> 00:05:55.931
Those baby pandas were so cute!

00:05:56.015 --> 00:05:57.558
How will they grow up?

00:05:58.768 --> 00:06:00.519
I can still smell it.

00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:02.772
Let's move on to the next topic.

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:08.694
Defense Force Third Division,
which successfully subdued the kaiju

00:06:08.778 --> 00:06:10.946
that suddenly appeared in the streets
of Yokohama.

00:06:11.655 --> 00:06:17.203
The leader of that division
is Officer Mina Ashiro-san.

00:06:17.286 --> 00:06:19.413
At the young age of 27,

00:06:19.497 --> 00:06:23.626
she not only became the captain
but has already defeated

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:25.503
{\an8}hundreds of kaiju.

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:26.629
‪SPECIAL FEATURE:
‪ZOOMING IN ON THE THIRD DIVISION

00:06:26.712 --> 00:06:29.256
Let's defeat all the kaiju together!

00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:35.971
CAPTAIN MINA ASHIRO

00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:38.474
Her calm and dignified disposition

00:06:38.557 --> 00:06:42.144
makes her one of the most popular captains
of the entire Defense Force.

00:06:42.228 --> 00:06:45.189
She's rumored to be the next
potential Division Commander.

00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:47.650
She's definitely an up-and-coming star.

00:06:56.784 --> 00:07:00.412
Why am I over here?

00:07:01.497 --> 00:07:03.707
Don't think about it!

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:07.920
Cleaning is important work
that also helps people!

00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:11.048
I have a nice room

00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:13.008
and can eat whatever I want.

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:16.554
That's enough, isn't it?

00:07:24.186 --> 00:07:26.188
My head hurts.

00:07:26.272 --> 00:07:28.607
It's definitely that TV show's fault!

00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:32.903
{\an8}‪MONSTER SWEEPER INC.

00:07:36.448 --> 00:07:37.491
Good morning.

00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:40.619
Kafka's here! Come this way!

00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:43.706
-I'm going to start getting ready!
-All right.

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:45.624
-Morning, Kafka.
-Hey.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:50.045
This is Ichikawa-kun. He'll work
with us part-time, starting today.

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:52.631
{\an8}His dream is to join the Defense Force!

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.011
That was his dream too, you know?

00:07:57.094 --> 00:08:00.556
He's already given up,
and he's a veteran here!

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.558
This is the worst!

00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:03.976
Toku-san,

00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:06.770
-how's he supposed to react to that?
-Why...

00:08:08.564 --> 00:08:10.816
Why did you give up?

00:08:15.446 --> 00:08:18.866
I tried my best, you know?

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:21.327
But there are so many talented people.

00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:25.331
I hit a wall to my potential.

00:08:25.414 --> 00:08:28.459
-You'll understand when you're older...
-I won't.

00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:33.714
I'll never give up.
I'll never understand until the day I die.

00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:36.091
Not that I want to.

00:08:36.175 --> 00:08:38.802
-Hey, where are you...
-I'm getting changed.

00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:41.764
Geez.

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:45.142
I thought you two would get along well.

00:08:45.226 --> 00:08:46.727
That's unfair!

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.898
No matter how I respond to that,
I'd be a pathetic loser!

00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:55.361
Is it such a bad thing to give up?

00:08:59.865 --> 00:09:01.951
All right, let's start.

00:09:02.034 --> 00:09:05.037
Team Miike, continue cleaning the bones.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.580
Keep everything intact

00:09:06.664 --> 00:09:08.165
-and send it over to Izumo Tech.
-Yes, sir!

00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:11.669
Team Yoshimura will dismantle the legs.
Everything will be discarded.

00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:13.003
Yes, sir.

00:09:13.087 --> 00:09:14.880
The newbies get the intestines.
Come with me.

00:09:14.964 --> 00:09:15.798
Yes, sir.

00:09:15.881 --> 00:09:17.883
All right! Serves you right!

00:09:17.967 --> 00:09:20.761
-Kafka, you're intestines, too.
-Me too?

00:09:21.345 --> 00:09:25.015
-This is my second day in a row!
-You're good at it though.

00:09:25.849 --> 00:09:29.019
Dammit, bring it on!

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:33.732
He always stands up
to the challenge in the end.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.487
If he had passed, he would've been
a great Defense Force member.

00:09:42.116 --> 00:09:43.701
Seriously?

00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:48.831
He's suffering big time!

00:09:52.001 --> 00:09:53.502
Same goes for me.

00:09:54.837 --> 00:09:59.383
Hey, is that all you brought to eat?

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.760
I don't think I can eat this.

00:10:02.678 --> 00:10:03.846
I'm sure.

00:10:04.847 --> 00:10:06.849
-Here.
-What is it...

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:08.851
Ow!

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:12.855
{\an8}That's for you.
Eat whatever you're able to.

00:10:12.938 --> 00:10:14.648
You have to get through the day.

00:10:14.732 --> 00:10:17.693
-I'll be fine...
-I'll give you these also.

00:10:17.776 --> 00:10:19.486
These make it much more tolerable.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.740
I don't know what you're saying,

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:24.742
but I seriously don't need those...

00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:28.203
Don't be shy. Just put them on.

00:10:28.287 --> 00:10:30.331
Senpai, that's workplace harassment!

00:10:30.414 --> 00:10:32.708
This is a rite of passage for all newbies.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.520
Carry your own stuff, okay?

00:10:54.104 --> 00:10:56.106
-Good work today!
-Good work!

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.611
-See you!
-Good work today.

00:11:03.197 --> 00:11:06.700
We got through the smelliest areas.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.418
Senpai.

00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:19.213
Hey, Ichikawa.

00:11:19.296 --> 00:11:23.217
Are you here to get back at me for lunch?

00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:25.385
Thanks to you...

00:11:25.928 --> 00:11:27.888
Thanks to you, I survived my first day.

00:11:30.349 --> 00:11:31.892
Thank you, sir.

00:11:36.814 --> 00:11:38.649
That's all.

00:11:39.858 --> 00:11:40.859
Goodbye.

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:48.826
Also, they're raising the age limit
to under 33.

00:11:49.493 --> 00:11:51.078
To join the Defense Force.

00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:55.165
Because of the low birthrates.

00:11:55.874 --> 00:11:58.877
It's your life,
so, it's none of my business,

00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:02.464
but when you said you gave up,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.759
you looked really sad, that's all.

00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:09.888
It seriously doesn't matter to me.

00:12:09.972 --> 00:12:14.017
If I got it all wrong, you're free
to give up all you want.

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:15.102
Bye!

00:12:16.478 --> 00:12:17.646
Ichikawa.

00:12:20.232 --> 00:12:21.733
Thanks.

00:12:21.817 --> 00:12:24.987
You're nicer than you look.

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:28.073
I told you that's not what this is about!

00:12:37.249 --> 00:12:38.125
Senpai?

00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:46.967
Yoju?

00:12:50.429 --> 00:12:54.224
Run, Ichikawa! Get as far away as you can!

00:12:55.392 --> 00:12:57.561
Once you're in a safe area, make a report.

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:00.480
-But senpai, you'd be alone...
-Having two won't make a difference!

00:13:01.398 --> 00:13:02.900
You're joining the Force, right?

00:13:03.609 --> 00:13:06.153
Don't die here!

00:13:18.081 --> 00:13:19.875
Here! I'm over here!

00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:49.154
Over there!

00:13:56.912 --> 00:13:58.121
I did it.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.957
Now, I can...

00:14:03.835 --> 00:14:06.004
Goddammit!

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:27.067
It's all gone.
Your home, my home, our school.

00:14:28.652 --> 00:14:30.862
I won't forgive kaiju!

00:14:30.946 --> 00:14:33.490
I was almost done
with all the GlaMon stages!

00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:35.867
That's why you're sad?

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.754
I'm sad that Meeko died.

00:14:49.047 --> 00:14:51.717
Meeko's your calico cat, right?

00:15:08.483 --> 00:15:11.069
-I'm going to join the Defense Force.
-I'm going to join the Defense Force.

00:15:12.988 --> 00:15:15.616
Hey, you're just a kid!

00:15:15.699 --> 00:15:17.868
You're still in elementary school too,
Kafka-kun!

00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:25.584
In that case,

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:29.087
let's bet on who becomes
the coolest Defense Force officer!

00:15:29.838 --> 00:15:32.341
Let's defeat all the kaiju together!

00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:37.346
Shit. It wasn't supposed to be like this!

00:15:42.434 --> 00:15:44.311
Shit!

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.275
Kaiju don't scare me!

00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:56.948
Aim for the leg. The leg...

00:16:02.371 --> 00:16:04.581
How did I get here?

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:08.001
Let's bet on who becomes
the coolest officer!

00:16:37.948 --> 00:16:39.324
Ichikawa?

00:16:41.618 --> 00:16:44.746
-You idiot! Why...
-I made the report!

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.040
That's not what I'm talking about!

00:16:49.835 --> 00:16:52.295
If I leave you here and run,

00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:56.883
I'd never become a Defense Force officer!

00:16:57.968 --> 00:16:59.261
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU...

00:17:01.763 --> 00:17:02.931
Shit.

00:17:03.014 --> 00:17:05.183
TOTSUKA CONSTRUCTION

00:17:06.101 --> 00:17:07.227
Shit.

00:17:09.563 --> 00:17:10.480
Shit!

00:17:11.815 --> 00:17:14.192
Why am I so weak?

00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:16.319
I haven't grown at all.

00:17:17.195 --> 00:17:20.198
I can't even protect my own video game,
a friend's cat,

00:17:20.282 --> 00:17:23.160
even my own kohai!

00:17:25.287 --> 00:17:27.497
Shit!

00:17:42.846 --> 00:17:45.682
Target defeated.
I see an injured civilian.

00:17:47.434 --> 00:17:48.769
Rescue operation will continue.

00:17:50.103 --> 00:17:52.814
{\an8}Igarashi, Takaragi,
look after the injured.

00:17:52.898 --> 00:17:53.732
{\an8}JAPAN DEFENSE FORCE THIRD DIVISION

00:17:53.815 --> 00:17:56.026
Everyone else, follow me.

00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:57.986
We'll look for any remaining yoju.

00:18:03.575 --> 00:18:06.745
-Are you all right?
-Don't move. Stay still.

00:18:35.899 --> 00:18:37.776
Mina is so cool.

00:18:38.693 --> 00:18:41.571
She crushed that frightening monster
with one blow.

00:18:44.407 --> 00:18:47.869
She's somewhere far away from me now.

00:18:49.454 --> 00:18:50.705
Senpai.

00:18:55.627 --> 00:18:57.295
After the kaiju appeared

00:18:58.129 --> 00:18:59.881
and you told me to run,

00:19:00.674 --> 00:19:03.677
if you didn't save me then,

00:19:04.803 --> 00:19:06.972
I would've died today.

00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:10.517
You were really cool.

00:19:12.894 --> 00:19:16.314
Let's bet on who becomes
the coolest Defense Force officer!

00:19:18.692 --> 00:19:21.361
I really think you should be
a Defense Force officer.

00:19:23.613 --> 00:19:27.409
Well, it's your life, so it doesn't
matter to me.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.538
You're right.

00:19:32.747 --> 00:19:37.043
When will I stop looking away
from what's important!?

00:19:39.462 --> 00:19:41.548
Thanks, Ichikawa.

00:19:43.133 --> 00:19:46.052
You're a really good guy.

00:19:46.803 --> 00:19:49.514
I don't think it's a bad thing to give up,

00:19:51.141 --> 00:19:53.727
but it's bad to lie to yourself!

00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:57.647
I'm going to try joining
the Defense Force again...

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.991
What?

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.577
I found you.

00:20:11.286 --> 00:20:13.371
Kai... Kai...

00:20:15.498 --> 00:20:16.666
Senpai?

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.589
Does your injury hurt?

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.343
Senpai!

00:20:43.151 --> 00:20:44.069
What?

00:20:44.152 --> 00:20:46.655
-What?
-Ichikawa, it's me!

00:20:48.031 --> 00:20:49.616
Don't get so scared!

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.914
OH...

00:20:55.997 --> 00:20:57.290
He's reporting you.

00:20:57.374 --> 00:20:59.167
Let's run, senpai!

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.379
What?

00:21:07.676 --> 00:21:10.470

00:22:40.268 --> 00:22:41.895
When you encounter a kaiju,

00:22:42.479 --> 00:22:44.147
you should attack its legs,

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.817
tie it up, and make sure it can't move.

00:22:49.569 --> 00:22:50.820
It's a little scary.

00:22:51.488 --> 00:22:52.447
What is?

00:22:53.198 --> 00:22:57.327
Imagining what it's like to fight a kaiju
that's so much bigger than you.

00:23:01.831 --> 00:23:03.249
It'll be okay.

00:23:05.084 --> 00:23:06.753
Anytime that happens,

00:23:09.297 --> 00:23:11.132
I'll be right next to you!

00:23:15.678 --> 00:23:16.721
Liar.

00:23:22.268 --> 00:23:23.394
Yes.

00:23:24.729 --> 00:23:27.315
A kaiju appeared
at South Yokohama Hospital?

00:23:28.525 --> 00:23:29.442
Yes.

00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:33.655
No, there's no problem.

00:23:34.656 --> 00:23:36.449
I'll dispatch my officers right away.

00:23:37.408 --> 00:23:38.451
Yes, we'll kill it.
