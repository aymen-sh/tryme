<b>Bow chika, bow chika,
bow chika, do-bee-dah!</b>

00:46.250 --> 00:48.460
<b>How did you know?</b>

03:01.680 --> 03:02.800
<b>Who's there?!</b>

03:07.350 --> 03:08.640
<b>I win again.</b>

03:08.730 --> 03:10.520
<b>How'd you know I was there?</b>

03:10.940 --> 03:13.730
<b>Because I've got eyes
in the back of my head.</b>

03:13.810 --> 03:15.270
<b>No way!</b>

03:15.730 --> 03:17.400
<b>What's with the mask?</b>

03:17.480 --> 03:18.900
<b>It's an Oni!</b>

03:20.110 --> 03:22.030
<b>I heard they're demons from Japan!</b>

03:22.110 --> 03:25.160
<b>He got that as a gift from a friend.</b>

03:25.240 --> 03:26.950
<b>It was a souvenir from a trip...</b>

03:27.040 --> 03:29.410
<b>Honey! Your face is an absolute mess!</b>

03:29.500 --> 03:31.580
<b>Oni are real big baddies!</b>

03:31.620 --> 03:34.170
<b>Well, they might show up
thinking you're one of them</b>

03:34.250 --> 03:35.630
<b>if you keep on wearing that mask.</b>

03:35.710 --> 03:37.670
<b>Then beat them all up for me!</b>

03:38.510 --> 03:41.880
<b>But they're big baddies, right?
You think I can take 'em?</b>

03:43.090 --> 03:44.140
<b>It's okay!</b>

03:44.510 --> 03:46.640
<b>Because Mommy will take them out for you!</b>

03:46.930 --> 03:47.760
<b>Really?!</b>

03:47.850 --> 03:49.270
<b>You bet!</b>

03:49.350 --> 03:52.690
<b>Then I guess Daddy's gonna work
on fixing the motorcycle,</b>

03:52.770 --> 03:55.110
<b>so we can run away when Mommy
gets in over her head.</b>

03:55.190 --> 03:56.230
<b>Wanna help me?</b>

03:56.310 --> 03:56.980
<b>Yeah!</b>

03:57.070 --> 03:59.360
<b>No, I don't want you getting
your clothes dirty again.</b>

03:59.440 --> 04:02.200
<b>Come along. And make sure you're home
in time for dinner, honey.</b>

04:02.530 --> 04:04.280
<b>Hurry up! We don't have time for-</b>

04:04.360 --> 04:05.620
<b>BOO!</b>

04:05.870 --> 04:06.910
<b>Jeez!</b>

04:13.620 --> 04:15.250
<b>Now for our next story.</b>

04:15.540 --> 04:16.880
<b>The culprit of the brutal murder</b>

04:16.960 --> 04:21.970
<b>that happened in El Balkeen on
the 10th of this month is still at large.</b>

04:22.420 --> 04:24.380
<b>The victim's body was
lacerated multiple times</b>

04:24.470 --> 04:26.050
<b>with what appears to be a sharp object.</b>

04:26.140 --> 04:28.470
<b>Investigators said these injuries suggest</b>

04:28.560 --> 04:31.680
<b>there were at least
five perpetrators involved,</b>

04:31.770 --> 04:35.190
<b>and many are speculating the murder was
carried out by a criminal organization.</b>

04:35.440 --> 04:36.690
<b>However, the victim had</b>

04:36.770 --> 04:39.110
<b>-Honey... could it have been...
-no discernible ties to any organizations</b>

04:39.190 --> 04:41.150
<b>that may be responsible,
so the investigation</b>

04:41.230 --> 04:42.940
<b>-Maybe it's the Oni.
-is currently at a standstill.</b>

04:43.320 --> 04:45.450
<b>The Oni could do that!</b>

04:49.740 --> 04:51.700
<b>Okay. It's time for bed, son.</b>

04:51.790 --> 04:53.370
<b>But I'm not sleepy!</b>

04:53.460 --> 04:54.540
<b>No buts.</b>

04:54.620 --> 04:56.540
<b>I hate when you make that face, Daddy!</b>

04:56.620 --> 04:59.290
<b>Well, even your mom
is saying that it's past your bedtime.</b>

05:01.420 --> 05:03.630
<b>I love every face that Mommy makes!</b>

05:03.880 --> 05:07.220
<b>You better behave or you won't
be getting a birthday present!</b>

05:22.730 --> 05:24.190
<b>What's wrong?</b>

05:26.320 --> 05:28.030
<b>It's that news from earlier.</b>

05:28.110 --> 05:30.450
<b>You know, the way he was killed...</b>

05:31.280 --> 05:32.580
<b>Mari...</b>

05:33.750 --> 05:36.120
<b>Not to mention the victim.</b>

05:36.210 --> 05:39.130
<b>They have zero insight into his
personal life even after interviewing</b>

05:39.210 --> 05:41.960
<b>a bunch of the people he worked with.</b>

05:42.050 --> 05:44.260
<b>Nothing out of the ordinary
about that these days.</b>

05:44.710 --> 05:47.300
<b>Everything's fine.
Nobody will get us out here.</b>

05:48.090 --> 05:50.930
<b>But... what about the Reaper?</b>

05:51.010 --> 05:52.890
<b>Even the Reaper.</b>

05:52.970 --> 05:55.350
<b>Besides, this definitely wasn't his work.</b>

05:55.680 --> 05:58.350
<b>You know he always worked alone.</b>

05:58.770 --> 06:02.440
<b>Relax, it's smooth sailing for us
from here on out.</b>

06:03.020 --> 06:04.030
<b>Right...</b>

07:09.220 --> 07:11.430
<b>Another horrific murder has occurred,</b>

07:11.510 --> 07:14.430
<b>this time in a quiet
residential area of St. Marks.</b>

07:14.510 --> 07:16.430
<b>The M.O. of the crime matches
that of the case in High Park</b>

07:16.510 --> 07:17.350
<b>on the 14th of last month,</b>

07:17.430 --> 07:23.860
<b>as well as in Oleana on the 26th, and also
in Zamilan on the 7th of this month.</b>

07:23.940 --> 07:28.320
<b>Authorities are currently saying that
we may have a serial killer on our hands.</b>

07:28.690 --> 07:31.740
<b>While a large-scale investigation
is now underway,</b>

07:31.820 --> 07:36.080
<b>things don't look too hopeful as there are
still no clues or connections that have</b>

<b>-That's the fourth one now...
-been established between the victims.</b>

07:49.920 --> 07:52.380
<b>Aw... It got burned all black again.</b>

07:52.470 --> 07:53.390
<b>Oops.</b>

07:53.970 --> 07:56.930
<b>Jeez! There goes your dad,
screwing things up yet again.</b>

07:57.010 --> 07:59.680
<b>That's why I said you
should let me handle it!</b>

08:00.020 --> 08:01.850
<b>Thicker cuts of meat can be
a challenge to grill</b>

08:01.940 --> 08:03.770
<b>while getting a good sear
on the outside...</b>

08:04.100 --> 08:06.480
<b>Happy birthday!</b>

08:06.560 --> 08:08.900
<b>To you!</b>

08:10.070 --> 08:12.860
<b>Wow! It's a Triger cake!</b>

08:12.950 --> 08:14.820
<b>Can you blow them all out?</b>

08:41.560 --> 08:42.850
<b>Oh boy, what is it?</b>

08:43.730 --> 08:44.980
<b>Hooray! Video games!</b>

08:45.060 --> 08:46.600
<b>And, a little bonus!</b>

08:48.230 --> 08:49.110
<b>Roar!</b>

08:49.190 --> 08:53.950
<b>You know, I like seeing you in this mask
way more than that scary Oni one.</b>

08:54.200 --> 08:56.740
<b>Yeah, I like being on the hero side too!</b>

08:57.370 --> 08:58.700
<b>Well, your mom...</b>

08:58.950 --> 09:00.950
<b>prefers seeing this face
more than anything.</b>

09:01.290 --> 09:06.000
<b>Looks like Mommy is using more dirty
tricks to get on your good side again!</b>

09:07.880 --> 09:09.290
<b>I love you.</b>

09:09.540 --> 09:11.250
<b>Both of you.</b>

09:14.170 --> 09:15.430
<b>Love you, too.</b>

09:30.690 --> 09:33.610
<b>Don't worry. Just stay put.</b>

10:13.070 --> 10:14.230
<b>Daddy!</b>

11:15.710 --> 11:18.130
<b>She put up quite the damn struggle.</b>

11:48.080 --> 11:49.660
<b>They got here too quick.</b>

11:49.750 --> 11:50.870
<b>Who ratted us out?</b>

13:16.710 --> 13:17.790
<b>Get the doctor!</b>

13:18.420 --> 13:19.590
<b>Hurry up!</b>

13:20.380 --> 13:22.840
<b>Are you okay? Can you hear me, sir?</b>

13:22.920 --> 13:24.010
<b>Mari...</b>

<b>Mr. Logan! Mr. Logan!</b>

13:39.900 --> 13:41.190
<b>Please remain calm.</b>

13:41.730 --> 13:44.490
<b>Do you understand what happened to you?</b>

13:46.990 --> 13:48.160
<b>You miraculously came back to life</b>

13:48.240 --> 13:49.990
<b>after literally being
on the very brink of death.</b>

13:50.080 --> 13:51.530
<b>What about my wife...</b>

13:51.620 --> 13:52.990
<b>and son?</b>

13:55.460 --> 13:56.920
<b>I'm afraid they didn't make it...</b>

14:03.510 --> 14:05.920
<b>It's been a whole day
since he was confirmed dead.</b>

14:06.720 --> 14:09.180
<b>Do you seriously think
this dude came back to life?</b>

14:09.470 --> 14:12.180
<b>Maybe he's not even human anymore.</b>

14:13.810 --> 14:14.680
<b>Great.</b>

14:15.980 --> 14:17.940
<b>Let's go meet, Mr. Zombie.</b>

14:21.520 --> 14:23.780
<b>Please don't agitate him too much.</b>

14:25.490 --> 14:27.070
<b>Of course.</b>

<b>Hello, Mr. Joe Logan.</b>

14:28.990 --> 14:31.070
<b>I'm Mike Morris with the FBI.</b>

<b>Pardon us for bothering you

<b>but we'd like your help

<b>Can you remember who attacked your family?</b>

<b>Any ideas or thoughts as
to what their motives were?</b>

<b>Anything would help us.</b>

<b>Please feel free to contact me

15:04.860 --> 15:06.070
<b>That guy...</b>

15:07.110 --> 15:08.950
<b>probably knows who did this.</b>

15:09.030 --> 15:09.950
<b>Huh?</b>

15:10.450 --> 15:12.160
<b>It's just a hunch.</b>

15:14.120 --> 15:16.450
<b>But just in case, we'll take turns

15:18.410 --> 15:19.870
<b>Roger that...</b>

15:22.630 --> 15:23.790
<b>Yep.</b>

15:24.210 --> 15:26.460
<b>He's been up on the roof for awhile now.</b>

15:26.840 --> 15:29.920
<b>Okay, I won't make any moves on my own.</b>

15:30.220 --> 15:31.300
<b>Roger.</b>

15:40.140 --> 15:43.440
<b>Would you care to see

16:55.090 --> 16:57.180
<b>What the hell is going on?!</b>

18:09.080 --> 18:12.590
<b>Christ, why isn't she

18:15.220 --> 18:17.720
<b>H-holy crap. What the hell?</b>

18:30.110 --> 18:32.400
<b>Just couldn't die, could you?</b>

19:24.620 --> 19:27.660
<b>How exactly did you find us?</b>

19:28.790 --> 19:32.460
<b>Go ahead and change your appearance
