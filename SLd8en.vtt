WEBVTT

00:08.630 --> 00:10.060
I surrender!

00:11.100 --> 00:14.090
I surrender to you! So please spare my life!

00:15.300 --> 00:18.030
That voice... Are you...?

00:26.510 --> 00:29.780
I-I'm so sorry! You win!

00:29.780 --> 00:31.830
So please, don't kill me!

02:04.160 --> 02:07.010
You attack us and then beg for your life?

02:07.430 --> 02:09.940
And after the rest of your people 
are already dead.

02:10.290 --> 02:13.320
A knight's duty is to protect their lord,

02:13.320 --> 02:16.760
so as long as I live,
I'm sure they'd be happy.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.820
<i>They'd be happy?</i>

02:20.310 --> 02:21.250
Whatever.

02:27.750 --> 02:28.960
<i>Here's my chance!</i>

02:35.110 --> 02:36.390
What do you think you're doing?

02:36.790 --> 02:41.670
Spare my life, and you can 
have anything you want! Please!

02:41.670 --> 02:42.940
<i>This demon...</i>

02:44.110 --> 02:48.020
In that case, do you know where 
the entry permit for the next floor is?

02:48.020 --> 02:52.100
M-My family is actually holding onto it.

02:52.100 --> 02:55.300
Since you didn't kill me, I offer it gladly!

02:55.300 --> 02:58.960
I also know where all the rest 
for the upper floors are,

02:58.960 --> 03:03.450
so if you can guarantee my family's 
and my safety, I'll show you the way!

03:03.880 --> 03:06.170
So your family's been hiding it, huh?

03:06.560 --> 03:09.670
No wonder I couldn't seem to find it, 
no matter how many I killed.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.590
That leaves one last question.

03:13.550 --> 03:17.260
Can I really trust you?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.970
O-Of course.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.180
I-I'd never lie to you.

03:26.690 --> 03:30.670
Fine, then. If you hand over 
the permit, I won't hurt you.

03:31.980 --> 03:34.490
Th-Thank you so much.

03:35.550 --> 03:36.820
I'm curious.

03:37.490 --> 03:39.250
What exactly are you?

03:56.420 --> 03:59.430
I am the eldest daughter 
of the Radiru family, Esil.

03:59.430 --> 04:02.640
Not exactly what I meant.

04:04.330 --> 04:07.740
<i>I was hoping to get more 
information about the system</i>

04:07.740 --> 04:09.510
<i>like what I learned from Barca, but...</i>

04:10.860 --> 04:15.630
Do you demons hear a voice in your head 
that never stops telling you to kill humans?

04:18.410 --> 04:21.790
No, but I do hear a different order.

04:21.790 --> 04:22.700
What is it?

04:23.660 --> 04:25.660
"Protect the place you're in."

04:26.680 --> 04:27.620
When did it start?

04:27.620 --> 04:29.830
When we first got here.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.460
<i>When they first </i>got<i> here...?</i>

04:32.180 --> 04:33.620
Where were you before that?

04:33.620 --> 04:38.310
The demon realm. But then one day, 
we found ourselves here.

04:39.030 --> 04:42.010
And what were you doing in the demon realm?

04:44.950 --> 04:45.930
War.

04:47.030 --> 04:49.390
We were preparing for war.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.100
<i>War?</i>

04:51.100 --> 04:52.200
With whom?

04:53.280 --> 04:57.650
An enemy so strong that we had to 
unite all of demonkind to face it.

04:58.110 --> 05:01.470
It looked like war with them 
was on the horizon when—

05:03.450 --> 05:07.360
The permitted amount of information has been 
exceeded, so this conversation is terminated.

05:07.360 --> 05:11.380
The permitted amount of information has been 
exceeded, so this conversation is terminated.

05:11.380 --> 05:12.170
The permitted...

05:17.280 --> 05:19.420
<i>I guess I'm not getting anything else.</i>

05:22.130 --> 05:25.670
This is the damage assessment and combat log

05:25.670 --> 05:29.930
of the winged ant appearance on the 
nearby island within Japan's borders.

05:30.630 --> 05:36.680
There were 294 civilian casualties,
and 108 hunters deployed to contain the threat.

05:36.680 --> 05:41.650
Of the latter, four E-Ranks, one C-Rank, 
and one B-Rank have been KIA.

05:42.860 --> 05:45.620
All this from a single ant...

05:46.050 --> 05:51.540
An A-Rank hunter who arrived later landed 
a critical blow, completing the extermination.

05:51.540 --> 05:55.290
Then one of these winged ants 
is on par with an A-Rank.

05:55.800 --> 06:00.550
That matches the conclusions drawn 
from the Surveillance Team's necropsy.

06:03.400 --> 06:07.550
The attack was 120 kilometers from Jeju Island.

06:08.230 --> 06:14.060
If the ants gain any further mastery 
over flight, they could reach the mainland.

06:14.990 --> 06:17.550
Contact Japan to request 
a joint operation ASAP.

06:18.070 --> 06:21.870
Let other neighboring countries know 
to raise the threat level, as well.

06:21.870 --> 06:22.870
Yes, sir.

06:22.870 --> 06:26.530
The time has finally come. 
We've not a moment to spare.

06:26.530 --> 06:30.940
I was hoping to handle this before 
any more lives were lost, but...

06:31.840 --> 06:35.980
On my authority as chairman of the 
Hunter's Association, I hereby initiate...

06:35.980 --> 06:39.420
the fourth raid operation on Jeju Island!

06:41.310 --> 06:43.010
I'm sorry.

06:43.010 --> 06:46.430
I don't know why I suddenly 
passed out like that.

06:46.430 --> 06:48.620
No, it's fine.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.890
Do you feel all right now?

06:50.890 --> 06:53.110
Yes, I'm okay.

06:53.110 --> 06:55.610
I appreciate your concern...

06:55.610 --> 06:57.310
Just thought I'd ask.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.530
More importantly, 
are we close to our destination?

07:02.150 --> 07:05.400
Oh, right! The Radiru family castle.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.440
That's where the permit can be found.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.290
What in the blazes have you brought home?!

07:11.290 --> 07:12.670
Esil!

07:13.250 --> 07:15.410
C-Can't you see them?!

07:15.410 --> 07:18.920
The hordes of soldiers 
dwelling within his shadow!

07:19.290 --> 07:21.880
<i>Huh. I'm impressed he noticed.</i>

07:21.880 --> 07:25.350
If you've deceived my daughter 
in some attempt to seize our castle,

07:25.350 --> 07:26.970
I won't let you leave alive!

07:26.970 --> 07:29.800
F-Father! Please wait!

07:29.800 --> 07:32.240
She and I have a deal.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.520
I won't hurt anybody as long as 
I get the permit I need to proceed.

07:37.810 --> 07:41.190
<i>I had heard that Vulcan and Metus 
had been slain...</i>

07:41.190 --> 07:45.450
<i>I suppose it stands to reason we'd stand 
no chance against someone capable of that.</i>

07:56.260 --> 07:58.070
This is it, all right.

07:58.670 --> 08:01.760
I believe your business here is complete.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.500
Now, begone at once!

08:03.500 --> 08:04.960
One other thing.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.420
I need to borrow the girl.

08:09.430 --> 08:11.510
Y-You—

08:11.510 --> 08:14.430
No, hang on. I just want her 
to show me the way.

08:14.430 --> 08:17.800
She said she knows where the permits 
I need to move from floor to floor are.

08:19.060 --> 08:21.060
And you'll guarantee her safety?

08:21.060 --> 08:22.080
I will.

08:25.020 --> 08:27.690
Very well. I understand.

08:27.690 --> 08:30.800
That being the case, 
I'm counting on you, Esil.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.950
Right!

08:44.340 --> 08:45.500
Guildmaster.

08:56.090 --> 08:59.230
And that wraps up the 89th floor.

09:01.100 --> 09:04.110
Igris and Tank have both ranked up 
from the levels they gained.

09:05.730 --> 09:08.540
They're comparable to an 
S-Rank and A-Rank now.

09:08.540 --> 09:10.640
That rounds out my forces nicely.

09:13.910 --> 09:19.050
So much for the gifts I brought 
from home for trade...

09:19.050 --> 09:20.910
You can always just take them back home.

09:20.910 --> 09:22.800
I'm afraid not.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.090
The 90th floor and above are under 
the stewardship of elite nobles.

09:26.580 --> 09:29.550
They're incomparably stronger 
than anything up to this point.

09:30.010 --> 09:33.360
Which is why it'd be wiser to secure 
the permits through negotiation—

09:33.360 --> 09:37.760
If I were weaker than you guys, would you 
have agreed to make a deal with me?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.730
That's just how it goes.

09:41.150 --> 09:44.810
You demon nobles are always jockeying 
for positions in the hierarchy, right?

09:44.810 --> 09:48.570
I'm about to put the Radisu family 
on the top of the ladder.

09:48.940 --> 09:50.920
It's Radiru, actually...

09:50.920 --> 09:56.530
Um, Sir Jinwoo, why did you 
choose to spare my family?

09:56.980 --> 09:58.740
Because I like you.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.950
E-Excuse me?!

10:01.330 --> 10:02.950
<i>Between her and Jinho...</i>

10:03.380 --> 10:07.670
<i>I think I might work well with people 
who have a screw loose.</i>

10:08.220 --> 10:10.050
You can head back now.

10:12.580 --> 10:15.340
The enemies up ahead 
are gonna be stronger, right?

10:15.620 --> 10:17.540
I made a promise with your father.

10:17.540 --> 10:21.680
Just tell me where to find the permits, 
and I'll take it from there.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.400
Am I really so... useless?

10:25.400 --> 10:28.760
It's not that. 
I just thought it'd be dangerous.

10:28.760 --> 10:31.100
You've done great. I appreciate it.

10:32.150 --> 10:34.570
I'm going to accompany you to the end.

10:34.570 --> 10:38.430
I want to see with my own eyes 
what you'll accomplish, Sir Jinwoo!

10:40.040 --> 10:41.500
Okay.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.780
Let's get going, then.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.210
Right.

10:48.840 --> 10:53.050
<i>Esil was right. The difficulty level hit 
a genuine spike with the 90th floor.</i>

10:53.750 --> 10:56.580
<i>Each encampment of magic beasts, 
in both strength and numbers,</i>

10:56.580 --> 10:58.930
<i>is quite literally on a different level.</i>

10:59.430 --> 11:03.560
<i>But I'm continuing apace, 
clearing the floors one step at a time.</i>

11:05.110 --> 11:10.420
<i>I need to collect the ingredients 
for the Elixir of Life, no matter what.</i>

11:14.280 --> 11:19.160
You and I have been summoned for the 
fourth Jeju Island raid, Hunter Cha.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.160
Yes, sir.

11:20.160 --> 11:23.950
President Baek from the White Tiger Guild 
has also been called upon,

11:23.950 --> 11:27.820
along with every other S-Rank 
hunter in the country.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.670
<i>Then Hunter Sung, too...</i>

11:30.670 --> 11:32.350
In addition,

11:32.350 --> 11:36.630
this will officially be a joint operation 
between us and our close neighbor.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.590
You mean Japan?

11:38.590 --> 11:39.840
Exactly.

11:39.840 --> 11:44.850
Considering the winged ants' ability 
to fly, they're at risk, as well.

11:44.850 --> 11:46.660
It's the right call to make.

11:48.070 --> 11:52.570
<i>I honestly don't care, 
as long as we can kill them all.</i>

11:53.430 --> 11:55.030
Is there a date set?

11:55.290 --> 11:56.730
Still under consideration.

11:56.730 --> 11:59.410
But I doubt we'll be waiting long.

11:59.830 --> 12:03.410
And in order to decide upon a plan of action,

12:03.410 --> 12:07.730
hunters from their largest guild 
will be joining us today.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.710
So this is the top floor.

12:14.090 --> 12:16.420
No one seems to be around, though...

12:31.300 --> 12:34.070
So this is the Demon Monarch...

12:35.030 --> 12:36.160
Baran.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.030
<i>What incredible aura.</i>

12:46.030 --> 12:48.080
<i>Can I really beat him?</i>

12:48.660 --> 12:51.060
<i>His sheer bloodlust is wearing me down...</i>

12:51.790 --> 12:54.020
<i>Even Esil is feeling it.</i>

12:54.830 --> 12:57.920
<i>Well, I'm in for real trouble 
if he gets airborne.</i>

12:58.920 --> 13:01.800
<i>A wyvern? I guess he commands 
more than just demons.</i>

13:26.990 --> 13:28.570
There's no shortage of them.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.160
Wh-What do we do?!

13:33.380 --> 13:34.330
Sir Jinwoo!

13:34.620 --> 13:35.790
I know!

13:38.800 --> 13:40.060
Get out here!

14:00.190 --> 14:04.450
Incredible! I had no idea 
he could fight like that.

14:05.350 --> 14:08.180
<i>But... that's the Demon Monarch, Baran.</i>

14:08.180 --> 14:09.450
<i>He is the ruler here,</i>

14:09.830 --> 14:13.920
<i>and Sir Jinwoo is a simple invader—
a target for elimination.</i>

14:14.710 --> 14:18.420
<i>Who... should I side with?</i>

14:48.140 --> 14:50.010
<i>That's no ordinary lightning.</i>

14:50.010 --> 14:52.330
<i>It has a wide area of effect and inflicts stun.</i>

14:53.240 --> 14:55.370
<i>Even if my soldiers can be brought back,</i>

14:55.370 --> 14:58.470
<i>taking much more of this 
will deplete my mana fast.</i>

14:58.940 --> 15:00.550
<i>So before that happens...</i>

15:10.320 --> 15:11.890
<i>I'll clip those wings!</i>

15:13.430 --> 15:15.560
<i>He saw through my Stealth?!</i>

15:24.530 --> 15:26.220
<i>A homing attack?!</i>

15:26.220 --> 15:28.080
<i>Not good! It's gaining on me!</i>

15:28.080 --> 15:29.910
Tusk! Igris!

15:56.470 --> 15:58.330
You're finally grounded.

15:59.100 --> 16:03.070
That's a relief.
Looking up was tiring me out.

16:11.270 --> 16:15.950
It's nice to meet you. My name is Hanekawa, 
and I'm with the Drawn Sword Guild.

16:15.950 --> 16:18.550
This is Goto Ryuji, our guild master.

16:19.180 --> 16:22.500
I'll be acting as his interpreter.

16:22.790 --> 16:24.760
<i>The Drawn Sword Guild...</i>

16:24.760 --> 16:29.170
<i>As the largest guild in Japan, 
with eleven S-Ranks,</i>

16:29.530 --> 16:33.170
<i>they're also said to be the 
second biggest in all of Asia.</i>

16:33.170 --> 16:37.520
<i>And leading them is Guildmaster Goto Ryuji.</i>

16:37.520 --> 16:40.440
<i>His aura does not betray his reputation.</i>

16:41.160 --> 16:45.590
First, we'd like to thank you 
for inviting us to the joint operation

16:45.590 --> 16:47.210
and the mixed forces strike team.

16:47.210 --> 16:51.350
No, we should be thanking you 
for accepting our invitation.

16:51.350 --> 16:53.490
We are most grateful.

16:53.820 --> 16:55.890
As the documents you've received say,

16:55.890 --> 17:03.740
the investigation into the winged ants 
has revealed a fair bit of information.

17:04.470 --> 17:08.720
Two points within 
will be critical to this operation.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.220
One is their lifespan.

17:11.220 --> 17:16.180
The ants grow at an accelerated rate after 
hatching but only live for about a year.

17:16.180 --> 17:19.130
In other words, if we can kill the ant queen,

17:19.130 --> 17:22.400
the remaining numbers will 
die off in about a year.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.800
The other is regarding their behavior.

17:25.800 --> 17:30.580
From the previous three raids, we know that 
the ants are drawn to stronger enemies—

17:30.580 --> 17:34.370
those with greater magic power.

17:34.370 --> 17:39.010
We're going to plan the operation 
around that and use it against them.

17:39.650 --> 17:43.560
<i>We'd been aware of the ants' tendencies.</i>

17:43.560 --> 17:46.890
<i>But this is quite the elaborate breakdown.</i>

17:47.930 --> 17:49.850
Regarding the plan...

17:49.850 --> 17:56.890
Of the Drawn Sword Guild's eleven S-Ranks, 
ten will be participating, including myself.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.770
Ten of the full eleven?

18:00.090 --> 18:02.560
We'll draw the ants out.

18:02.560 --> 18:06.560
We'd like your team to take out 
the ant queen while that happens.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.670
That would involve you fighting 
thousands of ants...

18:10.150 --> 18:13.430
If we only need to cause a distraction, 
it should be fine.

18:13.430 --> 18:18.160
AI simulations have shown that this plan 
has the best chance of succeeding.

18:18.830 --> 18:23.520
<i>Ten S-Rank hunters is certainly more 
than we would be able to field.</i>

18:23.520 --> 18:25.000
<i>In that case...</i>

18:25.000 --> 18:30.470
Very well. We'll head into tactical planning 
under that broader strategy.

18:39.150 --> 18:41.600
<i>I don't even have time 
to restore my mana with potions.</i>

19:01.040 --> 19:02.790
<i>Fatal Strike was blocked?!</i>

19:32.440 --> 19:34.190
<i>There goes the last of my mana.</i>

20:17.900 --> 20:19.490
Damn it! My dagger!

20:30.090 --> 20:31.950
<i>He's so strong!</i>

20:33.460 --> 20:34.590
<i>Are you kidding me?!</i>

20:36.340 --> 20:37.260
<i>I can't dodge—</i>

20:43.810 --> 20:44.800
This is it!

20:44.800 --> 20:46.810
<i>It's time to put all my investment in strength</i>

20:46.810 --> 20:49.140
<i>and Ruler's Hand to use!</i>

21:05.910 --> 21:09.330
You're done!

21:22.940 --> 21:24.230
Sir Jinwoo?

21:45.660 --> 21:46.910
Sir Jinwoo!

21:47.250 --> 21:50.410
Esil... Head home and tell your dad...

21:51.210 --> 21:54.920
From now on, the Radisu family 
runs things around here.

21:55.590 --> 21:57.050
Sir Jinwoo...

22:00.650 --> 22:04.030
It's Radiru, not Radisu.
