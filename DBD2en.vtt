<b>I'm Mister Satan.</b>

<b>Buu!</b>

05:18.100 --> 05:21.690
<b>My goodness! I've grown young!</b>

05:21.820 --> 05:24.030
<b>Look. Isn't our skin so smooth?!</b>

05:24.150 --> 05:26.200
<b>You're right!</b>

05:29.320 --> 05:33.410
<b>Everyone looks younger, but I guess
they're the same on the inside?</b>

05:34.040 --> 05:37.920
<b>We haven't so much grown young
as become tiny.</b>

05:39.170 --> 05:41.210
<b>You've always been tiny!</b>

05:42.590 --> 05:44.920
<b>As if I didn't know that.</b>

<b>Whoa! Even Vegeta's all cute now!</b>

05:50.390 --> 05:52.180
<b>What's going on?</b>

05:52.310 --> 05:56.180
<b>It must have something to do with

<b>I, the world's ultra super hero,

<b>I sensed an unpleasant presence
at the temple.</b>

06:07.530 --> 06:08.740
<b>Okay! I'll go check it out!</b>

06:08.860 --> 06:10.030
<b>Whoa!</b>

06:16.200 --> 06:17.540
<b>Hot! Hot!</b>

06:19.880 --> 06:24.210
<b>Because you shrank so suddenly, you aren't
used to the balance of your body yet.</b>

06:25.670 --> 06:26.920
<b>Who are you?</b>

06:27.840 --> 06:29.260
<b>I'm Master Roshi.</b>

06:30.930 --> 06:32.850
<b>You're Old Kamesennin!</b>

06:33.760 --> 06:38.100
<b>I guess I don't look so old anymore, do I?</b>

06:40.770 --> 06:44.400
<b>You can call me Big Kamesennin instead.</b>

06:47.110 --> 06:51.200
<b>Kibito will take us to the temple.
Come with us.</b>

06:52.990 --> 06:54.580
<b>Hold it. I'm coming, too.</b>

07:02.750 --> 07:04.340
<b>Oh. Hi there.</b>

07:04.960 --> 07:06.800
<b>This ain't the time for "Hi there."</b>

07:08.260 --> 07:10.880
<b>Huh? Wait, where's Dende?!</b>

07:11.510 --> 07:13.600
<b>Some strange men took him away.</b>

07:16.430 --> 07:17.640
<b>What strange men?!</b>

07:18.270 --> 07:22.150
<b>They had pointy ears and said
they came from the Demon Realm.</b>

07:22.900 --> 07:24.400
<b>The Demon Realm?</b>

07:26.730 --> 07:28.530
<b>The Demon Realm?!</b>

07:34.700 --> 07:35.990
<b>That's...</b>

07:39.540 --> 07:43.000
<b>One of them looked like you,
Supreme Kai-sama.</b>

07:44.670 --> 07:45.790
<b>What did you say?!</b>

07:46.420 --> 07:48.090
<b>They called him "Degesu."</b>

07:48.760 --> 07:50.010
<b>Degesu...!</b>

07:50.590 --> 07:52.220
<b>So it was Degesu.</b>

07:52.340 --> 07:53.680
<b>Someone you know?</b>

07:54.760 --> 07:56.810
<b>He's Supreme Kai-sama's younger brother.</b>

07:57.720 --> 07:59.470
<b>You've got a brother?!</b>

08:00.600 --> 08:01.600
<b>Yes.</b>

08:01.730 --> 08:04.600
<b>And there was a short arrogant guy,</b>

08:04.730 --> 08:07.110
<b>and an old Namek called Neva.</b>

08:07.230 --> 08:08.480
<b>Did you say "Neva"?!</b>

08:09.570 --> 08:10.690
<b>Who's that?</b>

08:11.610 --> 08:16.410
<b>Long ago, he was the Legendary Namek
who remained in the Demon Realm alone</b>

08:16.530 --> 08:18.540
<b>to protect the Demon Realm Dragon Balls.</b>

08:20.250 --> 08:24.500
<b>So that Namek controlled
the Earth Dragon Balls?</b>

08:24.620 --> 08:28.000
<b>He was feeble, but he had great power.</b>

08:29.300 --> 08:35.140
<b>And the short arrogant guy asked Shenron
to turn all of us into children.</b>

08:36.390 --> 08:37.970
<b>Then let's go after them!</b>

08:38.890 --> 08:40.350
<b>We gotta save Dende!</b>

08:40.470 --> 08:44.890
<b>We can't. There's no way
to teleport to the Demon Realm.</b>

08:45.600 --> 08:47.150
<b>Then what do we do?</b>

08:50.360 --> 08:53.110
<b>We might have something we can use.</b>

08:53.950 --> 08:58.160
<b>Kibito, return to the Supreme Kai World
and bring back the spaceship.</b>

08:58.740 --> 09:00.030
<b>Understood.</b>

09:08.790 --> 09:09.790
<b>Well done.</b>

09:10.500 --> 09:11.960
<b>I have returned.</b>

09:13.010 --> 09:16.970
<b>Long ago, I came to this universe
in this spaceship.</b>

09:19.890 --> 09:21.680
<b>I don't know if it still works.</b>

09:29.980 --> 09:31.320
<b>It's no good.</b>

09:32.150 --> 09:33.900
<b>It looks like it won't turn on.</b>

09:35.150 --> 09:37.910
<b>I've neglected it for so long, so...</b>

09:38.030 --> 09:41.200
<b>In that case, we can get Bulma to fix it.</b>

09:41.330 --> 09:43.540
<b>She's a genius!</b>

09:43.660 --> 09:45.660
<b>I'll go get her!</b>

09:55.170 --> 09:57.180
<b>Phew! That was close!</b>

09:59.720 --> 10:02.140
<b>Get used to the balance of
your smaller body.</b>

10:02.760 --> 10:04.310
<b>Are you used to yours?</b>

10:12.320 --> 10:14.530
<b>Looks like you're the same, too.</b>

10:23.540 --> 10:24.790
<b>I've brought them.</b>

10:24.910 --> 10:27.540
<b>Vegeta! You're here, too!</b>

10:27.660 --> 10:28.620
<b>Of course I am!</b>

10:29.620 --> 10:32.250
<b>I can't let anyone get away with
turning me into a brat!</b>

10:33.340 --> 10:34.630
<b>Where's baby Trunks?</b>

10:35.510 --> 10:38.510
<b>I left him with a babysitter so he's fine.</b>

10:39.180 --> 10:40.340
<b>I heard what's going on.</b>

10:41.090 --> 10:43.050
<b>So this is the spaceship?</b>

10:43.760 --> 10:45.100
<b>What is this?</b>

10:45.720 --> 10:47.810
<b>This thing is practically junk.</b>

10:47.930 --> 10:50.850
<b>And it looks like
it's been beaten up recently.</b>

10:51.690 --> 10:55.730
<b><i>That happened when Goku and Vegeta fought
Majin Buu in the Supreme Kai world.</i></b>

10:56.690 --> 10:58.360
<b>This spaceship...</b>

10:59.450 --> 11:02.070
<b>It has a pretty interesting structure.</b>

11:03.200 --> 11:06.200
<b>A normal spaceship wouldn't be able to
get to the Demon Realm.</b>

11:06.790 --> 11:09.790
<b>I'll fix it,
but it'll take about ten days.</b>

11:09.910 --> 11:11.710
<b>That long?!</b>

11:11.830 --> 11:14.590
<b>We need to hurry or they'll kill Dende!</b>

11:14.710 --> 11:16.380
<b>We don't have a choice.</b>

11:16.500 --> 11:19.220
<b>I believe Dende-san will be all right.</b>

11:19.340 --> 11:23.930
<b>They kidnapped him without killing him,
so they must have plans for him.</b>

11:24.720 --> 11:25.810
<b>Okay.</b>

11:26.930 --> 11:31.140
<b>I'll need a garage, machines,
and helper robots.</b>

11:31.270 --> 11:35.980
<b>I'll bring them as capsules, so
could you take me back home, Kibito-san?</b>

11:38.940 --> 11:40.700
<b>I... understand.</b>

11:41.280 --> 11:44.120
<b>TWO DAYS LATER</b>

11:49.620 --> 11:51.540
<b>How can we return to normal?</b>

12:00.880 --> 12:03.300
<b>I think I got the hang of flyin' now!</b>

12:03.430 --> 12:05.180
<b>Sure. Whatever.</b>

12:11.390 --> 12:14.730
<b>What the heck? I couldn't reach.</b>

12:22.490 --> 12:23.740
<b>Huh?</b>

12:23.860 --> 12:28.330
<b>Still can't. Turnin' small
made my sense of distance all screwy.</b>

12:34.920 --> 12:36.330
<b>Be quiet, Kakarot!</b>

12:37.340 --> 12:38.800
<b>Sorry, sorry.</b>

12:40.760 --> 12:44.760
<b>At this rate it'll take too long
to get used to this size.</b>

12:46.430 --> 12:47.720
<b>That's it!</b>

12:48.350 --> 12:51.980
<b>I gotta go somewhere! I'll be right back!</b>

12:53.140 --> 12:55.770
<b>Tch. He's so obnoxious.</b>

12:57.110 --> 13:01.940
<b>So is everyone with pointy ears
from the Demon Realm?</b>

13:02.650 --> 13:04.650
<b>Not everyone.</b>

13:05.280 --> 13:08.320
<b>But you can assume that most are.</b>

13:08.450 --> 13:13.910
<b>Long ago, some sought freedom,
some went out to rule other planets...</b>

13:14.040 --> 13:15.330
<b>Traveling became a thing,</b>

13:15.460 --> 13:19.710
<b>and there was time when many Majin
slipped out of the Demon Realm.</b>

13:19.840 --> 13:22.670
<b>Eventually it was forbidden.</b>

13:23.590 --> 13:24.380
<b>And now...</b>

13:25.010 --> 13:29.800
<b>only those who are granted permission
can travel to and from the Demon Realm.</b>

13:36.060 --> 13:37.520
<b>There we go!</b>

13:38.520 --> 13:40.610
<b>-Hey, Kibito-san.
-What?</b>

13:40.730 --> 13:45.780
<b>I ordered takeout for dinner,
so could you teleport and go get it?</b>

13:45.900 --> 13:46.700
<b>Thank you!</b>

13:49.780 --> 13:51.200
<b>Hey!</b>

13:53.120 --> 13:54.700
<b>Huh?!</b>

13:54.830 --> 13:57.040
<b>Ah. There you are.</b>

13:57.750 --> 13:59.540
<b>Karin-sama!</b>

13:59.670 --> 14:01.340
<b>It's been a long time.</b>

14:02.000 --> 14:05.090
<b>You ain't surprised I've shrunk at all?</b>

14:05.210 --> 14:07.760
<b>There's no need to explain.</b>

14:07.880 --> 14:12.310
<b>I sometimes look at
the Surface World below from here.</b>

14:12.430 --> 14:14.930
<b>Huh. You've got a lotta free time.</b>

14:15.060 --> 14:16.180
<b>Pretty much.</b>

14:16.310 --> 14:20.150
<b>More importantly, Karin-sama,
I'm here for my Nyoibo.</b>

14:20.770 --> 14:21.770
<b>Hm?</b>

14:23.070 --> 14:25.230
<b>See? It's not in there.</b>

14:26.190 --> 14:28.280
<b><i>It was here, remember?</i></b>

14:28.400 --> 14:34.200
<b>Nobody really uses it
to go to the Palace anymore.</b>

14:34.330 --> 14:35.750
<b>Then where is it?</b>

14:35.870 --> 14:39.120
<b>Hmm... Where was it?</b>

14:40.380 --> 14:45.880
<b>Ah, that's right.
I had Master Roshi hold onto it.</b>

14:46.010 --> 14:47.670
<b>With Master Roshi, huh?!</b>

14:47.800 --> 14:49.220
<b>Thanks!</b>

14:50.300 --> 14:53.300
<b>Maybe you should take your Flying Nimbus!</b>

14:53.430 --> 14:55.640
<b>I'll be fine!</b>

14:58.350 --> 15:01.650
<b>He's always in such a rush.</b>

15:07.820 --> 15:09.450
<b>Hey, Master!</b>

15:11.410 --> 15:13.120
<b>Ah. Goku.</b>

15:14.780 --> 15:16.040
<b>What're you doin'?</b>

15:16.660 --> 15:22.000
<b>Now that I'm young again,
there's a lot of things I want to do.</b>

15:22.130 --> 15:23.460
<b>Hmm.</b>

15:24.210 --> 15:25.920
<b>So, how can I help you?</b>

15:26.880 --> 15:31.680
<b>Know where my Nyoibo is?
Karin-sama said you have it.</b>

15:32.300 --> 15:33.470
<b>Your Nyoibo?</b>

15:34.100 --> 15:36.930
<b>Hmm. Did I have it?</b>

15:37.560 --> 15:41.310
<b>What? He said that it was here.</b>

15:41.940 --> 15:44.310
<b>Did you put it away somewhere?</b>

15:45.060 --> 15:46.520
<b>I can't recall.</b>

15:46.650 --> 15:50.530
<b>Don't be like that.
You gotta remember, Master!</b>

15:53.490 --> 15:54.410
<b>Hey!</b>

15:55.740 --> 15:57.540
<b>Welcome back, Son-kun.</b>

15:58.540 --> 16:00.370
<b>Lemme show you somethin' cool.</b>

16:01.370 --> 16:03.000
<b>Ta-daa!</b>

16:14.220 --> 16:15.800
<b>Extend!</b>

16:21.100 --> 16:22.140
<b>Return!</b>

16:24.730 --> 16:25.730
<b>What do you think?</b>

16:26.360 --> 16:27.440
<b>That's your Nyoibo.</b>

16:28.070 --> 16:29.980

16:30.110 --> 16:32.150
<b>Yeah. Where did you find it?</b>

16:32.860 --> 16:34.610
<b><i>Master Roshi used it for laundry.</i></b>

16:38.620 --> 16:40.040
<b>Oh! Looks delish!</b>

16:41.000 --> 16:42.250
<b>Everybody dig in.</b>

16:42.370 --> 16:44.250
<b>Let's eat!</b>

16:51.590 --> 16:53.130
<b>Now that I think about it,</b>

16:53.260 --> 16:57.010
<b>it would have been easier
if Kibito-san brought the spaceship</b>

16:57.140 --> 16:58.510
<b>back to Capsule Corporation.</b>

17:01.060 --> 17:04.390
<b>I think you're mistaking me
for some kind of delivery boy.</b>

17:04.520 --> 17:07.650
<b>Hey, Piccolo. Do you remember
the Demon Realm at all?</b>

17:08.270 --> 17:11.360
<b>No. I wasn't born back then.</b>

17:11.980 --> 17:14.320
<b>But I've heard about it.</b>

17:14.450 --> 17:16.410
<b>What sort of place is it?</b>

17:16.530 --> 17:20.830
<b>The place where Nameks lived
was nice, apparently.</b>

17:21.580 --> 17:24.160
<b>Huh. Then why did they escape?</b>

17:25.410 --> 17:29.130
<b>Nameks don't like to be ruled.</b>

17:30.590 --> 17:31.670
<b>Hm?</b>

17:34.470 --> 17:35.260
<b>What's that?!</b>

17:38.800 --> 17:39.600
<b>An enemy?!</b>

17:39.720 --> 17:42.850
<b>I don't know.
I don't sense any strong malice.</b>

17:43.890 --> 17:47.480
<b>But my senses may have dulled
from becoming a child.</b>

17:47.600 --> 17:49.940
<b>And after I got a feast for us!</b>

17:50.060 --> 17:51.190
<b>Here it comes.</b>

18:03.910 --> 18:05.830
<b>Oh! That's the spaceship!</b>

18:06.580 --> 18:09.000
<b>The one the Demon Realm folks used!</b>

18:09.130 --> 18:09.920
<b>What?!</b>

18:11.090 --> 18:13.880
<b>Oh. But it's a different color.</b>

18:15.170 --> 18:16.840
<b>It could still be one of them.</b>

18:34.440 --> 18:35.280
<b>Excuse me.</b>

18:41.820 --> 18:44.160
<b>Who are you?</b>

18:44.870 --> 18:46.870
<b>I am Glorio.</b>

18:49.620 --> 18:51.290
<b>You're from the Demon Realm.</b>

18:51.420 --> 18:53.500
<b>Yes. That's right.</b>

18:55.630 --> 18:58.800
<b>You're... Goku, right?</b>

18:59.930 --> 19:01.510
<b>That's right.</b>

19:02.600 --> 19:03.760
<b>I have a request.</b>

19:05.640 --> 19:09.980
<b>Come with me to the Demon Realm
and defeat King Gomah.</b>

19:10.100 --> 19:11.440
<b>Huh?!</b>

19:11.560 --> 19:13.650
<b>What?! Gomah?!</b>

19:13.770 --> 19:17.190
<b>Who the heck's that King whatever?</b>

19:18.110 --> 19:22.910
<b>An evil Majin who became king
after Supreme Demon King Dabura's death.</b>

19:23.530 --> 19:24.990
<b>Now it makes sense.</b>

19:25.700 --> 19:29.120
<b>The short arrogant man
who kidnapped Dende-san.</b>

19:30.330 --> 19:31.620
<b><i>It was Gomah.</i></b>

19:32.290 --> 19:33.460
<b>Who is he?</b>

19:34.130 --> 19:35.960
<b>A Majin who cannot be underestimated.</b>

19:36.750 --> 19:40.420
<b>He's very powerful, but also very crafty.</b>

19:41.050 --> 19:42.260
<b>Yes.</b>

19:43.300 --> 19:45.470
<b>Well then, that's perfect.</b>

19:46.260 --> 19:48.930
<b>Let's go. Let's go rescue Dende.</b>

19:52.400 --> 19:57.270
<b>Wait a minute!
How did you know about Goku-san?</b>

19:57.940 --> 20:00.070
<b>I heard from the king of
the Third Demon World.</b>

20:00.650 --> 20:04.530
<b>He watched your battle with Majin Buu
through a Magic Monitor.</b>

20:05.450 --> 20:08.370
<b>I was ordered by the king to come here.</b>

20:08.990 --> 20:12.580
<b>So you serve the king of
the Third Demon World?</b>

20:13.460 --> 20:19.300
<b>No. I was given the request in secret
to come get you.</b>

20:19.920 --> 20:21.220
<b>I see.</b>

20:22.630 --> 20:25.640
<b>Very well. Then I shall go with you, too.</b>

20:25.760 --> 20:26.550
<b>Huh?</b>

20:27.180 --> 20:28.720
<b>You, Supreme Kai-sama?!</b>

20:28.850 --> 20:33.350
<b>It appears that
my brother is involved as well.</b>

20:33.480 --> 20:37.230
<b>And I do possess some knowledge
about the Demon Realm.</b>

20:37.360 --> 20:39.150
<b>Then let's go.</b>

20:39.820 --> 20:41.110
<b>Hold on a minute!</b>

20:42.700 --> 20:44.570
<b>Can I examine your spaceship?</b>

20:44.700 --> 20:48.080
<b>I'd like to use it as reference
for our repairs.</b>

20:48.950 --> 20:50.200
<b>Spaceship?</b>

20:50.830 --> 20:54.000
<b>Ah, you mean my plane.</b>

20:54.620 --> 20:56.960
<b>If it goes to space then it's a spaceship.</b>

20:57.590 --> 21:00.590
<b>It just happened to fly
through space this time.</b>

21:00.710 --> 21:02.010
<b>It doesn't normally.</b>

21:02.130 --> 21:02.920
<b>Hmm.</b>

21:03.550 --> 21:05.510
<b>You're free to do so, but please hurry.</b>

21:09.560 --> 21:11.310
<b>That Glorio fellow...</b>

21:11.930 --> 21:14.770
<b>Don't let your guard down to him.</b>

21:14.890 --> 21:16.310
<b>Huh? How come?</b>

21:16.940 --> 21:20.900
<b>He shouldn't have known
that we were turned into children,</b>

21:21.030 --> 21:22.320
<b>but he wasn't surprised.</b>

21:22.940 --> 21:26.280
<b>Maybe he heard about it
from that king of his.</b>

21:26.990 --> 21:29.070
<b>Let's hope that's the case.</b>

21:29.870 --> 21:31.620
<b>I see.</b>

21:32.240 --> 21:35.330
<b>Thanks. It's impressive,
but I think I understand how it works.</b>

21:36.120 --> 21:39.420
<b>I should complete my repairs
sooner than expected.</b>

21:40.040 --> 21:40.880
<b>Okay!</b>

21:41.000 --> 21:42.590
<b>Now let's get goin'!</b>

21:44.470 --> 21:45.970
<b>I'm going, too.</b>

21:46.090 --> 21:50.680
<b>Until we deal with that king
and restore our Dragon Balls,</b>

21:50.810 --> 21:52.350
<b>we'll be children forever.</b>

21:53.470 --> 21:56.850
<b>You can't.
This plane only carries three people.</b>

21:57.480 --> 22:02.440
<b>What?! We're child-sized,
so one more can squeeze in!</b>

22:02.570 --> 22:04.320
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

22:04.440 --> 22:08.320
<b>You can join us after Bulma-san finishes
repairing the spaceship.</b>

22:09.820 --> 22:10.780
<b>Tch...</b>

22:20.580 --> 22:23.050
<b>Catch you all later then!</b>

22:41.690 --> 22:43.570
<b><i>Holding out my hand</i></b>

22:45.360 --> 22:47.280
<b><i>Up to the sky</i></b>

22:49.150 --> 22:51.660
<b><i>The moment is ours</i></b>

22:52.320 --> 22:55.700
<b><i>Make a miracle happen</i></b>

22:55.830 --> 23:01.960
<b><i>Like a bird with open wings we fly</i></b>

23:02.080 --> 23:05.800
<b><i>Picking up</i></b>

23:05.920 --> 23:09.170
<b><i>Those pieces of hope</i></b>

23:10.260 --> 23:16.180
<b><i>There's no giving up</i></b>

23:16.770 --> 23:20.980
<b><i>Go as far as we can</i></b>

23:21.100 --> 23:24.610
<b><i>I got you by my side</i></b>

23:24.730 --> 23:27.690
<b><i>Run, run, run</i></b>

23:27.820 --> 23:31.280
<b><i>Over the mountain we go</i></b>

23:31.410 --> 23:35.120
<b><i>I hear it always
Your voice in my heart</i></b>

23:35.240 --> 23:39.580
<b><i>"You know that we're never alone" </i></b>

23:40.620 --> 23:45.500
<b>DAIMA</b>
