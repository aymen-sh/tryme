WEBVTT

00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:07.108
It's already a known fact.

00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:10.236
You're not so good at enhancing
your own power, Star.

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:13.114
New Order.

00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:16.492
At first glance, it seems
like a Quirk with limitless abilities.

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:19.161
But there was a limit
to boosting its power.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.873
No matter what rules I imposed on it,
nothing worked out.

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:25.793
People who knew me well would say,

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:29.839
"A Quirk is mostly
about what you possess inside.

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:32.675
I wonder if it's
because you're a girl, Cassie."

00:00:34.343 --> 00:00:38.264
"Because you're a girl"?
That has nothing to do with it, Star.

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.559
That's just the nature of your Quirk.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:44.478
Use us to make up for what you lack.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.900
-That's how we support each other.
-Although you're more than strong enough,

00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:53.112
you're disappointed because
you're comparing yourself to All Might.

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:57.533
But she's also the only one who has a shot
at getting close to his level.

00:00:57.617 --> 00:00:59.243
They're both gorillas after all.

00:00:59.327 --> 00:01:00.828
Hey, watch it!

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:05.333
Star.

00:01:07.418 --> 00:01:10.296
Basically, we're telling you not to worry.

00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:14.759
Those words that I hated...

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.055
They never once said them to me.

00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:26.729
{\an8}ORIGINAL STORY BY KOHEI HORIKOSHI

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.316
Star! Tiamat is headed our way!

00:02:55.317 --> 00:02:57.278
The trajectory of the hypersonic missiles,

00:02:57.903 --> 00:02:58.904
can you touch them?

00:02:58.988 --> 00:03:03.534
Yes. But I have
to release the rule imposed on the laser.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:05.786
Cover for me by launching a barrage.

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:09.540
The moment we let up,
he'll launch an attack.

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:14.545
She must be aware that these attacks
won't work on me.

00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:17.798
She's preventing me from regenerating

00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:19.925
by detaining me with this laser attack.

00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:27.475
Basically, if she can't pulverize me
in a single blow, all of this is useless.

00:03:27.558 --> 00:03:29.602
Ms. Star is aware of that.

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:32.229
She must be waiting for something.

00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:37.735
It must be something with more firepower
than what she's using right now.

00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:42.448
Okay, Star! We'll prevent
Tomura's hyper-regeneration

00:03:42.531 --> 00:03:45.910
and use maximum firepower to strike him
without any hesitation!

00:03:46.577 --> 00:03:49.121
It can't be... No... It's possible.

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:50.414
In that case...

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:53.626
Then this is the win or lose moment
for the both of us.

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.212
This is basically

00:03:56.295 --> 00:03:58.881
a shitty game of push and pull.

00:03:59.882 --> 00:04:01.092
Start counting!

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:03.052
Three, two,

00:04:03.636 --> 00:04:04.553
One.

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:13.938
Before this blows off the lower half
of my arm...

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.397
New Order.

00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:17.066
"Tiamat

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:19.568
will pivot!"

00:04:20.444 --> 00:04:23.739
As long as I impose a rule on one missile...

00:04:25.407 --> 00:04:26.408
Fire.

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:31.497
State-of-the-Art Hypersonic

00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:35.209
Intercontinental Cruise Punch!

00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:41.257
How did it go?

00:04:47.513 --> 00:04:48.430
That's...

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.353
Did we get him?

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.361
I can control

00:05:03.112 --> 00:05:04.905
my power of Decay.

00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:08.534
I knew she had something up her sleeve.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.413
I learned from our battle so far

00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:16.041
that New Order can only impose a rule
on two targets at the same time.

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:20.129
If she was to impose a new rule,
the situation would have to change.

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:21.672
So, the moment that

00:05:22.548 --> 00:05:24.633
the rules changed,

00:05:24.717 --> 00:05:26.886
I used Decay to dive underground

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:28.971
and let her proceed
with her planned attack.

00:05:29.054 --> 00:05:32.683
If I dove underground too early,
she would've changed her tactic.

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:36.186
I barely made it out alive.
I took a gamble!

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:39.899
If I hadn't used Nomu as a decoy,

00:05:39.982 --> 00:05:42.234
and if I was even a second late,

00:05:42.318 --> 00:05:44.403
it would've been fatal.

00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:47.573
He used Nomu as a decoy.

00:05:47.656 --> 00:05:52.328
You already knew that this was
a shitty game of push and pull.

00:05:52.912 --> 00:05:54.455
If you weren't up against me,

00:05:54.538 --> 00:05:56.498
you could've lived your life

00:05:56.582 --> 00:05:59.126
without making excuses
for your weak offense!

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:01.879
Support Star! Return to formation!

00:06:02.546 --> 00:06:03.631
Give her a place to land!

00:06:03.714 --> 00:06:05.341
I won't let that happen!

00:06:06.091 --> 00:06:07.801
Burst!

00:06:15.601 --> 00:06:18.312
Give me your Quirk!

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.067
I will make better use of it!

00:06:26.695 --> 00:06:30.491
Do it, Star! Crush this aircraft
together with Tomura!

00:06:30.574 --> 00:06:34.745
The explosion of the aircraft
will blow him to pieces!

00:06:35.537 --> 00:06:38.540
No, he's regenerating too fast.

00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:39.917
Star!

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:01.939
In the first place, what I really dreaded

00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:07.027
was the coalition
between New Order and One For All.

00:07:07.987 --> 00:07:11.615
So I put a stop
to the Hero Public Safety Commission

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:16.578
and had my friends overseas
wreak bountiful havoc

00:07:16.662 --> 00:07:22.167
so it would delay foreign heroes
from coming to Japan's aid.

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:26.422
My plan was to complete my new body,

00:07:26.505 --> 00:07:30.134
steal One For All, and after that,

00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:33.178
I was going to go up against you
to steal New Order.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.685
One For All, the crystallization of power
that will bring everything to naught...

00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:43.272
Once that is mine,

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.903
then all the coalitions in this world,
including New Order, would be like ants.

00:07:51.864 --> 00:07:56.327
I'm not sure if you were aware of this,
but your independent decision to come here

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.205
created the worst possible scenario
for me.

00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:06.420
I had to take a gamble
with this incomplete body of mine.

00:08:07.546 --> 00:08:08.839
But this gamble...

00:08:10.132 --> 00:08:14.720
I won this gamble, America!

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:18.974
Cathleen Bate will not decay!

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.438
She protected me...

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.358
You fool!

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:30.277
I completely agree!

00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:33.822
It won't work.

00:08:33.906 --> 00:08:36.700
It goes beyond the limit of my durability.

00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:40.245
I can't stop the Decay.

00:08:41.497 --> 00:08:42.748
It's mine!

00:08:44.249 --> 00:08:48.587
Your body will decay
as your Quirk is drawn out.

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:54.259
Since New Order is a power
that activates by stating a rule,

00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:59.348
you cannot simultaneously protect
your Quirk and your body.

00:09:00.891 --> 00:09:05.854
You chose to protect yourself,
but you ended up losing both.

00:09:07.022 --> 00:09:10.359
{\an8}This is where it's all
going to begin, Yoichi.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.863
Those comics that we read
together that day...

00:09:15.739 --> 00:09:19.910
I knew that there was
more to those stories.

00:09:21.453 --> 00:09:22.496
New Order!

00:09:23.622 --> 00:09:25.165
I knew how the story would go,

00:09:25.749 --> 00:09:28.293
and that's why I stopped reading it.

00:09:28.377 --> 00:09:29.378
"The air..."

00:09:54.945 --> 00:09:58.323
What's happening? Tomura is falling apart.

00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:03.871
What's happening? My Quirks are exploding!

00:10:04.455 --> 00:10:06.832
Don't tell me... Star...

00:10:07.499 --> 00:10:08.333
Yes...

00:10:08.834 --> 00:10:11.587
Blowing him up together with
the aircraft wouldn't have been enough,

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.549
so I imposed a new rule
right before Tomura Shigaraki caught me.

00:10:16.675 --> 00:10:18.552
"New Order

00:10:20.554 --> 00:10:24.600
will resist other Quirks!"

00:10:34.443 --> 00:10:37.738
Cathleen Bate!

00:10:38.572 --> 00:10:43.577
The worst-case scenario was to lose
my Quirk and die.

00:10:44.495 --> 00:10:47.456
It would've been great
if I was able to come out of this alive,

00:10:47.998 --> 00:10:50.209
but that was just a bonus.

00:10:51.627 --> 00:10:53.587
If all it takes is my life

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:57.633
in exchange to stop
this evil being threatening the world,

00:10:58.884 --> 00:11:00.636
it's a small price to pay.

00:11:03.138 --> 00:11:06.642
Thank you everything, Bros.

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:09.478
Commander Agpar,

00:11:10.395 --> 00:11:11.897
I'm sorry for always...

00:11:13.315 --> 00:11:14.733
being so unreasonable.

00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:16.985
Star!

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:19.988
Star!

00:11:22.824 --> 00:11:25.244
My Quirks are resisting each other!

00:11:25.327 --> 00:11:28.580
It's as if they're cannibals.
This is not good.

00:11:29.414 --> 00:11:33.835
I can steal or give away Quirks,
but I can't discard them.

00:11:35.254 --> 00:11:37.172
I have to give New Order to someone else.

00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:40.384
The pilots! I'll give it to them!

00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:43.387
Fire!

00:11:45.514 --> 00:11:46.765
Bombard him!

00:11:46.848 --> 00:11:50.519
Star is continuing her fight
inside of him!

00:11:54.231 --> 00:11:57.693
My Reflect Quirk has been destroyed.

00:11:58.277 --> 00:12:00.195
It's working! He's getting weaker!

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:04.700
Keep hitting him with the laser!
Don't let Star's sacrifice go to waste!

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:10.289
My Quirks are being destroyed
one after another...

00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:12.749
by New Order!

00:12:22.426 --> 00:12:23.635
Because...

00:12:25.887 --> 00:12:29.182
you saved me back then...

00:12:31.977 --> 00:12:36.356
I was able to bask in this lovely dream.

00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:39.985
That's why,

00:12:40.944 --> 00:12:42.070
All Might...

00:12:44.573 --> 00:12:46.199
I am now

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:49.828
returning the favor.

00:12:58.253 --> 00:13:01.048
This is not good. I need to hurry.

00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:02.507
Dammit,

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.888
you specter of All Might!

00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:11.725
Don't let him get away! Take him down!

00:13:12.642 --> 00:13:17.189
I took the Wing Quirk from my lovely Nomu
before it exploded.

00:13:17.773 --> 00:13:21.693
If I add power to these wings,
I can escape!

00:13:22.694 --> 00:13:27.074
I have to find someone!
I have to pass New Order onto someone!

00:13:28.617 --> 00:13:31.203
Otherwise, it will destroy me!

00:13:32.162 --> 00:13:35.665
I have eight tufts of hair!

00:13:36.541 --> 00:13:39.503
It's you once again.

00:13:40.587 --> 00:13:44.508
No matter what, in the end,
it's always you,

00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:46.885
All Might!

00:13:49.054 --> 00:13:50.347
Dammit!

00:13:51.306 --> 00:13:52.265
Dammit!

00:13:58.188 --> 00:13:59.898
Star.

00:14:01.024 --> 00:14:04.194
Starting today, you'll be working with me.

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:06.905
Let's risk our lives together, Brothers!

00:14:08.698 --> 00:14:13.203
I am now returning the favor.

00:14:15.914 --> 00:14:16.832
Star.

00:14:17.874 --> 00:14:20.127
Star and Stripe.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.088
You had already surpassed him.

00:14:24.506 --> 00:14:26.091
You were always...

00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:31.847
the most awesome hero.

00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:43.608
There's nothing on TV.
None of the channels are working.

00:14:43.692 --> 00:14:47.154
It can't be helped. The TV staff
all had to evacuate and take refuge.

00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:50.407
The water and electricity still work here.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.286
The distribution system is down,
but we still have the basics.

00:14:56.788 --> 00:14:57.831
{\an8}ROBBER AND MURDERER
KASHIKO KASHI

00:14:57.914 --> 00:15:00.250
{\an8}I finally got out of prison.

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:03.128
{\an8}Only idiots would wreak havoc in the city.

00:15:03.795 --> 00:15:06.506
The smarter ones start a second life
in the countryside.

00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:12.095
What the hell?

00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:20.187
-A hero... no, it doesn't seem like it...
-A ghost?

00:15:20.937 --> 00:15:25.150
There's still a possibility...

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:29.905
The rule that Ms. Star
imposed on her Quirk

00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:33.658
is most likely a rule that prevents
it from dwelling with other Quirks.

00:15:34.451 --> 00:15:36.036
In that case,

00:15:36.787 --> 00:15:40.081
I will steal a Quirk from this person,
make him Quirkless,

00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:43.335
and give him New Order.
Then I can store it inside him!

00:15:43.418 --> 00:15:44.836
Idiot.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.802
New Order will repel other Quirks.

00:15:52.511 --> 00:15:56.014
Thankfully, you possess lots of Quirks,

00:15:56.681 --> 00:15:59.851
so New Order will also be repelled
and eventually disappear.

00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:03.980
It's a shame I couldn't kill you,

00:16:04.648 --> 00:16:07.984
but remember this, John Doe.

00:16:08.777 --> 00:16:11.446
As long as people
continue saving each other,

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.408
someone who has inherited
the will of a hero

00:16:15.492 --> 00:16:18.245
will without a doubt destroy you.

00:16:20.163 --> 00:16:21.623
Whatever.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.710
The one who survives the longest
is the winner.

00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:29.548
Go away, you dead person.

00:16:34.928 --> 00:16:37.556
Someone... who's a hero...

00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:41.977
Midoriya.

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:52.195
After Shigaraki escaped,
a search was immediately launched.

00:16:53.029 --> 00:16:55.949
All that was found
were signs of a struggle,

00:16:56.741 --> 00:16:59.160
and nothing pointed
to Shigaraki's whereabouts.

00:17:00.871 --> 00:17:06.376
The news about the death of America's
number one hero spread worldwide that day.

00:17:08.086 --> 00:17:11.715
The fact that the strongest hero
of the current generation was defeated,

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:13.884
caused all countries to shrink in fear.

00:17:15.427 --> 00:17:18.555
I'm not being dispatched?
We're abandoning Japan?

00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:21.683
No, we're choosing not to abandon
our own country, Salaam.

00:17:22.267 --> 00:17:23.602
The loss of heroes

00:17:24.269 --> 00:17:26.146
leads to the destruction of a country.

00:17:26.897 --> 00:17:30.358
Therefore, heroes are needed to protect
their own countries

00:17:30.442 --> 00:17:33.111
instead of helping others
in faraway lands.

00:17:33.194 --> 00:17:34.070
{\an8}POLICE STATION

00:17:34.154 --> 00:17:38.116
{\an8}All countries immediately decided
to stop dispatching heroes.

00:17:41.411 --> 00:17:42.746
Cassie...

00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:44.831
I wanted to see you.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.668
But Star's death will not go to waste.

00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:52.297
The X-66 that we were riding

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.467
recorded footage of the battle
between Star and Tomura Shigaraki.

00:17:56.259 --> 00:17:59.304
All his biological responses
during the battle

00:17:59.387 --> 00:18:01.181
and Quirk analysis were recorded.

00:18:01.723 --> 00:18:05.727
I'm sure you can get some clues
by researching this.

00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:11.024
I'm confident all of you have already been
conducting research on that monster.

00:18:12.317 --> 00:18:14.778
And the next day...

00:18:15.362 --> 00:18:16.571
A delay?

00:18:17.364 --> 00:18:21.159
We discovered this thanks to the footage
obtained from the American fighter jet.

00:18:21.993 --> 00:18:26.039
Originally, Shigaraki's body
should've been completed by tomorrow.

00:18:26.831 --> 00:18:30.001
But now, Shigaraki will be immobile
for at least a week.

00:18:30.585 --> 00:18:34.422
It's the gift of time that Star and Stripe
left behind for us.

00:18:35.423 --> 00:18:37.592
Star bought us time.

00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:43.098
After Shigaraki stole New Order,
it corroded him like a poison.

00:18:44.307 --> 00:18:46.601
How many Quirks he possesses is unclear,

00:18:46.685 --> 00:18:49.813
but it's believed that a good number
of his Quirks have been destroyed.

00:18:51.189 --> 00:18:54.401
-Then now is the...
-Best time to take him down.

00:18:54.484 --> 00:18:57.779
That's right.
We will use this time wisely.

00:18:58.363 --> 00:19:00.657
We will take down
Shigaraki and All For One.

00:19:01.616 --> 00:19:04.411
While the work of evacuating civilians
is still ongoing,

00:19:04.494 --> 00:19:08.623
remaining heroes are searching
for Shigaraki and the rest.

00:19:09.207 --> 00:19:12.627
But what will All For One do now that
he has suffered a setback?

00:19:13.253 --> 00:19:15.005
It's harder than ever to guess.

00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:20.468
Whether we find him or not,
it will end in an all-out battle.

00:19:22.012 --> 00:19:23.805
Although he may be immobile,

00:19:23.888 --> 00:19:27.183
Tomura Shigaraki is still
a super strong villain.

00:19:27.892 --> 00:19:30.395
And there's also the body of All For One.

00:19:31.187 --> 00:19:34.983
Dabi, the madman, with flames
that rivals Endeavor.

00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:38.737
The constant troublemaker, Himiko Toga.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.740
The remaining six Near High-Ends.

00:19:42.699 --> 00:19:46.995
The remnants of the Liberation Front.
And the escaped convicts

00:19:47.078 --> 00:19:50.123
who continue to follow All For One
and wreak havoc.

00:19:50.915 --> 00:19:53.626
-There must be more.
-Yes.

00:19:54.335 --> 00:19:55.670
The number of them will only increase.

00:19:56.379 --> 00:20:01.342
In contrast, we have lost many
who have been fighting at the frontline.

00:20:02.218 --> 00:20:05.138
I will say this knowing
that Star just died in line of duty...

00:20:05.889 --> 00:20:10.351
In order to protect yourselves
and everything you consider dear,

00:20:10.435 --> 00:20:14.689
I want you all to use this time
we've been given to power up.

00:20:14.773 --> 00:20:16.691
We've already been doing just that!

00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:21.571
All Might, you weren't aware
because you left school with Deku.

00:20:21.654 --> 00:20:23.907
Even when you're here,
you leave soon after.

00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:26.409
Ever since the Gunga and Jaku incident,

00:20:27.077 --> 00:20:31.790
we've continued to do what we can
and have trained hard with the Pussycats.

00:20:32.457 --> 00:20:35.126
We will go with Midoriya.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.338
We intend to fight
until we stop Shigaraki and the rest.

00:20:38.421 --> 00:20:39.589
That's our intent!

00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:44.511
Kacchan and the rest have offered to spar
with me in order to complete One For All...

00:20:44.594 --> 00:20:46.638
I never said such a thing!

00:20:46.721 --> 00:20:48.348
Did the prison escapees take your ears?

00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:50.058
Why haven't you changed?

00:20:50.767 --> 00:20:54.979
I want to test my new move Cluster
and see how well it works in a battle.

00:20:55.688 --> 00:21:00.610
Fighting One For All will be one way
to gauge the fight against All For One.

00:21:01.277 --> 00:21:02.320
You're right.

00:21:02.987 --> 00:21:05.031
You can beat me up too!

00:21:05.115 --> 00:21:07.325
You want your role to be
as the punching bag, huh?

00:21:07.992 --> 00:21:10.662
I need to harden myself even more!

00:21:10.745 --> 00:21:13.123
We have to carry on Star's mission!

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:14.791
My Star was...

00:21:14.874 --> 00:21:16.209
She was everyone's Star.

00:21:17.252 --> 00:21:19.045
Let's begin,

00:21:19.921 --> 00:21:21.548
you zygotes!

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.677
They were like eggs back then,

00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:28.596
but they have long since hatched.

00:21:29.305 --> 00:21:31.182
They remain undaunted against storms.

00:21:31.266 --> 00:21:33.768
And now, they are preparing
to spread their wings.

00:21:36.437 --> 00:21:41.484
All For One, as I've said before,
you have made a foolish mistake.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.195
Let me say it once again.

00:21:44.988 --> 00:21:48.408
This class is very strong!

00:23:20.667 --> 00:23:24.212
Preview of the next episode.
In preparation for the impending battle,

00:23:24.295 --> 00:23:26.965
we are training to power up our Quirks.

00:23:27.548 --> 00:23:32.053
But the villain's evil influence
had long since reached UA,

00:23:32.136 --> 00:23:34.180
corroding it from within.

00:23:34.973 --> 00:23:38.434
Just a single involvement
with the atrocity,

00:23:38.518 --> 00:23:40.103
and there's no escape.

00:23:40.728 --> 00:23:42.605
Next episode, "Villain."

00:23:42.689 --> 00:23:45.692
The light of justice drowns in darkness.

00:23:46.693 --> 00:23:49.195
Go beyond. Plus Ultra.

00:23:49.278 --> 00:23:50.655
