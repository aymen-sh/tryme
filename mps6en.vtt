No, it can't be. If the one with
the blue cap really is the suspect,

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:12.503

her mom and his own wife.

- Let's go, then.
- Yes.

00:35:13.567 --> 00:35:16.957
How did I meet such a dangerous neighbor?

00:35:22.837 --> 00:35:25.917
You should be safe
once you leave this town,

00:35:25.917 --> 00:35:29.717
but just in case, call me as soon
as you arrive at your friend's house.

00:35:29.717 --> 00:35:32.997
- My phone number is...
- I know.

00:35:34.327 --> 00:35:37.717
You told me the day I arrived here.

00:35:37.717 --> 00:35:40.027
- Right.
- Yes.

00:35:44.577 --> 00:35:47.827
I know it doesn't make any sense, but

00:35:47.827 --> 00:35:54.507
you seem like someone who came
on purpose to save me, Mr. Yoon.

00:35:55.387 --> 00:35:58.587
As though you were waiting,
knowing I would be here.

00:35:58.587 --> 00:36:05.777
It seems like you were thinking for
a long time about how to rescue me.

00:36:05.777 --> 00:36:07.547
How could that be?

00:36:07.547 --> 00:36:09.187
Right?

00:36:09.187 --> 00:36:13.437
I know that couldn't be true,
but you helped me out like that.

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:15.397
Thank you.

00:36:16.197 --> 00:36:18.987
If it weren't for you, Mr. Yoon,

00:36:18.987 --> 00:36:22.327
I don't know where I would be right now.

00:36:24.037 --> 00:36:26.450
I'm truly grateful to you.

00:38:14.457 --> 00:38:16.217
You asshole.

00:38:16.217 --> 00:38:22.147
I saw you under the bridge that
day, daring to signal to the police

00:38:22.147 --> 00:38:25.627
secretly to help the protester.

00:38:25.627 --> 00:38:29.437
I thought you were just
an oblivious teacher, but

00:38:29.437 --> 00:38:31.677
now I see you were on the same team.

00:38:31.677 --> 00:38:33.347
Is that right?

about? I was just passing by.

perfectly normal person?

Shut up and follow me, you punk!

- W-Where?
- Gosh!

My kids are there in that house.

00:39:45.137 --> 00:39:49.027
What are you talking about? There
should only be two people there.

I should have picked them up last night.

00:39:54.947 --> 00:39:56.797

police to our school today, and

down. It's all his fault.

Joo Young leave safely

00:43:23.847 --> 00:43:26.217
became another variable.

00:43:26.217 --> 00:43:29.697
And that variable
created another situation.

I think I can figure it out.

- What do you mean?
- The one with the blue cap.

00:44:38.347 --> 00:44:42.887
This might have an answer.

00:44:54.437 --> 00:44:57.237
A novel isn't a report.

00:44:58.317 --> 00:45:03.807
Just because it was based on real events
doesn't mean she would write their real names.

00:45:03.807 --> 00:45:08.507
I didn't think Go Mi Sook's novel
mentioned anything about a blue cap.

00:45:08.507 --> 00:45:12.207
But then, there was a
similar character in her story.

00:45:12.907 --> 00:45:15.987
A man with blue hair.

00:45:15.987 --> 00:45:21.617
All this time I thought the "blue head"
in this story was talking about blue hair.

Do I need to share every
single thing that happens here?

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.287
Do you do that?

00:45:39.287 --> 00:45:42.747
Were we even close enough to do that?

00:45:51.657 --> 00:45:53.860
You know, don't you?

00:45:57.357 --> 00:45:59.397

00:46:00.727 --> 00:46:03.437
You're not even curious to find out.

00:46:05.747 --> 00:46:08.077
You found out who it is.

00:46:08.777 --> 00:46:11.637
You didn't lose him at the cafe last night.

00:46:15.257 --> 00:46:19.497
You have no reason to tell me, but you don't
have reasons to hide it from me, either. Why?

00:46:19.497 --> 00:46:23.667
- Why, exactly?
- I'll tell you since you seem to be mistaken.

00:46:23.667 --> 00:46:25.827
Think carefully.

00:46:25.827 --> 00:46:32.377
Do you think I'm here putting all in to
chase criminals just to chase news?

00:46:32.377 --> 00:46:35.097
Because I feel sorry
for the victims who died?

00:46:35.097 --> 00:46:37.747
The world is full of such tragedies.

00:46:37.747 --> 00:46:41.937
I don't have the time to go
around rescuing all those people!

00:46:42.737 --> 00:46:44.857
Then, what's your reason?

00:46:48.267 --> 00:46:52.817
I'm a victim, also. I'm the fifth victim.

00:46:55.217 --> 00:46:58.127
Because they never caught the suspect here,

00:46:58.127 --> 00:47:01.117
I was going to die like your mom.

00:47:01.117 --> 00:47:03.307
That's why I'm here to save my life.

Everything that happened
in this town in 1987!

00:47:06.997 --> 00:47:11.337
I came here with all the data from newspapers,
news broadcasts, and even police reports!

00:47:11.337 --> 00:47:15.767
But because of one little variable,
now everything might change!

00:47:15.767 --> 00:47:19.507
Just thinking about that, I
feel like my head will explode.

00:47:20.857 --> 00:47:23.037
But you know what?

00:47:24.597 --> 00:47:28.097
Do you know who the
biggest variable is here?

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:33.597
Is that why you sent me
to my mom's last night?

00:47:35.547 --> 00:47:39.267
Because I shouldn't be
curious about such variables,

00:47:39.924 --> 00:47:42.367
and don't interfere with anything.

00:47:42.367 --> 00:47:44.127

I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

00:47:55.275 --> 00:48:00.947
As long as I'm here, I can't
sit here like an idiot and wait.

00:48:03.027 --> 00:48:05.557
If you don't want me to know, that's fine.

00:48:06.257 --> 00:48:08.847

What if Beom Ryong cries
and tries to hold onto me?

one for him in this world.

Hey, Baek Yoon Young.

00:48:43.799 --> 00:48:47.739
The afternoon when the body of
the first woman was discovered,

00:48:47.739 --> 00:48:52.269
several suspicious scenes
occurred in the town.

00:48:52.269 --> 00:48:57.269
The man with the blue hair stood
between the sun and the moon.

00:48:57.269 --> 00:49:03.469
The man with the glasses didn't come
out of the third stall for a long while.

00:49:03.469 --> 00:49:09.629
The man who lost his memory didn't
realize he was lying under the bridge.

00:49:16.529 --> 00:49:20.619
Since today is the day they would've
discovered Lee Joo Young dead,

00:49:20.619 --> 00:49:23.949
this will take place this afternoon.

00:49:23.949 --> 00:49:28.579
If the blue-haired man really
means the blue cap, then...

00:49:32.239 --> 00:49:35.319
what would be between the sun and the moon?

00:49:35.319 --> 00:49:37.159
I don't know.

00:49:37.159 --> 00:49:38.759

00:49:38.759 --> 00:49:40.699

00:49:43.279 --> 00:49:46.199
Just go see Yoo Beom Ryong.

00:49:46.199 --> 00:49:49.179
It's something you should
experience at least once.

00:49:50.259 --> 00:49:52.689
All right.

00:49:55.999 --> 00:49:59.539
But don't hang out with anyone
who writes that kind of story.

00:50:02.869 --> 00:50:04.329

A man stood between the
sun and the moon vacantly.

00:53:51.839 --> 00:53:54.739
If there's a sentence like that,

00:53:54.739 --> 00:53:58.009
what could "between the sun and moon" mean?

00:54:04.379 --> 00:54:06.709
How would I know?

00:54:13.899 --> 00:54:16.349

I knew I had to tell you, but I decided
on my own and kept it to myself.

you to her house last night.

I think I understand
why you kept it from me.

Because he's my family.

Yes, that's right.
