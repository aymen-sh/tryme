WEBVTT

00:10:57.075 --> 00:10:58.409
Morning.

00:11:12.215 --> 00:11:14.634
- Do I look like I'm infected?
- Show us your arm.

00:11:22.934 --> 00:11:24.853
Yeah, it's not getting any worse,
is it?

00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:30.584
If we're out in the open city,
why aren't we getting swarmed?

00:11:30.608 --> 00:11:32.610
- Don't worry about that.
- Well, I'm gonna.

00:11:32.694 --> 00:11:34.988
What was Marlene doing
with an infected kid?

00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:36.656
I'm not infected.

00:11:39.826 --> 00:11:41.494
She found me after I was bitten.

00:11:41.578 --> 00:11:43.496
- And she didn't shoot you.
- Clearly not.

00:11:44.706 --> 00:11:46.475
She locked me up
and had her guys test me every day

00:11:46.499 --> 00:11:47.499
to see if I was getting sick.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.710
Test you how?

00:11:48.793 --> 00:11:52.046
- I have to pee.
- Test you... how?

00:11:53.256 --> 00:11:54.942
They'd make me count to ten
and hold out my hand,

00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:55.966
and then keep it steady.

00:11:55.967 --> 00:11:57.361
But, you know, I think
what really impressed them

00:11:57.385 --> 00:12:00.388
was the fact that I didn't turn
into a fucking monster.

00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:02.515
Now can I, please?

00:12:07.312 --> 00:12:08.313
Fine.

00:12:09.063 --> 00:12:10.648
Back there. You can find a spot.

00:12:15.445 --> 00:12:16.446
And, here.

00:12:19.115 --> 00:12:20.450
Tear out a few pages.

00:12:22.243 --> 00:12:23.804
There's not gonna be
anything bad in here?

00:12:23.828 --> 00:12:26.039
- Just you.
- Oh, funny.

00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:38.133
Broken.

00:12:39.677 --> 00:12:40.762
Maybe a hairline.

00:12:41.846 --> 00:12:43.056
It'll heal fast.

00:12:52.398 --> 00:12:53.751
She made it through
the fucking night, Joel.

00:12:53.775 --> 00:12:54.775
It doesn't matter.

00:12:54.817 --> 00:12:56.986
It's gonna happen sooner or later.

00:12:59.113 --> 00:13:00.424
All right?
We're still close to the wall.

00:13:00.448 --> 00:13:01.648
We sneak her back into the QZ.

00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:03.302
We find a different way
to get the battery.

00:13:03.326 --> 00:13:05.119
This is our best shot.

00:13:07.789 --> 00:13:10.708
We take her back to the QZ,
someone's gonna notice her arm.

00:13:10.792 --> 00:13:13.044
They're gonna scan her,
then they'll kill her.

00:13:13.127 --> 00:13:14.629
Well, better them than us.

00:13:15.755 --> 00:13:18.067
You need to stop talkin' about this kid
like she's got some kind of life

00:13:18.091 --> 00:13:19.092
in front of her.

00:13:30.395 --> 00:13:31.521
You hungry?

00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:33.648
You can share some of ours.

00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:36.109
Thanks. Marlene sent me with my own.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.545
Is that chicken?

00:13:56.212 --> 00:13:57.213
Yeah.

00:13:58.089 --> 00:13:59.841
Marlene said they get it from smugglers.

00:14:02.135 --> 00:14:03.302
Guess not you guys.

00:14:07.473 --> 00:14:09.392
- Hey. Hey!
- Why...

00:14:09.475 --> 00:14:11.936
why are you so important to Marlene?

00:14:12.478 --> 00:14:14.856
And don't lie to me
or we'll take you back.

00:14:15.273 --> 00:14:17.066
You take me back,
you don't get your battery.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.526
You heard that?

00:14:19.569 --> 00:14:21.779
Then you must've heard
that he wants to shoot you.

00:14:27.702 --> 00:14:29.746
I'm gonna talk to you
like you're an adult.

00:14:30.288 --> 00:14:31.288
Okay?

00:14:31.581 --> 00:14:33.416
Joel and I aren't good people.

00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:36.377
We're doin' this for us

00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:38.588
because, apparently,
you're worth something.

00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:40.381
But we don't know what you're worth,

00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:41.924
if we don't know what we have.

00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:44.469
So answer my question.

00:14:53.102 --> 00:14:56.022
She told me not to tell anybody
and now I'm telling the first people...

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.072
There's a Firefly base camp
somewhere out west...

00:15:04.989 --> 00:15:06.032
with doctors.

00:15:06.449 --> 00:15:09.035
- They're working on a cure.
- I've heard this before.

00:15:09.118 --> 00:15:10.870
And whatever happened to me is the key...

00:15:10.953 --> 00:15:13.234
...Is the key to finding the vaccine.
That's what this is?

00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:15.583
We've heard this a million times.

00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:18.169
Vaccines, miracle cures,
none of it works, ever.

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:19.796
Fuck you, man. I didn't ask for this.

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:20.879
You and me both.

00:15:20.922 --> 00:15:22.715
This isn't gonna end well, Tess.

00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:24.759
We need to go back.

00:15:33.017 --> 00:15:34.185
Let's just finish it.

00:15:34.852 --> 00:15:37.897
It doesn't matter if she is
or she isn't what the Fireflies say.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.316
If they believe that she is, then...

00:15:41.526 --> 00:15:42.652
we get what we want.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.829
If she so much as twitches.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.498
Don't.

00:15:58.543 --> 00:15:59.543
Okay.

00:16:04.048 --> 00:16:05.048
Okay?

00:16:08.636 --> 00:16:09.636
Okay.

00:16:20.731 --> 00:16:21.732
Can I have a gun?

00:16:21.816 --> 00:16:23.151
- Absolutely not.
- No.

00:16:23.234 --> 00:16:25.903
Okay, Jesus. Fine. I'll have to throw
a fucking sandwich at them.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.130
It's clear.

00:17:05.234 --> 00:17:06.319
Whoa.

00:17:07.195 --> 00:17:09.697
Yeah, looks different
in the daylight, huh?

00:17:25.838 --> 00:17:26.923
We should get moving.

00:17:39.352 --> 00:17:41.729
It's like a fucked up moon.

00:17:41.812 --> 00:17:43.022
Is this where they bombed?

00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:44.731
Yeah.

00:17:45.149 --> 00:17:46.984
They hit
most of the big cities like this.

00:17:47.068 --> 00:17:49.070
They had to slow the spread somehow.

00:17:50.863 --> 00:17:53.407
Worked here,
but it didn't in most places.

00:18:03.251 --> 00:18:05.127
So the Statehouse is across there.

00:18:05.211 --> 00:18:07.421
It's about a ten-minute walk
if you could go straight.

00:18:07.588 --> 00:18:09.966
- So...
- Long way or short way?

00:18:10.049 --> 00:18:13.177
I mean, it's the long way
or the "We're fucking dead" way.

00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:14.470
Well, I vote long way,

00:18:14.553 --> 00:18:16.514
just based on that limited information.

00:18:18.266 --> 00:18:20.309
We have to check it
from the hotel first.

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:23.019
Okay.

00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:41.914
Where the fuck are they already?

00:18:42.498 --> 00:18:43.858
You'll know it when they're close.

00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:45.960
I didn't know last time.

00:18:48.337 --> 00:18:49.714
How did you get bit?

00:18:50.965 --> 00:18:52.758
You know the old mall in the QZ?

00:18:53.718 --> 00:18:55.279
The one that's sealed off
and boarded up

00:18:55.303 --> 00:18:57.305
and no one's supposed to go in, ever?

00:18:57.388 --> 00:18:58.388
That one?

00:18:59.015 --> 00:19:00.641
Whatever. I snuck in.

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:02.977
I wanted to see what it was like.

00:19:03.644 --> 00:19:05.205
Didn't think there was gonna
be anything in there,

00:19:05.229 --> 00:19:07.606
and then, one just came at me
out of nowhere.

00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:10.151
Thought I got away, but...

00:19:11.902 --> 00:19:13.779
So it was just you in there alone?

00:19:15.698 --> 00:19:16.698
Yeah.

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:19.660
How old are you?

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:21.453
Fourteen.

00:19:22.038 --> 00:19:23.038
Wow.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.920
Well, I mean,
you got some balls on you, sister.

00:19:27.418 --> 00:19:28.418
Thanks.

00:19:41.807 --> 00:19:43.893
Nobody's gonna be
coming after you, right?

00:19:43.976 --> 00:19:47.772
Like Mom, Dad, boyfriend?

00:19:47.855 --> 00:19:48.939
I'm an orphan,

00:19:49.023 --> 00:19:51.067
and, no.

00:19:56.489 --> 00:19:58.491
Everyone said the open city was crazy.

00:19:59.408 --> 00:20:01.994
Like, swarms of Infected running
around everywhere.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.205
Not exactly like that.

00:20:04.288 --> 00:20:06.082
You know, people like to tell stories.

00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:11.295
So there aren't Super-Infected
that explode fungus spores on you?

00:20:11.379 --> 00:20:12.880
Shit, I hope not.

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:16.884
Or ones with split-open heads
that see in the dark like bats?

00:20:30.523 --> 00:20:31.523
What was that?

00:20:35.778 --> 00:20:36.987
Let's keep moving.

00:21:13.816 --> 00:21:15.901
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:21:17.153 --> 00:21:18.553
You ever stay in a place like this?

00:21:19.613 --> 00:21:20.853
No. A little out of our league.

00:21:20.906 --> 00:21:22.217
How do you even know
what this is?

00:21:22.241 --> 00:21:23.576
Have you heard of books?

00:21:26.412 --> 00:21:27.852
Wait, are we going in there?

00:21:28.497 --> 00:21:31.000
Yeah, we've gotta get
to the stairwell on the other side.

00:21:33.252 --> 00:21:34.962
Well, I don't know how to swim.

00:21:35.671 --> 00:21:36.629
Seriously?

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.424
Do you think we have pools in the QZ?

00:21:38.507 --> 00:21:40.885
No, smartass, I mean...

00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:45.014
I don't know how I was supposed
to know that.

00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:58.444
This is so gross.

00:22:00.905 --> 00:22:02.072
Oh, check it out.

00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:10.581
Ding, ding!

00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.542
Yes, sir.
I would like your finest suite, please.

00:22:13.626 --> 00:22:15.937
Yes, ma'am. Would you
like me to take your luggage?

00:22:15.961 --> 00:22:18.172
Yes, ma'am.
Right away, ma'am. I...

00:22:18.255 --> 00:22:19.213
You're a weird kid.

00:22:19.215 --> 00:22:20.633
You're a weird kid.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.300
Oh, fuck me!

00:22:31.101 --> 00:22:32.561
I'm sorry.

00:22:46.242 --> 00:22:47.993
- Are you okay?
- Yep.

00:22:48.536 --> 00:22:49.870
Fucking fabulous.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.137
Fuck. Holy shit.

00:23:07.221 --> 00:23:08.639
Come on, it wasn't that bad.

00:23:09.181 --> 00:23:12.101
You try climbing ten fucking floors
with our knees, see how you feel.

00:23:23.112 --> 00:23:24.989
Well, when the fuck
did that happen?

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.620
Maybe that one?

00:23:35.207 --> 00:23:36.207
No.

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:39.837
All right. Well, I mean,
maybe I could climb up there,

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.840
work my way around
and open it from the inside.

00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:44.174
No. Well, I'm the smallest.

00:23:44.258 --> 00:23:45.884
So, it'd be easier for me
to get through.

00:23:45.968 --> 00:23:48.762
But you die and we get nothing.
You stay.

00:23:49.138 --> 00:23:50.180
Can you give me a hand?

00:24:10.784 --> 00:24:11.910
You good up there?

00:24:11.994 --> 00:24:12.994
Yeah.

00:24:13.996 --> 00:24:17.124
It's a bit of a mess,
so I'm gonna need a few minutes.

00:24:49.198 --> 00:24:50.199
Nice knife.

00:24:55.663 --> 00:24:57.915
- Where'd you learn to do that?
- The circus.

00:25:11.428 --> 00:25:12.428
Where are you from?

00:25:14.973 --> 00:25:16.016
Texas.

00:25:17.017 --> 00:25:17.935
What about Tess?

00:25:17.936 --> 00:25:19.812
Detroit. It's in Michigan.

00:25:19.895 --> 00:25:21.897
I go to school.
I know where Detroit is.

00:25:27.695 --> 00:25:30.322
So, you two like a...

00:25:30.406 --> 00:25:31.406
Pass.

00:25:32.533 --> 00:25:34.576
- How'd you end up in Boston?
- Pass.

00:25:35.285 --> 00:25:36.829
No more questions about me.

00:25:43.836 --> 00:25:45.045
How long do Infected live?

00:25:45.129 --> 00:25:48.382
- Oh, I thought you went to school.
- It's a really shitty one.

00:25:51.301 --> 00:25:53.262
Well, some last about a month or two.

00:25:54.972 --> 00:25:57.474
But there's others, been walking around
about 20 years.

00:26:01.895 --> 00:26:02.896
You ever kill one?

00:26:03.355 --> 00:26:04.835
Yeah, I've killed lots of 'em.

00:26:10.154 --> 00:26:11.238
Was it hard?

00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:13.741
Like, knowing they were people once?

00:26:18.162 --> 00:26:19.204
Sometimes.

00:26:22.458 --> 00:26:23.917
What about that guy last night?

00:26:29.214 --> 00:26:30.841
Put the gun down, Joel.

00:26:41.435 --> 00:26:42.519
What now?

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.817
There's so many.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.960
The last time we were here,

00:27:30.984 --> 00:27:32.903
they were still deep inside
the buildings.

00:27:33.237 --> 00:27:35.781
But I guess enough people came through
looking for the QZ,

00:27:35.864 --> 00:27:37.491
and went inside, seeking shelter,

00:27:38.158 --> 00:27:39.969
and that's how they get
more and more of the city,

00:27:39.993 --> 00:27:41.578
bit by bit, year after year.

00:27:53.215 --> 00:27:54.341
They're connected.

00:27:55.384 --> 00:27:56.677
More than you know.

00:27:57.553 --> 00:27:59.721
The fungus also grows underground.

00:27:59.805 --> 00:28:03.267
Long fibers, like wires,
some of them stretching over a mile.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.144
You step on a patch
of cordyceps in one place,

00:28:06.603 --> 00:28:10.190
and you can wake a dozen Infected
from somewhere else.

00:28:10.899 --> 00:28:13.360
Now they know where you are,
now they come.

00:28:14.528 --> 00:28:16.572
You're not immune
from being ripped apart.

00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:18.866
You understand?

00:28:20.492 --> 00:28:21.618
It's important.

00:28:22.786 --> 00:28:24.204
I'm trying to keep you alive.

00:28:31.712 --> 00:28:33.171
So we're not going that way.

00:28:34.548 --> 00:28:35.548
No.

00:28:37.217 --> 00:28:38.218
What do we do then?

00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:40.762
Short way?

00:28:45.183 --> 00:28:46.268
Museum.

00:29:07.623 --> 00:29:09.541
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.045
Well, there's a way across
from the top floor.

00:29:13.128 --> 00:29:14.421
Well, then I guess it's fine.

00:29:14.504 --> 00:29:16.632
- We used to take it all the time.
- Okay.

00:29:16.715 --> 00:29:18.926
- Well, it was fine.
- Awesome.

00:29:30.312 --> 00:29:31.355
It's bone dry.

00:29:32.439 --> 00:29:34.524
It could mean
they're all finally dead in there.

00:29:40.364 --> 00:29:41.448
Oh, man.

00:29:43.575 --> 00:29:45.911
Marlene pack you one of these
or just sandwiches?

00:29:45.994 --> 00:29:46.994
Yeah.

00:29:48.246 --> 00:29:50.624
Okay. So, more ground rules.

00:29:50.707 --> 00:29:52.250
We're gonna go slowly.

00:29:52.334 --> 00:29:54.214
You come up against anything,
you get behind us,

00:29:54.252 --> 00:29:55.252
and you stay there, okay?

00:29:55.963 --> 00:29:56.963
Yes.

00:30:01.843 --> 00:30:03.011
I have a spare hand.

00:30:03.637 --> 00:30:04.930
Congratulations.

00:30:59.568 --> 00:31:01.862
Yeah, cooked.

00:31:02.821 --> 00:31:04.406
Finally, some fucking luck.

00:31:04.865 --> 00:31:07.265
I guess we should've gone
this way in the first place.

00:31:09.244 --> 00:31:10.495
Oh, shit.

00:31:16.209 --> 00:31:17.586
What the fuck did that?

00:31:22.758 --> 00:31:23.758
Maybe...

00:31:25.761 --> 00:31:27.471
Maybe he was attacked outside

00:31:27.804 --> 00:31:29.139
and crawled through the doors.

00:31:29.222 --> 00:31:31.349
The door was open.
It could've been him.

00:31:33.018 --> 00:31:34.018
I don't hear anything.

00:31:34.019 --> 00:31:35.271
Who would you hear?

00:31:37.272 --> 00:31:38.482
Who would you hear?

00:31:39.566 --> 00:31:41.566
Are you saying an Infected did that?

00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:45.655
Because I've been attacked by one,
and it wasn't like that.

00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:51.369
Okay, from this point
forward, we are silent.

00:31:51.912 --> 00:31:53.872
Not quiet, silent.

00:31:53.955 --> 00:31:55.791
- Well...
- No questions.

00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:57.875
Just do it.

00:35:29.087 --> 00:35:32.132
They can't see,
but they can hear.

00:36:08.001 --> 00:36:09.461
Run!

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:27.062
Run! Run!

00:39:10.475 --> 00:39:11.475
You all right?

00:39:11.476 --> 00:39:12.728
Twisted ankle, but...

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.771
yeah.

00:39:17.774 --> 00:39:18.774
You all right?

00:39:19.526 --> 00:39:21.486
Well, I didn't shit my pants, so...

00:39:24.906 --> 00:39:26.449
You fucking kidding me?

00:39:28.701 --> 00:39:31.246
I mean, if it was gonna happen
to one of us...

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:36.626
Hey, let's get the fuck out of here.

00:39:56.187 --> 00:39:57.981
- Put this around your arm.
- Thanks.

00:40:01.442 --> 00:40:02.402
Over there?

00:40:02.403 --> 00:40:03.987
Yeah, I know it looks scary.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.656
That was scary. This is wood.

00:40:09.951 --> 00:40:11.995
Just wait there. Give us a minute.

00:40:23.506 --> 00:40:25.133
There's probably more ahead.

00:40:26.342 --> 00:40:27.844
So we'll deal with it then.

00:40:28.845 --> 00:40:30.179
I got it.

00:40:34.642 --> 00:40:35.685
What about the kid?

00:40:36.394 --> 00:40:39.230
Maybe the first bite didn't take,
but what about the second one?

00:40:39.314 --> 00:40:40.982
How about you just take
the good news?

00:40:42.483 --> 00:40:43.483
Can you do that?

00:40:44.235 --> 00:40:46.613
Hate to think for once
maybe we could actually win?

00:40:49.407 --> 00:40:50.908
Just go. Go watch her.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.602
Is it everything you hoped for?

00:41:18.895 --> 00:41:20.021
Jury's still out.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.651
But, man, you can't deny that view.

00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:33.993
Come on.
Let's get there before it's dark.

00:42:51.612 --> 00:42:53.212
Where the fuck are they?

00:43:34.906 --> 00:43:35.906
Stay back.

00:44:07.605 --> 00:44:08.605
Joel?

00:44:09.774 --> 00:44:10.817
What the fuck is going on?

00:44:11.484 --> 00:44:12.568
I don't know.

00:44:17.073 --> 00:44:18.073
They went inside.

00:44:23.955 --> 00:44:26.207
- Come on!
- Tess.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.290
Tess!

00:44:38.928 --> 00:44:40.054
Holy shit.

00:44:43.182 --> 00:44:44.183
Jesus.

00:44:53.818 --> 00:44:54.818
Okay.

00:44:55.152 --> 00:44:58.573
I mean, there's gotta be
a fucking radio or something, right?

00:45:01.659 --> 00:45:03.369
Who killed them? FEDRA?

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.620
No.

00:45:07.957 --> 00:45:09.333
One of them got bit.

00:45:09.625 --> 00:45:12.795
The healthy ones fought the sick ones.
Everyone lost. Tess.

00:45:12.879 --> 00:45:13.963
What are you doing?

00:45:14.797 --> 00:45:17.049
Where did Marlene say
that she was taking you?

00:45:17.508 --> 00:45:18.424
Ellie?

00:45:18.426 --> 00:45:21.304
- I don't know, just west.
- Just west. Fuck.

00:45:21.387 --> 00:45:25.600
Okay. Well, I mean, one of them's
gotta have a map on them, right?

00:45:25.683 --> 00:45:27.852
- Joel? Can you help me?
- No!

00:45:27.935 --> 00:45:30.479
Tess, it's over.

00:45:30.563 --> 00:45:33.649
- We are going home.
- That's not my fucking home!

00:45:48.789 --> 00:45:49.874
I'm staying.

00:45:51.876 --> 00:45:52.876
I mean,

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.254
our luck had to run out sooner or later.

00:45:57.381 --> 00:45:58.466
Fuck.

00:45:59.884 --> 00:46:01.010
She's infected.

00:46:09.602 --> 00:46:10.645
Show me.

00:46:12.688 --> 00:46:13.688
Joel.

00:46:27.078 --> 00:46:28.496
Oops, right?

00:46:36.671 --> 00:46:37.922
Take your bandage off.

00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:46.472
Look, Joel.

00:46:48.933 --> 00:46:50.184
This is real.

00:46:50.267 --> 00:46:51.727
Joel, she's fucking real.

00:46:55.982 --> 00:46:57.622
I need you to get her
to Bill and Frank's.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:58.794
- No.
- They'll take her off your hands.

00:46:58.818 --> 00:46:59.836
They'll handle it from here.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.488
No, I can't. They won't take her.
They're not gonna take her.

00:47:02.571 --> 00:47:05.074
They will 'cause you'll convince them.
Yes, you will.

00:47:05.157 --> 00:47:06.951
I never ask you for anything.

00:47:07.034 --> 00:47:08.553
- Not to feel the way I felt, not to...
- No.

00:47:08.577 --> 00:47:10.617
Will you shut the fuck up?
'Cause I don't have time.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.331
This is your chance.

00:47:13.624 --> 00:47:14.625
You get her there.

00:47:15.918 --> 00:47:17.086
You keep her alive.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.923
And you set everything right.

00:47:24.427 --> 00:47:25.720
All the shit we did.

00:47:26.721 --> 00:47:28.764
Please say yes, Joel. Please.

00:47:28.848 --> 00:47:30.599
Oh, fuck!

00:48:20.274 --> 00:48:21.650
- How many?
- All of them.

00:48:21.734 --> 00:48:22.777
Maybe a minute.

00:48:35.998 --> 00:48:36.999
What are you doing?

00:48:37.083 --> 00:48:38.751
Making sure that they don't follow you.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.640
Joel.

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.230
Save who you can save.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.280
No!

00:49:09.615 --> 00:49:11.408
We're not leaving her!

00:49:11.492 --> 00:49:13.244
Get off me, you fucker!

00:49:13.327 --> 00:49:14.662
I'm not going with you!
