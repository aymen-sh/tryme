JAKARTA, INDONESIA
SEPTEMBER 24th, 2003

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.315
KEMENTERIAN KESEHATAN
REPUBLIK INDONESIA

00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:12.278
THE LAST OF US

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.948
Morning.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:14.298
-Do I look like I'm infected?
-Show us your arm.

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:24.517
Yeah, it's not getting any worse, is it?

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.772
If we're out in the open city,
why aren't we getting swarmed?

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:31.982
-Don't worry about that.
-Well, I'm gonna.

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:34.360
What was Marlene doing
with an infected kid?

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:35.986
I'm not infected.

00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:40.825
She found me after I was bitten.

00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:42.827
-And she didn't shoot you.
-Clearly not.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.663
She locked me up
and had her guys test me every day

00:11:45.746 --> 00:11:46.789
to see if I was getting sick.

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:48.040
Test you how?

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:51.710
-I have to pee.
-Test you, how?

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:54.130
They'd make me count to 10
and hold out my hand

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.089
and then keep it steady.

00:11:55.172 --> 00:11:56.549
But, you know,
I think what really impressed them

00:11:56.632 --> 00:12:00.177
was the fact that I didn't
turn into a fucking monster.

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:01.846
Now can I please?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.518
Fine.

00:12:08.352 --> 00:12:10.271
Back there. You can find a spot.

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:15.818
And here.

00:12:18.362 --> 00:12:20.114
Tear out a few pages.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.908
There's not gonna be
anything bad in here?

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:23.868
Just you.

00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:25.494
Oh, funny.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.798
Broken.

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:42.344
Maybe a hairline. It'll heal fast.

00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:52.897
She made it through
the fuckin' night, Joel.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.064
It doesn't matter.

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:56.692
It's gonna happen sooner or later.

00:12:58.402 --> 00:12:59.653
All right?
We're still close to the wall.

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:00.946
We sneak her back into the QZ.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.698
We find a different way
to get the battery.

00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:04.909
This is our best shot.

00:13:07.077 --> 00:13:09.955
We take her back to the QZ,
someone's gonna notice her arm,

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.500
they're gonna scan her,
then they'll kill her.

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:14.210
Well, better them then us.

00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:16.128
You need to stop talkin' about this kid

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.756
like she's got some kinda life
in front of her.

00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:30.851
You hungry?

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.937
You can share some of ours.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.564
Thanks.
Marlene sent me with my own.

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:55.167
Is that chicken?

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.377
Yeah.

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:59.672
Marlene said they get it from smugglers.

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:03.133
Guess not you guys.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.681
-Hey. Hey!
-Why--

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:11.225
why are you so important to Marlene?

00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:14.228
And don't lie to me
or we'll take you back.

00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:16.230
You take me back,
you don't get your battery.

00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:17.856
You heard that?

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:21.110
Then you must've heard
that he wants to shoot you.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.451
I'm gonna talk to you
like you're an adult.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.744
Okay?

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:32.746
Joel and I aren't good people.

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:35.624
We're doin' this for us

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.960
because, apparently,
you're worth something.

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:41.255
But we don't know what you're worth
if we don't know what we have.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.049
So answer my question.

00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:53.434
She told me not to tell anybody,

00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:55.644
and now I'm telling
the first people that I--

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:04.278
There's a Firefly base camp
somewhere out west,

00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:05.654
with doctors.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.406
They're working on a cure.

00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:08.365
I've heard this before.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:11.285
And whatever happened to me,
is the key to finding the vaccine.

00:15:11.368 --> 00:15:12.953
That's what this is?

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:14.955
We've heard this a million times.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.541
Vaccines, miracle cures.
None of it works.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.043
-Ever.
-Fuck you, man. I didn't ask for this.

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:20.210
You and me both.

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:22.463
This isn't gonna end well, Tess.

00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:24.089
We need to go back.

00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:33.515
Let's just finish it.

00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:36.852
It doesn't matter if she is
or she isn't what the Fireflies say.

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:39.938
If they believe that she is then,

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.441
we get what we want.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:52.326
If she so much as twitches.

00:15:53.702 --> 00:15:54.787
Don't.

00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:58.707
Okay.

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.421
Okay?

00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:08.801
Okay.

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:21.188
Can I have a gun?

00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:22.481
-Absolutely not.
-No.

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:25.526
Okay, Jesus. Fine. I'll have to throw
a fuckin' sandwich at them.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.336
It's clear.

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:09.361
Yeah, looks different
in the daylight, huh?

00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:26.253
We should get movin'.

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:41.018
It's like a fucked-up moon.

00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:43.729
-Is this where they bombed?
-Yeah.

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:46.273
They hit most of the big cities like this.

00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:48.400
They had to slow the spread somehow.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.030
Worked here,
but it didn't in most places.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.082
So, the State House is across there.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.794
It's about a 10-minute walk
if you could go straight.

00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:09.213
-So?
-Long way or short way?

00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:12.424
I mean, it's the long way
or the "we're fuckin' dead" way.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:16.053
Well, I vote long way
just based on that limited information.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.640
We have to check it from the hotel first.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.142
Okay.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.662
Where the fuck are they already?

00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:43.997
You'll know it when they're close.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:45.624
I didn't know last time.

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:49.378
How did you get bit?

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.881
You know the old mall in the QZ?

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.466
The one that's sealed off
and boarded up,

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.468
and no one's supposed to go in, ever?

00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:57.678
That one?

00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:00.097
Whatever. I snuck in.

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:02.933
Wanted to see what it was like.

00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:04.393
Didn't think there was
gonna be anything in there,

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:07.020
and then one just
came at me outta nowhere.

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:09.648
Thought I got away, but.

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:13.068
So it was just you in there, alone?

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:15.904
Yeah.

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:19.616
How old are you?

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.243
Fourteen.

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.244
Wow.

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:25.831
Well, I mean,
you got some balls on you, sister.

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:27.624
Thanks.

00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:43.140
Nobody's gonna be comin' after you, right?

00:19:43.223 --> 00:19:44.391
Like, Mom,

00:19:44.474 --> 00:19:45.976
Dad,

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:47.019
boyfriend?

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:48.270
I'm an orphan,

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:50.647
and, no.

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:57.863
Everyone said the open city was crazy.

00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:01.325
Like, swarms of Infected
running around everywhere.

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.452
Not exactly like that.

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:06.079
You know, people like to tell stories.

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:10.500
So, there aren't Super-Infected
that explode fungus spores on you?

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.336
Shit, I hope not.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.423
Or ones with split-open heads
that see in the dark like bats?

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:30.687
What was that?

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.610
Let's keep movin'.

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:15.440
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.276
Ya ever stay in a place like this?

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:20.070
No, a little out of our league.

00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:22.864
-How do you even know what this is?
-Have you heard of books?

00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:27.202
Wait, are we going in there?

00:21:27.744 --> 00:21:30.288
Yeah, we gotta get to the stairwell
on the other side.

00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:34.292
Well, I don't know how to swim.

00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:37.629
-Seriously?
-Do you think we have pools in the QZ?

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:39.172
No, smart ass.

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:40.173
I mean.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.636
I don't know how I was supposed
to know that.

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:57.733
This is so gross.

00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:01.695
Check it out!

00:22:08.368 --> 00:22:09.911
Ding, ding.

00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:12.914
Yes, sir. I would like your
finest suite, please.

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:15.208
Yes, ma'am.
Would you like me to take your luggage?

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:18.503
-Yes, ma'am. Right away, ma'am--
-You're a weird kid.

00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:20.464
You're a weird kid.

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:21.506
Oh fuck!

00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:26.762
Oh, my God.

00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:32.392
Sorry.

00:22:45.572 --> 00:22:49.785
-You okay?
-Yep. Fucking fabulous.

00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:06.426
Fuck. Holy shit.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.345
Come on, it wasn't that bad.

00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:10.597
You try climbing ten fuckin' floors
with our knees.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.224
See how ya feel.

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:24.903
Well, when the fuck did that happen?

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:32.369
Maybe that one.

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:35.622
No.

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:39.084
All right, well, I mean,
maybe I could climb up there,

00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:42.003
work my way around,
and open it from the inside?

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:45.006
No, well, I'm the smallest,
so it'd be easier for me to get through.

00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:48.343
But you die and we get nothing.
You stay.

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:49.970
Can you give me a hand?

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.158
You good up there?

00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:16.872
Yeah, it's a bit of a mess,
so I'm gonna need a few minutes.

00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:49.529
Nice knife.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.537
-Where'd you learn to do that?
-The circus.

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:12.385
Where are you from?

00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:15.222
Texas.

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:19.142
-What about Tess?
-Detroit. It's in Michigan.

00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:21.895
I go to school. I know where Detroit is.

00:25:26.942 --> 00:25:29.653
So, you two like a--

00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:30.528
Pass.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.907
-How'd you end up in Boston?
-Pass.

00:25:34.574 --> 00:25:36.117
No more questions about me.

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:44.376
How long do Infected live?

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:45.752
I thought you went to school.

00:25:45.835 --> 00:25:47.921
It's a really shitty one.

00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:53.093
Well, some last about a month or two.

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:56.763
But there's others been walkin' around
'bout 20 years.

00:26:01.184 --> 00:26:04.312
-Ever kill one?
-Yeah, I killed lots of 'em.

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.527
Was it hard?

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:13.697
Like, knowing they were people once?

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:18.743
Sometimes.

00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:23.248
What about that guy last night?

00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:31.047
You can put the gun down, Joel.

00:26:40.682 --> 00:26:42.225
What now?

00:27:27.854 --> 00:27:29.647
There's so many.

00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:32.442
The last time we were here,
they were still deep inside the buildings.

00:27:32.525 --> 00:27:35.070
Then I guess enough people came through
looking for the QZ,

00:27:35.153 --> 00:27:37.322
they went inside seeking shelter,

00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:41.326
and that's how they get more and more
of the city bit by bit, year after year.

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:53.880
They're connected.

00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:56.216
More than you know.

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:59.094
The fungus also grows underground.

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:02.889
Long fibers like wires,
some of them stretching over a mile.

00:28:02.972 --> 00:28:05.809
Now, you step on a patch
of cordyceps in one place,

00:28:05.892 --> 00:28:09.521
and you can wake a dozen Infected
from somewhere else.

00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:12.690
Now they know where you are,
now they come.

00:28:13.775 --> 00:28:16.111
You're not immune from being ripped apart.

00:28:16.986 --> 00:28:18.321
You understand?

00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:21.116
It's important.

00:28:21.991 --> 00:28:23.535
I'm tryin' to keep you alive.

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:32.502
So we're not goin' that way.

00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:34.712
No.

00:28:36.464 --> 00:28:37.799
What do we do then?

00:28:39.008 --> 00:28:40.635
Short way?

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:45.557
Museum.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.997
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

00:29:09.747 --> 00:29:12.208
Well, there's a way
across from the top floor.

00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:13.710
Well, then I guess it's fine.

00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:16.004
-We used to take it all the time.
-Okay.

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:18.506
-Look, it was fine.
-Awesome.

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:30.894
It's bone dry.

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:33.938
It could mean they're
all finally dead in there.

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:40.778
Oh, man.

00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:44.073
Marlene pack you one of these

00:29:44.157 --> 00:29:45.700
-or just sandwiches?
-Yeah.

00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:49.954
Okay, so, more ground rules.

00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:51.623
We're gonna go slowly.

00:29:51.706 --> 00:29:53.374
If we come up against anything,
you get behind us

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:55.168
and ya stay there, okay?

00:29:55.251 --> 00:29:56.169
Yes.

00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:02.342
I have a spare hand.

00:30:02.842 --> 00:30:04.385
Congratulations.

00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:01.109
Yeah, cooked.

00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:03.695
Finally, some fuckin' luck.

00:31:04.153 --> 00:31:07.073
I guess we should've gone
this way in the first place.

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:09.784
Oh shit!

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:16.916
What the fuck did that?

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:23.590
Maybe,

00:31:25.008 --> 00:31:28.344
maybe he was attacked outside,
and crawled through the doors.

00:31:28.428 --> 00:31:30.972
The door was open.
Could've been him.

00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:34.851
-I don't hear anything.
-Who would you hear?

00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:38.730
Who would you hear?

00:31:38.813 --> 00:31:40.982
Are you saying an Infected did that?

00:31:41.941 --> 00:31:44.944
Because I've been attacked by one
and it wasn't like that.

00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:51.075
Okay, from this point forward,
we are silent.

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:53.244
Not quiet. Silent.

00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:57.081
-What--
-No. No questions. Just do it.

INDEPENDENCE HALL

They can't see, but they can hear.

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:08.749
Run!

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:26.392
Run, run!

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:14.018
-You all right?
-Twisted ankle, but, yeah.

00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:18.689
You all right?

00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:21.317
Well, I didn't shit my pants, so.

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:26.113
You fucking kidding me?

00:39:27.948 --> 00:39:30.868
I mean, if it was gonna
happen to one of us.

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:34.622
Hey,

00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:36.457
let's get the fuck outta here.

00:39:55.184 --> 00:39:57.311
-Put this around your arm.
-Thanks.

00:40:00.689 --> 00:40:03.275
-Over there?
-Yeah, I know. It looks scary.

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:06.278
That was scary. This is wood.

00:40:09.156 --> 00:40:11.700
Just wait there. Give us a minute.

00:40:22.711 --> 00:40:24.463
There's probably more ahead.

00:40:25.631 --> 00:40:27.174
So, we'll deal with it then.

00:40:28.134 --> 00:40:29.885
I got it. I got it.

00:40:33.848 --> 00:40:35.558
What about the kid?

00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:37.643
I mean, maybe the first bite didn't take,

00:40:37.726 --> 00:40:40.312
-but what about the second?
-How 'bout you just take the good news?

00:40:41.647 --> 00:40:42.773
Can you do that?

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.402
Like to think, for once,
maybe we could actually win?

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:50.447
Just go, go and watch her.

00:41:15.347 --> 00:41:16.891
Is it everything you hoped for?

00:41:18.184 --> 00:41:19.727
Jury's still out.

00:41:21.937 --> 00:41:24.481
But, man, you can't deny that view.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.324
C'mon, let's get there before it's dark.

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:53.028
Where the fuck are they?

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:35.070
Stay back.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.354
Joel?

00:44:09.104 --> 00:44:11.357
-What the fuck is going on?
-I don't know.

00:44:16.445 --> 00:44:18.405
They went inside.

00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:24.370
-Come on.
-Tess.

00:44:24.453 --> 00:44:25.537
Come on!

00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:26.747
Tess!

00:44:32.795 --> 00:44:34.797
EXIT

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.718
Holy shit.

00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:43.472
Jesus.

00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:54.066
Okay.

00:44:54.149 --> 00:44:58.112
I mean, there's gotta be
a fuckin' radio or somethin', right?

00:45:00.906 --> 00:45:02.658
Who killed them? FEDRA?

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:04.785
No.

00:45:07.246 --> 00:45:08.872
One of them got bit.

00:45:08.956 --> 00:45:10.916
The healthy ones fought the sick ones.
Everyone lost.

00:45:10.999 --> 00:45:13.544
Tess? What're you doin'?

00:45:14.086 --> 00:45:16.713
Where did Marlene say
that she was taking you?

00:45:16.797 --> 00:45:19.258
-Ellie!
-I don't know. Just west.

00:45:19.341 --> 00:45:20.926
Just west. Fuck. Okay.

00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:24.888
Well, I mean, one of them's gotta have
a map on them, right?

00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:27.099
-Joel, can ya help me?
-No!

00:45:27.182 --> 00:45:29.768
Tess, it's over.

00:45:29.852 --> 00:45:33.647
-We are going home.
-That's not my fucking home!

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:49.621
I'm stayin'.

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:55.127
I mean, our luck had to run out
sooner or later.

00:45:56.628 --> 00:45:58.172
Fuck.

00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:00.674
She's infected.

00:46:08.849 --> 00:46:09.975
Show me.

00:46:11.894 --> 00:46:13.020
Joel.

00:46:26.408 --> 00:46:28.160
Oops, right?

00:46:35.876 --> 00:46:37.794
Take your bandage off.

00:46:43.342 --> 00:46:44.468
Look.

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:46.261
Joel?

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.556
This is real.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.642
Joel, she's fucking real.

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:56.563
I need you to get her
to Bill and Frank's.

00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:58.106
-No.
-They'll take her off your hands.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:59.483
-No.
-They'll handle it from here.

00:46:59.566 --> 00:47:00.776
No, no, no, I can't. They won't take her.

00:47:00.859 --> 00:47:03.111
-They're not gonna take her.
-They will 'cause you'll convince them.

00:47:03.195 --> 00:47:04.321
Yes, you will.

00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:06.240
I never ask you for anything,

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:07.866
-not to feel the way I felt.
-No.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:09.701
Shut the fuck up 'cause I don't have time.

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:11.870
This is your chance.

00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:14.414
You get her there,

00:47:15.123 --> 00:47:16.667
you keep her alive,

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.587
and you set everything right.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.050
All the shit we did.

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.928
Please say yes, Joel, please.

00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:29.930
Oh fuck!

00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:21.023
-How many?
-All of them.

00:48:21.106 --> 00:48:22.107
Maybe a minute.

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:38.081
-What are you doing?
-Making sure that they don't follow you.

00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:53.055
Joel.

00:48:57.017 --> 00:48:58.935
Save who you can save.

00:49:07.527 --> 00:49:08.445
No!

00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:10.989
We're not leaving her!

00:49:11.073 --> 00:49:12.741
Get off me, you fucker!

00:49:12.824 --> 00:49:14.284
I'm not going with you!
