- Just look at you!

To sort out the real problem I missed
while taking care of the wrong person.

00:20:22.177 --> 00:20:24.497
Can I ask who you are?

00:20:31.007 --> 00:20:34.457
Are you a little curious about that now?

00:20:34.457 --> 00:20:37.397
I couldn't think straight earlier.

00:20:38.397 --> 00:20:42.007
And now that the situation
is especially very serious.

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:46.097
Does someone who knows how
serious it is roaming around like that?

00:20:46.097 --> 00:20:48.037
Are you on vacation or something?

00:20:48.037 --> 00:20:50.547
Why the heck did you go inside a club?

00:20:50.547 --> 00:20:52.397
That's because...

00:20:58.287 --> 00:21:00.577
What about you?

00:21:01.217 --> 00:21:07.797
Who are you that you know this place and this

Right?

00:21:31.047 --> 00:21:33.287
You're the one who hit me with that car.

00:21:35.267 --> 00:21:40.137
I don't know how distracted you
were that you only figured that out now.

car, but it's a time machine.

Even looking at this, you can say that?

00:22:20.607 --> 00:22:24.007
Isn't it correct to say I
didn't create this situation?

00:22:28.337 --> 00:22:34.137

did I think this was only my problem?

No, you don't seem to understand very well.

you even followed me here.

This is just a trip, and the time where
