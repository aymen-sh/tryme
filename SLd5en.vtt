01:38.590 --> 01:40.620
What are you doing there?

01:42.080 --> 01:43.890
I'll ask again.

01:44.550 --> 01:46.790
What do you think you're doing?

01:50.150 --> 01:53.510
<i>That was careless. 
What was I even thinking?</i>

01:54.600 --> 01:57.710
I got lost and ended up here.

01:57.710 --> 02:01.290
You got lost? Are you with the mining team?

02:01.290 --> 02:04.080
This is the boss room. Get clear.

02:04.570 --> 02:08.390
<i>Cha Hae-in... The rumors about her 
weren't exaggerating.</i>

02:08.390 --> 02:10.940
<i>I didn't notice she was there 
until she spoke up.</i>

02:13.000 --> 02:14.430
<i>Was I seeing things?</i>

02:14.430 --> 02:16.620
<i>Didn't he have a weapon a moment ago?</i>

02:16.620 --> 02:17.620
Sorry.

02:18.060 --> 02:20.230
You need to leave this area right away.

02:20.230 --> 02:24.710
If you were to agitate the boss right now, 
the entire mining team could be wiped out.

02:24.710 --> 02:25.710
Understood.

02:33.730 --> 02:35.010
Hey, wait a second!

02:35.630 --> 02:36.640
Yes?

02:43.450 --> 02:45.520
<i>He doesn't... stink.</i>

02:46.030 --> 02:47.880
What are you doing?

02:47.880 --> 02:50.520
Are you really a hunter?

02:51.100 --> 02:52.830
Well, yes.

02:54.740 --> 02:58.030
<i>Sung Jinwoo... an E-Rank.</i>

03:01.180 --> 03:02.710
It's not important.

03:02.710 --> 03:06.390
Just be careful on your way back. 
This is quite a large dungeon.

03:06.390 --> 03:07.500
Got it.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.960
<i>Is it because of his low rank?</i>

03:13.410 --> 03:14.920
<i>He didn't smell bad.</i>

03:17.120 --> 03:20.340
<i>If anything... he smelled good.</i>

03:21.750 --> 03:24.770
So you got lost and ran into Hunter Cha?

03:24.770 --> 03:26.610
You're a lucky fellow.

03:26.610 --> 03:30.320
The rest of us have to settle for 
admiring her from a distance.

03:31.710 --> 03:38.030
She's been patrolling every day during break 
time to protect us from the dungeon boss.

03:38.410 --> 03:40.570
She's young, but she's got her act together.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.790
<i>That's why she was by the boss room.</i>

03:43.660 --> 03:47.610
She apparently doesn't like 
the way other hunters smell.

03:47.610 --> 03:50.250
The way they... smell?

03:50.250 --> 03:52.630
Some unique condition of hers.

03:52.630 --> 03:55.820
Notice how she's always covering 
her nose with that handkerchief?

03:55.820 --> 03:57.380
Right...

03:57.380 --> 03:59.180
<i>But the way she reacted to me...</i>

04:01.180 --> 04:04.390
<i>Maybe I don't have the typical hunter scent?</i>

04:05.150 --> 04:08.920
<i>Come to think of it, the boss of the 
red gate said something similar.</i>

04:09.520 --> 04:11.690
<i>Is it because I'm the Player?</i>

04:13.040 --> 04:16.090
<i>Having the system's assistance does 
set me apart from everyone else...</i>

04:16.470 --> 04:19.440
<i>But what even is the Player, really?</i>

04:20.530 --> 04:22.310
Good work today.

04:22.310 --> 04:23.740
Thank you.

04:24.420 --> 04:26.390
You helped us finish early.

04:26.750 --> 04:29.960
Can't believe we wrapped up 
faster than the collection team.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.180
You're definitely a natural at this job.

04:32.180 --> 04:35.340
I thought you had an excavator 
hidden somewhere a few times.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.260
Oh, come on.

04:37.260 --> 04:39.250
I've been doing this for a long time,

04:39.250 --> 04:42.390
and I've never seen anyone 
with the knack for it like you.

04:45.420 --> 04:48.520
Mr. Sung, would you like 
to come and work for me?

04:49.060 --> 04:50.880
I'll ensure you're paid well!

04:50.880 --> 04:53.980
Oh, no, I appreciate the offer, but...

04:53.980 --> 04:56.510
I only came in because I had some spare time.

04:57.140 --> 04:59.950
I see. That's a real shame.

05:00.490 --> 05:03.740
How about coming in for 
just one more day, then?

05:03.740 --> 05:05.150
One more day?

05:05.150 --> 05:09.910
You see, tomorrow's a double-header 
for raids—one A-Rank, one C-Rank.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.670
<i>My reassessment is the day after tomorrow.</i>

05:12.670 --> 05:15.880
<i>I was able to earn the money I needed 
with today's work, so...</i>

05:16.390 --> 05:18.090
<i>Wait, tomorrow?</i>

05:18.800 --> 05:23.110
There's two Hunters Guild raids tomorrow? 
For both A and C Rank?

05:23.110 --> 05:27.520
Yes. That said, there'll be a secondary 
strike team showing up tomorrow.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.810
Two teams?

05:29.220 --> 05:31.640
That's one of our strengths.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.780
There aren't many domestic guilds 
who can dedicate two teams

05:34.780 --> 05:37.250
to taking down A-Rank gates.

05:37.910 --> 05:40.260
So where should I go tomorrow?

05:40.880 --> 05:42.820
You'll come in, then?

05:43.200 --> 05:46.250
I'll make sure you get paid 
double the usual rate, then!

05:46.250 --> 05:48.210
Whoa, I don't know if that's....

05:48.210 --> 05:51.040
Don't you worry about it! 
I'd feel guilty otherwise.

05:54.170 --> 05:59.620
Could you look up the details on Sung Jinwoo, 
who worked on the mining team today?

05:59.620 --> 06:01.220
<i>Hunter Sung?</i>

06:01.580 --> 06:03.200
You know of him?

06:03.200 --> 06:07.660
<i>Well, Guildmaster Choi asked me 
to do the same thing.</i>

06:07.660 --> 06:09.060
The guild master?

06:09.060 --> 06:13.570
<i>Right. But his current details are unavailable.</i>

06:14.320 --> 06:17.820
<i>The Association has a lock on his file, 
even though he's not a top-level hunter.</i>

06:17.820 --> 06:19.290
<i>Never seen anything like it.</i>

06:19.760 --> 06:21.180
I see.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.090
<i>The way he was acting in the dungeon...</i>

06:27.090 --> 06:29.410
<i>The fact that Guildmaster Choi 
wanted him looked into...</i>

06:29.410 --> 06:31.410
<i>The Association's involvement...</i>

06:32.200 --> 06:34.330
<i>Something's going on here.</i>

06:35.210 --> 06:37.540
<i>I've met so many hunters, but...</i>

06:38.980 --> 06:43.100
He's the first one who smelled good.

06:48.430 --> 06:50.010
Hey, there you are!

06:50.320 --> 06:51.510
Mr. Sung!

06:51.510 --> 06:53.130
Good morning.

06:55.450 --> 06:58.150
<i>Hey, kid. You eat before coming in?</i>

06:58.560 --> 07:00.020
<i>Hello there, Sung.</i>

07:00.610 --> 07:03.690
<i>Jinwoo, try not to get hurt today, okay?</i>

07:07.470 --> 07:10.570
<i>This feeling... 
I'd forgotten what it was like.</i>

07:11.120 --> 07:13.900
Let's eat lunch together today.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.020
Yeah, since you're here and all.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.020
Sure.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.470
All right! First is the C-Rank dungeon!

07:19.470 --> 07:22.510
The strike team should be coming 
out soon! Everybody get ready!

07:25.480 --> 07:27.550
Impressive again.

07:30.140 --> 07:33.470
The work just gets done faster 
with Sung around.

07:33.470 --> 07:37.390
Thanks to him, we can get plenty of rest 
before the A-Rank dungeon in the afternoon.

07:37.390 --> 07:42.650
The collection team was surprised, too. 
Sure you don't want to come work with us?

07:42.650 --> 07:44.050
I'll pay you five times as much!

07:44.710 --> 07:46.200
Sorry...

07:46.200 --> 07:47.250
Excuse me.

07:49.050 --> 07:50.570
Captain Son Kihoon.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.730
Do you have anyone I can borrow from mining?

07:54.730 --> 07:57.450
Our equipment carrier didn't show.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.280
From us?

07:59.280 --> 08:01.790
Wouldn't someone from the 
collection team be better?

08:01.790 --> 08:04.680
They're apparently short-staffed, too.

08:06.470 --> 08:10.650
Since you'll be accompanying the strike team, 
you'll also get hazard pay.

08:12.830 --> 08:16.730
Low-rank hunters can't handle carrying 
equipment in A-Rank dungeons, sir.

08:17.110 --> 08:19.270
It's not a problem money can solve.

08:20.740 --> 08:23.040
No one at all...?

08:24.230 --> 08:25.570
I'll do it.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.030
Whoa, Mr. Sung!

08:30.030 --> 08:31.510
That's crazy!

08:31.510 --> 08:33.900
There'll be high-ranked beasts in there!

08:33.900 --> 08:36.720
The pay won't be worth the risk!

08:36.720 --> 08:38.120
It's okay.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.250
I'm braver than I look.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.340
It's not a question of courage...

08:43.900 --> 08:47.970
This guy only started yesterday. 
He doesn't really understand.

08:47.970 --> 08:48.980
What's his rank?

08:48.980 --> 08:50.680
E-Rank.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.180
So you should find someone—

08:52.180 --> 08:54.530
No, I'd like him to do it.

08:57.190 --> 09:01.480
I'm Son Kihoon, the head of the strike team.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.990
I'm Sung Jinwoo.

09:05.220 --> 09:07.470
The gate's bigger than the one from yesterday.

09:07.470 --> 09:10.860
It has less magic power coming
from it, though.

09:10.860 --> 09:12.660
Don't worry.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.400
We belong to the secondary team,

09:14.400 --> 09:16.830
so they wouldn't leave anything 
seriously dangerous to us.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.250
<i>Six A-Ranks...</i>

09:19.530 --> 09:21.070
<i>and three B-Ranks.</i>

09:21.670 --> 09:23.470
<i>There might not be any S-Ranks,</i>

09:23.470 --> 09:27.840
<i>but no other guild would have people 
like this in a secondary team.</i>

09:28.670 --> 09:30.050
Let's get going.

09:31.380 --> 09:35.470
<i>The Hunters Guild can field 
</i>two<i> teams of this level?</i>

09:43.180 --> 09:46.230
<i>There really is less magic power in the air 
than yesterday's dungeon.</i>

09:46.600 --> 09:47.690
<i>But it's weird.</i>

09:48.410 --> 09:52.080
<i>I'm getting the same bad feeling from 
when I went through the red gate.</i>

09:52.080 --> 09:53.660
<i>Probably just my imagination.</i>

09:54.020 --> 09:55.960
No need to be nervous.

09:56.650 --> 10:01.960
Kihoon—er, the captain and all 
the other hunters here are strong.

10:02.300 --> 10:06.460
As long as you don't run off, you won't 
be attacked by a magic beast.

10:07.110 --> 10:08.670
That's good to know.

10:09.450 --> 10:13.630
<i>Once this raid is over, 
I'll officially make captain.</i>

10:14.080 --> 10:16.710
<i>I might not be as strong as the 
guild master or vice guild master,</i>

10:16.710 --> 10:18.950
<i>but I'm an A-Rank hunter.</i>

10:18.950 --> 10:20.520
<i>I can handle this!</i>

10:26.530 --> 10:28.770
<i>They got ready to fight without any direction.</i>

10:33.440 --> 10:34.510
Here they come!

10:40.410 --> 10:41.900
Dungeon jackals!

10:54.330 --> 10:55.390
Get down!

11:07.360 --> 11:09.930
What are dungeon jackals 
doing in an A-Rank dungeon?

11:10.660 --> 11:13.010
Do they not show up usually?

11:13.530 --> 11:16.200
They're C-Rank magic beasts.

11:16.550 --> 11:19.620
They shouldn't be able to survive in here.

11:21.690 --> 11:22.930
Collars?

11:23.430 --> 11:26.290
Look at this. Maybe they belong to someone.

11:26.650 --> 11:29.870
So they were kept alive as hunting dogs?

11:36.270 --> 11:38.890
<i>This explains the bad feeling I had.</i>

11:48.460 --> 11:49.830
High orcs?

11:49.830 --> 11:50.940
Why are they here?!

12:05.780 --> 12:07.410
<i>So powerful!</i>

12:14.840 --> 12:16.790
My taunt skill didn't work?!

12:16.790 --> 12:19.130
It's targeting the back line! Look out!

12:21.800 --> 12:23.760
I'm not going down that easy!

12:28.170 --> 12:31.270
No effect at all?! 
How high is its magic resistance?!

12:43.530 --> 12:47.840
It's too strong! I can only keep it 
pinned down for a few seconds!

12:47.840 --> 12:49.330
I'll send reinforcements!

12:50.000 --> 12:51.990
You, who my voice awakens...

12:53.470 --> 12:55.360
Collect the head of my foe!

12:59.760 --> 13:02.600
<i>This spell is my secret weapon, 
and it costs a ton of mana!</i>

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
<i>How's that?!</i>

13:16.020 --> 13:17.150
Healer!

13:17.150 --> 13:18.230
We need help over here!

13:18.230 --> 13:20.160
Hang on! I'll be there soon!

13:21.150 --> 13:22.730
There's too many of them!

13:22.730 --> 13:24.700
If we get surrounded, we'll be in real trouble!

13:24.980 --> 13:27.870
Split into groups of three, and spread out!

13:28.470 --> 13:31.290
<i>Even one high orc is a match for 
A-Rank hunters... and there's so many.</i>

13:31.820 --> 13:34.990
<i>The B-Ranks don't stand a chance!</i>

13:40.060 --> 13:42.430
<i>Come on, people, stay with me!</i>

13:52.630 --> 13:53.730
Next!

13:53.730 --> 13:56.710
Don't move! I'll heal you right away!

14:37.900 --> 14:40.360
<i>What... just happened?</i>

14:47.870 --> 14:49.200
What is this?

14:50.070 --> 14:52.630
<i>They're suddenly moving slower.</i>

14:53.470 --> 14:54.320
Now!

14:54.320 --> 14:56.290
Push them all the way back!

14:56.750 --> 15:01.590
<i>Hate to butt in as an outsider, 
but I can't just let them die.</i>

15:07.920 --> 15:10.310
<i>I'll weaken the enemies 
without anyone noticing.</i>

15:13.630 --> 15:15.230
You stay out of this.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.590
Is anyone seriously injured?!

15:56.590 --> 15:58.530
Looks okay over here.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.900
It's a miracle no one was hurt.

16:01.410 --> 16:04.730
Did you notice anything weird during combat?

16:04.730 --> 16:08.130
The one I was fighting started 
moving sluggishly all of a sudden.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.700
Was that you, Gina?

16:10.430 --> 16:12.280
I couldn't do that if I wanted to.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.620
I've only got attack magic and 
a little bit of telekinesis magic.

16:16.620 --> 16:19.690
And the other mages are all firepower-focused.

16:19.690 --> 16:23.890
We don't have any stealth types, 
so none of us should be capable of that.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.940
But however it happened, we still won.

16:27.940 --> 16:31.260
Good point. Let's chalk it up to good luck.

16:32.930 --> 16:37.010
<i>That equipment carrier must think we're a joke.</i>

16:37.010 --> 16:41.840
<i>All these magic casters, and he really believed
no one would notice him using Stealth?</i>

16:42.480 --> 16:46.170
<i>On the other hand, 
he did help us out of a tight spot.</i>

16:46.170 --> 16:49.570
<i>I'm sure he has his reasons, 
so I'll pretend I didn't see anything.</i>

16:50.090 --> 16:53.280
Captain Son, should we keep going?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.550
This is too dangerous for our strike team.

16:57.550 --> 17:01.790
We'd need at least two more healers 
and another three mages.

17:02.370 --> 17:05.710
I know this isn't what you wanted
for your first time as captain,

17:05.710 --> 17:08.790
but I really think we should withdraw.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.800
<i>I get why he wouldn't want to give up.</i>

17:15.290 --> 17:17.560
<i>He obviously wants to clear this dungeon.</i>

17:17.870 --> 17:20.660
<i>But if he's reasonable...</i>

17:21.420 --> 17:25.130
Then let's pull out for now.

17:27.570 --> 17:30.660
I was worried you'd wanna 
keep going, to be honest.

17:30.660 --> 17:33.030
I'm not that stupid.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.880
Wh-What the...

17:36.380 --> 17:39.060
It's a barrier. And a powerful one, at that.

17:39.610 --> 17:41.580
It wasn't there when we came this way.

17:42.030 --> 17:43.000
Can you dispel it?

17:43.540 --> 17:45.540
I think so, with enough time.

17:46.760 --> 17:51.010
<i>If there's something in the dungeon 
capable of this kind of magic...</i>

17:51.600 --> 17:53.520
<i>then turning back was the right call.</i>

17:53.520 --> 17:56.970
<i>We can't possibly clear this place.</i>

17:59.260 --> 18:01.140
Where is this magic power coming from?!

18:01.520 --> 18:02.830
No way...

18:02.830 --> 18:04.310
Was that the dungeon boss?

18:04.310 --> 18:06.020
Help me out here! We have to hurry!

18:06.320 --> 18:07.050
Got it!

18:07.050 --> 18:07.910
Right!

18:08.190 --> 18:11.860
<i>Enough magic power that even 
B-Rank hunters can detect it...</i>

18:11.860 --> 18:14.540
<i>Then why couldn't anyone 
sense it from the outside?</i>

18:20.620 --> 18:22.410
A curse?! It must be a trap!

18:22.410 --> 18:24.620
Semi! We need holy magic!

18:25.990 --> 18:27.750
What's wrong?! Why aren't you—

18:34.920 --> 18:37.930
Kihoon... I see at least fifty of them.

18:39.040 --> 18:39.790
Kihoon!

18:39.790 --> 18:40.820
Stay back!

18:41.770 --> 18:44.110
If we fight, we die.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.160
<i>Humans.</i>

19:15.750 --> 19:18.300
<i>I am called Kargalgan.</i>

19:18.300 --> 19:21.510
<i>I would like to meet with you.</i>

19:22.010 --> 19:25.410
Kargalgan, are you the one 
who blocked off our exit?

19:26.000 --> 19:31.470
<i>That is right. 
I am a proud orcish master of curses.</i>

19:31.470 --> 19:35.590
Is there anyone more powerful 
than you in this cave?

19:37.680 --> 19:41.330
<i>Do you think any exist who could surpass me?</i>

19:41.640 --> 19:48.500
<i>Now choose. Will you be killed 
by my soldiers or come to me?</i>

19:51.280 --> 19:52.710
We'll meet with you.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.060
Hunter Sung.

20:02.060 --> 20:03.220
Yes?

20:04.830 --> 20:08.190
We're going to attack 
as soon as the boss appears.

20:08.690 --> 20:09.990
However that turns out,

20:09.990 --> 20:13.340
he likely won't be able to maintain 
the barrier while dealing with us.

20:13.340 --> 20:16.680
That'll be your chance to leave the dungeon 
and contact the main strike team.

20:17.110 --> 20:18.860
Don't tell me you plan to die here.

20:20.500 --> 20:24.440
Our objective isn't 
to leave this dungeon alive,

20:24.440 --> 20:26.120
but to make sure the gate closes.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.710
I have a request, too.

20:29.740 --> 20:33.980
It's not long, but this is my will. 
Please take it to my family.

20:34.950 --> 20:40.260
This is what we're trained to do, 
but you have no such duty.

20:40.830 --> 20:43.720
Please try and get out of here alive.

20:44.160 --> 20:48.790
<i>This sense of despair... 
It reminds me of the double dungeon.</i>

20:49.560 --> 20:51.430
<i>Back then, the others abandoned me.</i>

20:52.330 --> 20:54.460
But these people...

20:54.990 --> 20:59.030
I'll hold onto it. 
But hopefully that won't be necessary.

21:06.350 --> 21:10.500
<i>I don't see him. Did he quit mining work?</i>

21:11.660 --> 21:13.090
Hunter Cha?

21:13.960 --> 21:16.900
What brings you by? Aren't you off today?

21:16.900 --> 21:20.620
Um, is that man, Sung Jinwoo, around today?

21:20.620 --> 21:26.230
Oh, Sung's actually helping out 
as a carrier today.

21:26.230 --> 21:27.520
Then...

21:28.020 --> 21:30.520
He's inside of the gate?

21:56.730 --> 22:03.470
I bid you welcome, human worms.
