<b>You're late!</b>

00:23.520 --> 00:26.650
<b>You're so fussy.
Who cares if I'm a little late?</b>

You can't put the detergent in the fridge!</b>

00:37.780 --> 00:39.660
<b>Fussing again.</b>

00:39.740 --> 00:42.870
<b>Just put it all on the shelves,

00:42.950 --> 00:44.960
<b>You can't stuff everything in one place!</b>

00:45.750 --> 00:48.080
<b>I bet you've never even had a job before.</b>

00:48.170 --> 00:50.000
<b>-I have too!
-What'd you do?</b>

00:50.090 --> 00:51.840
<b>I helped out with my dad's work!</b>

00:52.670 --> 00:56.220
<b><i>I dug a huge hole and tossed</i>

<b>Mr. Sakamoto, we have to fire her!</b>

<b>Mr. Sakamoto?</b>

01:21.660 --> 01:23.830
<b>What's wrong, you two?</b>

01:23.910 --> 01:28.210

<b>Mr. Manager is chattier than I thought.</b>

<b>I worked with him for years.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.230
<b>He barely talks in his own mind.</b>

01:45.310 --> 01:49.350
<b>Do you two think that I'm some kind of
talking blob of meat?</b>

01:49.440 --> 01:50.610
<b>How rude.</b>

01:51.230 --> 01:52.190

<b>WELCOME TO SUGAR PARK</b>

03:53.270 --> 03:56.810
<b>Well, what a surprise!
A doppelgänger, perhaps?</b>

04:15.880 --> 04:17.750
<b>Long time no see, Nagumo.</b>

04:19.460 --> 04:21.710
<b>I see you've still got it, Sakamoto.</b>

04:21.800 --> 04:23.840
<b>Thank goodness for that.</b>

04:23.930 --> 04:26.010
<b><i>How did he do that with his face?</i></b>

04:26.090 --> 04:27.100
<b><i>And…</i></b>

04:27.180 --> 04:28.810
<b><i>Why can't I read his mind?</i></b>

04:39.940 --> 04:43.740
<b>Sorry, didn't think that

<b>Mr. Sakamoto, who is this guy?</b>

04:46.240 --> 04:47.870
<b>Let's stuff him in a sack!</b>

04:48.490 --> 04:49.990
<b>My name is Nagumo.</b>

04:50.080 --> 04:53.710
<b>I work at the supermarket across

<b>A friend? And you're only 18?</b>

04:58.960 --> 05:01.500
<b>But there's no supermarket

05:01.590 --> 05:04.010
<b>He's a hit man.

<b>He's 27.</b>

05:05.550 --> 05:07.340
<b>Everything you said was a lie!</b>

05:07.430 --> 05:08.800
<b>We aren't that gullible!</b>

05:09.930 --> 05:13.100
<b>There's a bounty on Sakamoto's head.</b>

05:13.180 --> 05:14.890
<b>The reward is one billion yen.</b>

05:14.980 --> 05:16.350
<b>I'm sure it's just another lie.</b>

05:16.940 --> 05:19.230
<b>The "one billion yen" makes it so obvious.</b>

05:19.310 --> 05:21.110
<b>I know kids that are better liars.</b>

05:21.190 --> 05:22.570
<b>Nope, it's true.</b>

05:23.190 --> 05:26.700
<b>It was officially decided by the JAA,

05:27.320 --> 05:29.700
<b>It won't be posted online

<b>Can't believe you let me,

<b>You little--</b>

<b>Nagumo, wait.</b>

06:36.770 --> 06:40.520
<b>Don't tell me you're gonna try

06:40.600 --> 06:44.690
<b>Do you really think you stand a chance

06:44.770 --> 06:47.280
<b>Or worse, against <i>us?</i></b>

06:49.780 --> 06:51.110
<b>Just kidding.</b>

06:51.200 --> 06:53.320
<b>We'll stay out of it this time.</b>

<b>No clue.</b>

07:10.050 --> 07:12.720
<b>We just complete our missions.</b>

07:13.470 --> 07:17.010
<b>And you know, for someone who's retired,
you've drawn a lot of attention.</b>

07:17.100 --> 07:19.310
<b>Eliminating Dan, Inc.? That was too far.</b>

07:19.390 --> 07:20.520
<b>Are you stupid?</b>

07:20.600 --> 07:22.850
<b>Are there gonna be more guys like them?</b>

07:22.940 --> 07:26.150
<b>Oh, no! No more noobs like that.</b>

07:26.860 --> 07:28.940
<b>Well, anyway…</b>

07:30.570 --> 07:32.660
<b>Good seeing you, Sakamoto.</b>

07:32.740 --> 07:34.820

<b>on our side?</b>

<b>Well… There goes our pizza guy.</b>

07:51.920 --> 07:54.970
<b>I can't believe this fat-ass is

07:55.050 --> 07:57.970
<b>That black-haired guy looked way worse.</b>

07:58.060 --> 08:00.480
<b>Oh, who cares about that.</b>

08:01.060 --> 08:04.230
<b>Shouldn't you be more worried

08:04.310 --> 08:05.480
<b>What'd you say?</b>

08:05.560 --> 08:08.980
<b>Sorry, never mind.

08:09.070 --> 08:11.360
<b>Hey, anyone feel like pizza?</b>

08:11.440 --> 08:13.950
<b>You're underestimating Sakamoto.</b>

08:14.700 --> 08:17.280
<b>You have to outsmart him in every way.</b>

08:17.370 --> 08:19.040
<b>Time, place, everything.</b>

08:19.700 --> 08:22.710
<b>Find the worst possible moment for him

<b>That's how we do it at Dondenkai.</b>

08:26.580 --> 08:28.710
<b>He used to be in The Order.</b>

08:28.790 --> 08:30.880
<b>If you're not careful,

08:31.710 --> 08:34.970
<b>The Order? That's an urban myth.</b>

08:35.050 --> 08:38.890
<b>He retired five years ago, right?

08:38.970 --> 08:40.970
<b><i>One piece of advice.</i></b>

<b>He knew the camera was there?</b>

<b>Giving off quite a vibe, huh.</b>

08:58.660 --> 09:00.580
<b>-Arcade?
-Sounds good!</b>

09:02.250 --> 09:04.580
<b>If what Nagumo said was true,</b>

<b>A little too much for me.</b>

10:18.570 --> 10:21.410
<b>I think I had too many frankfurters.</b>

10:21.490 --> 10:22.990
<b>I'll call for a doctor!</b>

10:23.080 --> 10:26.000
<b>Don't be so dramatic. Want some water?</b>

<b>how are we gonna weed out the enemies?</b>

<b>There aren't any enemies near us.</b>

<b><i>Under the right conditions,</i></b>

13:47.610 --> 13:48.450
<b><i>It's so tight.</i></b>

13:50.030 --> 13:54.750
<b>Please do not remove the safety bar
while the ride is in motion.</b>

13:54.830 --> 13:56.460
<b>Enjoy your journey!</b>

13:56.540 --> 13:58.250
<b>Off you go!</b>

13:59.460 --> 14:01.960
<b>-Why are we sitting all the way back here?
-Enjoy!</b>

14:02.040 --> 14:04.260
<b>It'll be easier to spot enemies.</b>

14:04.340 --> 14:06.970
<b>The back of the ride is faster, too.</b>

14:07.050 --> 14:09.470
<b>It's the same speed.</b>

14:09.550 --> 14:11.140
<b>See anyone suspicious?</b>

14:12.810 --> 14:15.520
<b>Doesn't seem like anyone's
got murder on the mind.</b>

14:15.600 --> 14:18.480
<b>Who would choose a time like this, anyway?</b>

14:19.480 --> 14:22.230
<b>Wait, that guy with the silver hair
looks suspicious.</b>

14:22.310 --> 14:23.150
<b>Really?</b>

14:23.230 --> 14:25.650
<b>I dunno, he's not thinking about anything.</b>

14:25.730 --> 14:28.490
<b>Look at him, there's no way he's normal.</b>

14:28.570 --> 14:29.660
<b>Hey.</b>

14:29.740 --> 14:31.740
<b>You can't judge a book by its cover.</b>

14:31.820 --> 14:35.830
<b><i>Hey, they noticed me.</i>
<i>Was I giving off a vibe without realizing?</i></b>

14:36.870 --> 14:37.910
<b><i>Shit!</i></b>

14:39.080 --> 14:40.290
<b>What are you doing?</b>

14:40.370 --> 14:42.290
<b>Removing this safety bar!</b>

14:42.380 --> 14:44.630
<b>What? But we're at the top…</b>

14:44.710 --> 14:47.170
<b>Mr. Sakamoto, an enemy got past us!</b>

14:48.090 --> 14:50.470
<b><i>Three rows behind you,</i>
<i>the guy with the silver hair!</i></b>

14:57.640 --> 14:58.680
<b><i>Damn.</i></b>

14:58.770 --> 15:00.770
<b><i>Bulletproof glasses, huh?</i></b>

15:00.850 --> 15:03.190
<b><i>I guess it couldn't be that easy.</i></b>

15:03.270 --> 15:05.690
<b>Mr. Sakamoto, I'll take care of him!</b>

15:06.780 --> 15:08.740
<b>What? Are you crazy?</b>

15:08.820 --> 15:11.280
<b>We're coming to the loop!</b>

15:13.450 --> 15:14.280
<b>Hey!</b>

15:33.840 --> 15:35.890
<b>I need to have a word with you!</b>

15:47.520 --> 15:48.860
<b>That was close.</b>

15:53.360 --> 15:55.490
<b>Are you out of your mind?</b>

15:55.570 --> 15:57.530
<b>You could've killed me.</b>

15:58.370 --> 16:00.790
<b>Today's Mr. Sakamoto's day off.</b>

16:00.870 --> 16:03.250
<b>Looks like I'll have to do some overtime.</b>

16:03.750 --> 16:06.670
<b>Hmm? What kinda vibe is that?</b>

16:09.130 --> 16:12.220
<b><i>Damn it, I can't read him at all.</i></b>

16:12.300 --> 16:13.970
<b><i>He's not making this easy.</i></b>

16:21.520 --> 16:23.020
<b>Aw, you noticed.</b>

16:29.360 --> 16:30.780
<b><i>I can't dodge them both!</i></b>

16:47.040 --> 16:48.920
<b><i>He uses poison?</i></b>

16:49.960 --> 16:52.090
<b>Strong stuff, isn't it?</b>

16:52.170 --> 16:55.050
<b>It's a special blend I made myself.</b>

16:56.090 --> 16:58.220
<b>So, you're probably going to die now.</b>

16:58.300 --> 16:59.560
<b>How's that feel?</b>

16:59.640 --> 17:03.560
<b>Shut up, dumbass. This is far from over.</b>

17:03.640 --> 17:06.150
<b>See, that's the thing.</b>

17:06.230 --> 17:09.190
<b>I noticed this with Sakamoto earlier, too.</b>

17:09.270 --> 17:11.940
<b><i>Those are losers' eyes.</i></b>

17:12.030 --> 17:14.450
<b><i>He fears death.</i></b>

17:16.530 --> 17:18.410
<b>You're just talking gibberish.</b>

17:20.200 --> 17:23.830
<b>You can see it in their eyes
when someone isn't prepared to face death.</b>

17:23.910 --> 17:28.830
<b>The harder you cling to life,
the weaker you become, you know?</b>

17:28.920 --> 17:33.960
<b>That pesky desire to live
delays critical split-second decisions.</b>

17:34.050 --> 17:35.340
<b>Just like yours did.</b>

17:35.420 --> 17:40.140
<b><i>You were petrified by the knives,</i>
<i>and so, you couldn't dodge both of them.</i></b>

17:42.470 --> 17:44.480
<b>You don't know anything.</b>

17:44.560 --> 17:47.480
<b>Mr. Sakamoto is afraid of death?</b>

17:47.560 --> 17:48.900
<b>Of course he is.</b>

17:48.980 --> 17:53.320
<b>He has to protect his family
for the rest of his life.</b>

17:53.940 --> 17:57.240
<b>It's the hardest mission he's ever had.</b>

17:58.160 --> 18:00.950
<b>People fight harder</b>

18:01.030 --> 18:03.790
<b>when they have something to protect!</b>

18:04.540 --> 18:08.330
<b>Yeah, yeah.
You're practically blind right now, right?</b>

18:08.420 --> 18:11.040
<b>This desperate vibe thing is annoying.</b>

18:11.130 --> 18:13.550
<b>It doesn't matter if I can't see!</b>

18:13.630 --> 18:16.800
<b>There's only one path here, anyway.</b>

18:19.550 --> 18:20.930
<b>What terrible timing.</b>

18:23.220 --> 18:25.140
<b><i>Why'd he jump so low?</i></b>

18:33.360 --> 18:35.320
<b>Okay, now it's getting interesting!</b>

18:35.400 --> 18:37.570
<b>So? What next?</b>

18:37.650 --> 18:39.400
<b>Shut up!</b>

18:45.490 --> 18:46.660
<b><i>Damn it!</i></b>

18:46.750 --> 18:48.160
<b><i>There's gotta be something.</i></b>

18:48.250 --> 18:49.670
<b><i>Some way to come out on top…</i></b>

18:49.750 --> 18:51.630
<b><i>-Where are they?</i>
<i>-That ride looks fun.</i></b>

18:51.710 --> 18:52.920
<b><i>I gotta contact them.</i></b>

18:53.880 --> 18:55.500
<b><i>Can we see Sugar Bunny soon?</i></b>

19:05.010 --> 19:06.930
<b><i>Popcorn's delicious.</i></b>

19:15.520 --> 19:16.940
<b>Oh, no, everyone!</b>

19:17.030 --> 19:19.440
<b>Sugar Bunny is in trouble!</b>

19:19.530 --> 19:21.780
<b>Can we cheer for Sugar Bunny together?</b>

19:23.490 --> 19:26.160
<b>Well, this is unexpected.</b>

19:26.240 --> 19:28.120
<b>Wha-- who are you?</b>

19:28.200 --> 19:29.660
<b>We're in the middle of a show!</b>

19:30.290 --> 19:31.670
<b>Shut it.</b>

19:31.750 --> 19:32.750
<b>I'll kill you.</b>

19:32.830 --> 19:33.670
<b>Huh?</b>

19:34.670 --> 19:36.170
<b>Uh, Sugar Bunny?</b>

19:38.920 --> 19:41.050
<b>Now that I have a good view…</b>

19:44.300 --> 19:45.600
<b>it's time for round two.</b>

19:46.220 --> 19:48.060
<b>I'll smash you to the ground.</b>

19:48.140 --> 19:49.770
<b>What "view"?</b>

19:49.850 --> 19:51.690
<b>You still can't see.</b>

19:51.770 --> 19:54.060
<b>Do you want these kids
to witness a bloody--</b>

19:56.020 --> 19:57.230
<b>Oh yeah!</b>

19:57.320 --> 20:00.940
<b>There's Sugar Bunny's Rabbit Punch!</b>

20:01.030 --> 20:03.110
<b>What? But how?</b>

20:03.200 --> 20:06.120
<b>Everybody! Let's cheer for Sugar Bunny!</b>

20:08.870 --> 20:13.790
<b>Sugar Bunny! Sugar Bunny!</b>

20:29.850 --> 20:31.930
<b>Rabbit Right Uppercut!</b>

20:32.020 --> 20:33.940
<b><i>What are these moves?</i></b>

20:34.020 --> 20:35.480
<b><i>Can he see me?</i></b>

20:37.110 --> 20:39.570
<b>Wow, this is impressive.</b>

20:39.650 --> 20:42.150
<b>It's pretty realistic, isn't it, honey?</b>

20:44.320 --> 20:47.070
<b>Look, Hana, daddy's glued to the show.</b>

20:47.160 --> 20:48.950
<b>He's like a little kid!</b>

20:49.660 --> 20:51.450
<b><i>Right. Right.</i></b>

20:51.540 --> 20:53.210
<b><i>Left. Left.</i></b>

20:53.290 --> 20:55.540
<b><i>Right. Right counterpunch.</i></b>

20:55.620 --> 20:57.880
<b><i>Jab. Another jab.</i></b>

20:57.960 --> 21:01.380
<b><i>His guard's open, aim for the body.</i></b>

21:01.460 --> 21:03.130
<b><i>Left counterpunch.</i></b>

21:03.220 --> 21:04.550
<b><i>Step in, body blow.</i></b>

21:10.060 --> 21:11.890
<b><i>What the hell is happening?</i></b>

21:11.970 --> 21:14.060
<b><i>There's no way the poison's broken down.</i></b>

21:15.310 --> 21:18.610
<b><i>It's not just that he's seeing me,</i></b>

21:19.190 --> 21:22.190
<b><i>he's reading my every move!</i></b>

21:22.280 --> 21:23.650
<b>What is this?</b>

21:23.740 --> 21:25.990
<b>You changing up your vibe now?</b>

21:26.070 --> 21:28.490
<b>You're just the sidekick!</b>

21:32.620 --> 21:34.750
<b><i>Are his eyes… closed?</i></b>

21:35.500 --> 21:36.500
<b><i>Finish it.</i></b>

21:50.010 --> 21:53.930
<b>Super attack, the Dynamite Rabbit Shock!</b>

21:54.020 --> 21:55.930
<b>-Sugar Bunny!
-Sugar Bunny!</b>

21:56.020 --> 21:58.440
<b>Sugar Bunny! Sugar Bunny!</b>

22:02.190 --> 22:03.440
<b><i>Nice work.</i></b>

22:03.980 --> 22:05.690
<b><i>My pleasure.</i></b>
