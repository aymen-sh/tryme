<b>Is this the second time

04:31.810 --> 04:34.620
<b>Blue Lock General Director</b>

04:32.720 --> 04:34.620
<b>Good to see you again.</b>

04:34.970 --> 04:37.330
<b>Wow, it's been ages.</b>

04:37.330 --> 04:38.840
<b>Ego in the flesh.</b>

04:39.280 --> 04:41.330
<b>Let me redefine this.</b>

04:41.770 --> 04:44.340
<b>Soccer is a sport where you score goals.</b>

04:44.830 --> 04:47.450
<b>Goals are the one 
and only existential value.</b>

04:47.810 --> 04:54.310
<b>That's why I've built a team around 
the egoist with the highest goal average.</b>

04:55.430 --> 04:57.090
<b>Prepare yourselves and listen up.</b>

04:57.090 --> 05:02.940
<b>I will now announce the eleven players 
who will take on Japan's U-20s.</b>

05:05.190 --> 05:07.320
<b>First, the guy up top:</b>

05:08.250 --> 05:09.680
<b>Itoshi Rin.</b>

05:11.990 --> 05:15.830
<b>He has the highest goal 
average of 2.5 per game.</b>

05:15.830 --> 05:21.680
<b>The team will employ a super all-out 
attack formation centered around you.</b>

05:22.170 --> 05:25.050
<b>If they score five, 
you will score six and win.</b>

05:25.530 --> 05:27.320
<b>"Destruction follows destruction."</b>

05:27.320 --> 05:32.250
<b>As its vanguard, you embody
 the philosophy of this team.</b>

05:33.070 --> 05:38.550
<b>And the remaining ten players will be 
the bullets that escalate that destruction.</b>

05:38.940 --> 05:40.900
<b>First up, the goalkeeper:</b>

05:41.490 --> 05:42.820
<b>Gagamaru Gin.</b>

05:43.180 --> 05:45.210
<b>Oh. Me?</b>

05:46.610 --> 05:49.320
<b>Explosive reactions 
and a body on springs.</b>

05:49.770 --> 05:53.620
<b>You scored highest in 
the goalkeeper aptitude.</b>

05:54.050 --> 05:56.840
<b>You'll be the guardian of this team.</b>

05:56.870 --> 06:00.210
<b>So that's why. Got it.</b>

06:00.780 --> 06:03.510
<b>Next up are the two center backs:</b>

06:03.760 --> 06:05.390
<b>Aryu Jyubei...</b>

06:05.390 --> 06:06.770
<b>and Niko Ikki.</b>

06:07.260 --> 06:10.840
<b>The right center back will overwhelm
opponents with his height and reach.</b>

06:11.530 --> 06:15.430
<b>The left center back has a sharp mind 
for stealing the ball and reading the field.</b>

06:16.250 --> 06:22.230
<b>And the two full-backs who'll use speed and 
technique to dribble up and down the flanks...</b>

06:22.230 --> 06:25.470
<b>On the right is Chigiri Hyoma.</b>

06:25.470 --> 06:26.440
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

06:26.440 --> 06:29.830
<b>And on the left is Bachira Meguru.</b>

06:29.830 --> 06:31.280
<b>All righty.</b>

06:31.710 --> 06:35.500
<b>That said, no matter where I am 
on the field, I'll try to score.</b>

06:38.010 --> 06:45.130
<b>And the defensive midfielder connecting 
this defensive line to the front line...</b>

06:46.080 --> 06:47.530
<b>Karasu Tabito.</b>

06:48.170 --> 06:51.100
<b>You're the best at keeping
 the ball in Blue Lock,</b>

06:51.100 --> 06:56.150
<b>and your analytical skills help you see 
chances, so you'll be the heart of this team.</b>

06:57.560 --> 06:59.810
<b>I had a feeling you'd say that, dumdum.</b>

07:00.900 --> 07:03.450
<b>Now for the attackers.</b>

07:04.490 --> 07:07.900
<b>Slicing through the opponent's defensive
 walls from the wings, we have...</b>

07:08.500 --> 07:09.730
<b>Otoya Eita.</b>

07:09.730 --> 07:11.110
<b>'Kay.</b>

07:11.690 --> 07:13.130
<b>Yukimiya Kenyu.</b>

07:13.130 --> 07:15.080
<b>Yes, my pleasure.</b>

07:15.560 --> 07:18.830
<b>The right winger has speed and stealth
 to get behind opponents,</b>

07:19.380 --> 07:23.340
<b>while the left winger 
dominates in one-on-ones.</b>

07:23.850 --> 07:30.840
<b>And the two players stationed 
between them as the core of our attack:</b>

07:31.450 --> 07:36.940
<b>First, a superb talent who scores 
stellar goals thanks to his ball control...</b>

07:37.850 --> 07:39.180
<b>Nagi Seishiro.</b>

07:40.170 --> 07:41.170
<b>Gotcha.</b>

07:43.050 --> 07:44.850
<b>And let me remind you again.</b>

07:45.220 --> 07:50.860
<b>This team employs a super all-out attack 
formation, centered around Itoshi Rin.</b>

07:48.200 --> 07:50.860
<b>Super All-Out</b>

07:48.200 --> 07:50.860
<b>Attack</b>

07:48.530 --> 07:50.860
<b>Formation</b>

07:50.860 --> 07:55.940
<b>The one who scored highest 
in compatibility with Itoshi Rin,</b>

07:55.940 --> 08:00.000
<b>fulfilling the "assertion and coexistence" 
requirement as his shadow,</b>

08:00.000 --> 08:03.610
<b>while possessing the talent to 
subjugate him and score himself...</b>

08:05.690 --> 08:08.020
<b>The last piece of this puzzle is you...</b>

08:10.090 --> 08:11.670
<b>Isagi Yoichi.</b>

08:15.740 --> 08:16.570
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
<b>That is all.</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Yukimiya</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Nagi</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Itoshi</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Isagi</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Otoya</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Bachira</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Niko</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Karasu</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Aryu</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Chigiri</b>

08:22.150 --> 08:24.980
<b>Gagamaru</b>

08:22.390 --> 08:28.150
<b>Here's the Blue Lock XI to face Japan's U-20s.</b>

08:30.710 --> 08:33.070
<b><i>I did it. I got chosen.</i></b>

08:34.060 --> 08:36.350
<b><i>I'm one of the Blue Lock XI!</i></b>

08:44.790 --> 08:47.120
<b>Damn it.</b>

08:47.930 --> 08:49.020
<b>I have a question.</b>

08:49.560 --> 08:52.410
<b>Why isn't Shidou-kun on the team?</b>

08:52.720 --> 08:55.940
<b>He scored goals, and he's the No.2, right?</b>

08:56.490 --> 09:02.640
<b>Indeed, Shidou Ryusei did have 
a high goal average of 2.0 per game.</b>

09:03.250 --> 09:06.050
<b>But those goals all stemmed
 from his own skills.</b>

09:06.050 --> 09:08.230
<b>Which means that in these tryouts,</b>

09:08.910 --> 09:12.280
<b>he wasn't able to trigger a single 
chemical reaction with Itoshi Rin.</b>

09:09.330 --> 09:12.280
<b>Chemical 
Reaction</b>

09:09.330 --> 09:12.280
<b>Chemical 
Reaction</b>

09:09.900 --> 09:12.280
<b>m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100</b>

09:09.900 --> 09:12.280
<b>m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100</b>

09:09.900 --> 09:12.280
<b>m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100</b>

09:09.900 --> 09:12.280
<b>m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100</b>

09:12.690 --> 09:18.410
<b>Plus, if he gets a red card for violent conduct, 
it'll put us at a major disadvantage.</b>

09:18.410 --> 09:24.370
<b>For these reasons, I've determined 
he shouldn't be on the same field as Itoshi Rin.</b>

09:24.370 --> 09:29.960
<b>More importantly, none of you can handle 
an egoist of Shidou Ryusei's caliber.</b>

09:30.540 --> 09:35.090
<b>Someone who gets his thought process and 
goals to mutually improve the level of play...</b>

09:35.090 --> 09:38.970
<b>We have no such talent here in Blue Lock.</b>

09:38.970 --> 09:43.810
<b>I mean, I don't think there's anyone anywhere
 in Japan who can handle a guy like him.</b>

09:43.810 --> 09:48.150
<b>But it'd be such a waste 
not to make use of his talents.</b>

09:48.730 --> 09:53.610
<b>Right. So Shidou Ryusei will be a joker card
 we can sub in for Itoshi Rin.</b>

09:54.360 --> 09:55.890
<b>Or at least, that <i>was</i> the plan.</b>

09:57.420 --> 09:58.990
<b>What changed?</b>

09:59.660 --> 10:04.450
<b>A few hours ago, I received 
a phone call from Buratsuta of the JFU.</b>

10:04.460 --> 10:10.010
<b>Japan Football Union</b>

10:04.460 --> 10:10.010
<b>Buratsuta</b>

10:04.890 --> 10:10.010
<b>Unless we meet a condition proposed 
by Itoshi Sae, he'll back out of the match.</b>

10:12.250 --> 10:17.170
<b>If Itoshi Sae doesn't play, the match will 
be canceled, since the tickets won't sell.</b>

10:17.170 --> 10:21.530
<b>And Blue Lock will die a natural death.
 That's what he said.</b>

10:22.290 --> 10:25.490
<b>The condition Itoshi Sae proposed is this...</b>

10:29.210 --> 10:31.810
<b>3 hours earlier</b>

10:33.450 --> 10:35.900
<b>Lemme outta here, you four-eyed bastard.</b>

10:36.470 --> 10:39.400
<b>I promise I won't hit anyone anymore.</b>

10:42.820 --> 10:44.560
<b>I know you can hear me!</b>

10:44.560 --> 10:47.080
<b>I'll kill you, Mr. Lock-Off Specs!</b>

10:54.610 --> 10:57.250
<b>What's up, Devil Boy?</b>

10:58.090 --> 10:59.490
<b>Who the hell are you?</b>

11:00.720 --> 11:04.430
<b>This cage must be too small for you.</b>

11:07.830 --> 11:09.430
<b>I'll set you free.</b>

11:10.170 --> 11:12.180
<b>I want your ego.</b>

11:12.810 --> 11:15.770
<b>Go berserk for me.</b>

11:22.870 --> 11:29.910
<b>The condition was to add a player of 
his choice from Blue Lock to the U-20s.</b>

11:29.910 --> 11:36.070
<b>In other words, Itoshi Sae 
chose Shidou Ryusei over you.</b>

11:38.300 --> 11:40.760
<b>We have 15 days left.</b>

11:42.010 --> 11:46.430
<b>I'll assign you a training schedule
that'll guarantee us victory.</b>

11:46.730 --> 11:49.060
<b>Give it everything you've got.</b>

11:49.570 --> 11:52.860
<b>From here on, failure will not be tolerated.</b>

11:53.340 --> 11:56.350
<b>Hmph. That's half-baked, you four-eyed rat.</b>

11:57.160 --> 12:02.010
<b>For me, this game is nothing but a stepping 
stone to becoming number one in the world.</b>

12:02.700 --> 12:07.910
<b>True. I mean, I already bet
 my life when I got here.</b>

12:08.280 --> 12:10.750
<b>I ain't average enough for that to scare me.</b>

12:10.750 --> 12:12.550
<b>I'm getting stoked.</b>

12:12.550 --> 12:13.960
<b>I'm looking forward to it.</b>

12:14.420 --> 12:16.750
<b>Yeah. I want to play them now.</b>

12:17.520 --> 12:21.670
<b>That's the ego I want to see, Blue Lock XI.</b>

12:22.190 --> 12:25.890
<b><i>Right. My goal isn't just 
to get picked for the team.</i></b>

12:26.890 --> 12:32.440
<b><i>I will... no, Blue Lock will win 
this game and go beyond it...</i></b>

12:33.650 --> 12:34.820
<b><i>Onto the world stage!</i></b>

12:43.590 --> 12:45.570
<b>The match is in two weeks.</b>

12:45.740 --> 12:50.290
<b>Japan's U-20s Manager</b>

12:46.090 --> 12:50.290
<b>And joining the Japan team 
for the first time is...</b>

12:50.870 --> 12:52.870
<b>Itoshi Sae!</b>

12:52.870 --> 12:55.830
<b>New Generation
World's Best 11</b>

12:55.830 --> 12:58.340
<b>Wow, it's really him.</b>

12:58.340 --> 13:00.330
<b>I can't believe we get to play with him.</b>

13:00.330 --> 13:04.240
<b>Is that a good thing? 
He looks like an unpleasant prince to me.</b>

13:01.440 --> 13:07.860
<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

13:04.240 --> 13:05.840
<b>Hey, he can hear you.</b>

13:05.840 --> 13:06.760
<b>Who's that guy?</b>

13:06.760 --> 13:11.310
<b>Hm? Must be a freebie that came
with Itoshi Sae. Who knows?</b>

13:11.660 --> 13:17.160
<b>For the honor of representing Japan, 
we can't afford to lose, no matter what.</b>

13:17.160 --> 13:19.020
<b>Sae-kun, tell them how eager you are.</b>

13:19.890 --> 13:22.980
<b>I don't have an ounce 
of interest in any of you.</b>

13:23.840 --> 13:29.160
<b>But a chance like this doesn't come 
around twice in your playing careers.</b>

13:29.160 --> 13:32.270
<b>Do your best not to irritate me. That is all.</b>

13:32.270 --> 13:33.450
<b>Wait, um...</b>

13:34.860 --> 13:36.330
<b>Talk about confidence.</b>

13:36.830 --> 13:39.140
<b>Don't underestimate us, Mr. Genius.</b>

13:39.140 --> 13:44.550
<b>People might make a fuss about you overseas, 
but that's just at academy level.</b>

13:44.550 --> 13:49.220
<b>We play in Japan's top league, 
and I'm a starting forward.</b>

13:49.220 --> 13:50.650
<b>So watch your mouth.</b>

13:50.990 --> 13:55.520
<b>And? You compete to be the top scorer 
in Japan, play for the Japan team,</b>

13:55.840 --> 14:01.980
<b>make an annual salary of 50 million yen, 
marry a pin-up model, and have a happy family.</b>

14:01.980 --> 14:05.280
<b>That's about the limits
of your soccer career.</b>

14:06.090 --> 14:08.610
<b>My only interest is becoming
 the best in the world.</b>

14:09.450 --> 14:12.010
<b>The depth of your desire 
is nowhere near mine.</b>

14:12.490 --> 14:13.960
<b>I-I wanna be the best—</b>

14:13.950 --> 14:16.160
<b><i>You</i> should watch your mouth!</b>

14:16.600 --> 14:18.570
<b>You waste of a striker!</b>

14:18.960 --> 14:22.170
<b>Too bad. So sad. See you in your next life.</b>

14:22.170 --> 14:25.620
<b>You've got zero sense if 
you're concerned about status.</b>

14:25.620 --> 14:27.540
<b>Wh-What's your deal?!</b>

14:27.540 --> 14:28.760
<b>That's our star player—</b>

14:28.760 --> 14:29.490
<b>Oh?</b>

14:29.450 --> 14:32.430
<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

14:30.160 --> 14:32.430
<b>You all wanna go?</b>

14:32.800 --> 14:35.600
<b>Okay, if I win, put me in the starting lineup.</b>

14:35.600 --> 14:36.930
<b>S-Stop already!</b>

14:37.790 --> 14:39.270
<b>Shut up, freebie.</b>

14:39.580 --> 14:41.250
<b>Don't you dare insult me!</b>

14:41.250 --> 14:44.090
<b>Okay, here's my first goal!</b>

14:46.400 --> 14:48.640
<b>All right, you guys. Stop it now.</b>

14:49.100 --> 14:51.910
<b>Talk about being underestimated.</b>

14:55.820 --> 14:58.880
<b>Love the spirit, little puppy.</b>

14:59.320 --> 15:02.790
<b>But it's on the field you're 
supposed to be showing results.</b>

15:03.290 --> 15:07.050
<b>Li'l Genius, you're a newcomer here, too.</b>

15:07.050 --> 15:10.380
<b>So why don't you win 
our trust with your play?</b>

15:11.290 --> 15:12.840
<b>As the defensive line...</b>

15:12.850 --> 15:14.600
<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

15:13.350 --> 15:14.600
<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

15:15.120 --> 15:18.600
<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

15:15.970 --> 15:17.510
<b>...we've got your back.</b>

15:20.090 --> 15:23.620
<b>Built around their tall defender, Aiku, 
who's gotten offers from Italy's Serie A,</b>

15:22.560 --> 15:27.030
<b>The captain of the team</b>

15:22.560 --> 15:27.030
<b>for his strong defensive skills.</b>

15:22.560 --> 15:27.030
<b>Aiku plays at center back, and the Japan team...</b>

15:22.560 --> 15:27.030
<b>He has roots in Sweden, Germany, and Japan. As a defender...</b>

15:22.560 --> 15:27.030
<b>His physique and leadership skills are second to none among his peers...</b>

15:22.560 --> 15:27.030
<b>He's one of the notable players who will be the next generation's....</b>

15:22.560 --> 15:27.030
<b>Having received offers from Serie A clubs in Italy, his presence is known</b>

15:22.560 --> 15:27.030
<b>throughout the world of soccer.  When he was younger, he played keeper</b>

15:22.560 --> 15:27.030
<b>converted to a defender and his talent blossomed.</b>

15:23.620 --> 15:27.030
<b>the U-20s play a catenaccio system.</b>

15:29.580 --> 15:32.990
<b>I see. So they're a defensive team.</b>

15:33.370 --> 15:34.870
<b>We just need to smash 'em, right?</b>

15:34.870 --> 15:40.180
<b>Yeah. That said, they <i>are</i> the strongest 
elite team of players under 20 in Japan,</b>

15:40.180 --> 15:42.460
<b>so it won't be that easy.</b>

15:42.460 --> 15:44.830
<b>So we just need to smash 'em, right?</b>

15:44.830 --> 15:48.130
<b>Bachira, you keep repeating yourself.</b>

15:50.410 --> 15:53.770
<b>Because we just need to smash 'em, right?</b>

15:55.680 --> 15:57.610
<b>Are you even listening?</b>

15:59.090 --> 16:03.140
<b><i>Complete your morning drill
 and take a break.</i></b>

16:03.600 --> 16:06.620
<b><i>"Smash 'em," huh?</i></b>

16:06.620 --> 16:10.450
<b><i>In that case, I think 
I'm still lacking in power.</i></b>

16:11.660 --> 16:15.580
<b><i>Entering that trancelike
 state was a total fluke.</i></b>

16:16.280 --> 16:18.790
<b><i>If I could use that on command...</i></b>

16:23.720 --> 16:24.750
<b>Rin?</b>

16:25.210 --> 16:26.920
<b>Hey, it's break time.</b>

16:26.920 --> 16:28.350
<b>You should rest a little.</b>

16:28.750 --> 16:32.260
<b>Huh? If you're going to 
interfere, get out, Isagi.</b>

16:32.260 --> 16:35.510
<b>Yeah, but if you overdo it and get injured—</b>

16:35.510 --> 16:40.020
<b>If I do, that means I'm only at that level.</b>

16:41.080 --> 16:45.090
<b>At last, I get to play against 
my big bro. Against Itoshi Sae.</b>

16:45.090 --> 16:47.920
<b>I get to crush and surpass him.</b>

16:49.090 --> 16:52.830
<b>You have no idea how much 
I've longed for this moment.</b>

17:02.540 --> 17:03.830
<b>I don't need it.</b>

17:04.190 --> 17:07.670
<b>You get injured, Blue Lock's over.</b>

17:08.220 --> 17:10.630
<b>I'm telling you not to 
cause problems for me.</b>

17:11.170 --> 17:12.010
<b>Drink.</b>

17:13.610 --> 17:14.270
<b>Hmph.</b>

17:18.370 --> 17:19.470
<b>It's lukewarm.</b>

17:19.890 --> 17:20.840
<b>Can it.</b>

17:24.750 --> 17:27.530
<b><i>I've never seen that look
 on Rin's face before.</i></b>

17:28.850 --> 17:31.620
<b><i>I want to win this match... with him.</i></b>

17:37.190 --> 17:39.870
<b>Hello there, Team Blue Lock.</b>

17:40.300 --> 17:43.340
<b>Your training should have 
your bodies awake by now.</b>

17:44.060 --> 17:47.460
<b>So now, we need to wake up your brains.</b>

17:47.770 --> 17:50.670
<b>I'll teach you how to 
ignite a fire in your life,</b>

17:50.990 --> 17:53.870
<b>which is essential for becoming
 the best striker in the world.</b>

17:55.510 --> 18:00.550
<b>"Flow." It's a mentally absorbed state
 that can be obtained</b>

18:00.550 --> 18:03.100
<b>through personal optimal experiences.</b>

18:03.450 --> 18:07.970
<b>Regardless of their scale, human beings 
have moments when they're so focused,</b>

18:07.970 --> 18:10.940
<b>they even forget the passage of time.</b>

18:11.190 --> 18:15.150
<b>That state of enjoying whatever it is
and getting the brain all excited...</b>

18:15.790 --> 18:17.690
<b>That's "flow."</b>

18:18.490 --> 18:19.490
<b>Think back.</b>

18:20.210 --> 18:25.450
<b>To when you broke out of
your shells here at Blue Lock.</b>

18:25.860 --> 18:29.460
<b>To when you poured 
all you had into that one play.</b>

18:30.330 --> 18:31.400
<b><i>Flow.</i></b>

18:31.740 --> 18:33.680
<b><i>It does ring a bell.</i></b>

18:35.270 --> 18:38.630
<b><i>If this "flow" is the key to 
reproducing that trancelike state...</i></b>

18:38.920 --> 18:42.600
<b>So how do you get into this flow?</b>

18:42.870 --> 18:47.810
<b>The most important condition is 
concentrating on a daring challenge.</b>

18:49.200 --> 18:55.350
<b>To put it plainly, you have to aim 
for an objective of optimal difficulty.</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>Mentally Absorbed State</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>Balance
Between</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>Challenge 
and Ability</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>State</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>Difficulty of Challenge</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>Your Ability</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>Anxiety</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>Boredom</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>High</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>High</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>Low</b>

18:55.880 --> 19:02.450
<b>Low</b>

18:56.810 --> 19:02.450
<b>This image shows the balance between 
challenge and ability to get into a flow state.</b>

19:02.840 --> 19:11.020
<b>If your abilities exceed a given challenge, 
you won't feel joy and you'll get bored.</b>

19:03.040 --> 19:20.220
<b>High</b>

19:03.040 --> 19:20.220
<b>High</b>

19:03.040 --> 19:20.220
<b>Low</b>

19:03.040 --> 19:20.220
<b>Low</b>

19:03.040 --> 19:20.220
<b>Difficulty of Challenge</b>

19:03.040 --> 19:20.220
<b>Your Ability</b>

19:03.330 --> 19:20.220
<b>Balance Between 
Challenge and Ability</b>

19:09.480 --> 19:11.730
<b>Bored</b>

19:11.020 --> 19:16.240
<b>Conversely, if a given challenge 
exceeds your abilities,</b>

19:16.580 --> 19:20.220
<b>you can't see yourself succeeding
 and you become anxious.</b>

19:18.610 --> 19:20.220
<b>Anxious</b>

19:20.860 --> 19:26.810
<b>In short, you can't experience joy 
in a state of boredom or anxiety.</b>

19:27.130 --> 19:30.150
<b>That's why you need concentration 
for a daring challenge.</b>

19:31.080 --> 19:33.420
<b>Know Your Abilities</b>

19:31.420 --> 19:33.650
<b>Know your abilities precisely...</b>

19:33.610 --> 19:35.400
<b>Control Your Abilities</b>

19:33.650 --> 19:35.070
<b>and control them.</b>

19:35.450 --> 19:38.400
<b>Then, challenge yourself with a goal 
that's appropriate to you.</b>

19:35.530 --> 19:38.400
<b>Challenge Yourself With a Clear Goal</b>

19:38.400 --> 19:43.250
<b>In that moment, you will pull out
an exceptional performance,</b>

19:43.250 --> 19:46.640
<b>which will push you up to the next level.</b>

19:47.310 --> 19:50.040
<b>From the outside, 
it might look like a miracle.</b>

19:50.040 --> 19:52.250
<b>But there's a formula to it.</b>

19:52.920 --> 19:54.880
<b>And that's "flow."</b>

19:57.510 --> 19:58.720
<b>However...</b>

19:59.890 --> 20:02.240
<b>It's not easy to achieve.</b>

20:03.630 --> 20:07.000
<b>Your daily life is flooded with 
information and entertainment.</b>

20:07.000 --> 20:10.680
<b>It's an endless hell to cover up
 your boredom and anxiety.</b>

20:10.940 --> 20:14.690
<b>People can't get absorbed 
in something so easily.</b>

20:15.030 --> 20:19.300
<b>For example, you may passively get 
into a trancelike state on your phone.</b>

20:19.300 --> 20:23.060
<b>But that's not the flow state you 
actively achieve, available only to you.</b>

20:23.500 --> 20:27.490
<b>That cannot be classed as "ego" in my book.</b>

20:27.840 --> 20:30.250
<b>The thrill you feel when you score a goal.</b>

20:30.750 --> 20:34.420
<b>The exhilaration you feel 
when you gain a new weapon.</b>

20:34.830 --> 20:38.090
<b>That joy is something 
that belongs only to you.</b>

20:39.670 --> 20:41.550
<b>That's ego.</b>

20:42.670 --> 20:47.370
<b>Blue Lock's the place where you escape 
the diarrhea of that passive trancelike state,</b>

20:47.370 --> 20:51.180
<b>and only those who fully immerse 
themselves in soccer can survive.</b>

20:51.180 --> 20:54.980
<b>So remember, diamonds in the rough...</b>

20:55.300 --> 20:59.000
<b>the meaning of everything 
you've experienced in Blue Lock.</b>

20:59.000 --> 21:02.070
<b>Remember how you've all evolved.</b>

21:02.670 --> 21:03.930
<b><i>I see.</i></b>

21:04.450 --> 21:11.790
<b><i>It's true that I became absorbed in 
my potential each time I grew stronger.</i></b>

21:13.360 --> 21:19.500
<b>Now, does the goal of defeating 
Japan's U-20s make you feel...</b>

21:20.160 --> 21:21.710
<b>bored?</b>

21:22.330 --> 21:23.740
<b>Anxious?</b>

21:24.170 --> 21:25.430
<b>No.</b>

21:26.460 --> 21:29.640
<b><i>It's a challenge I can immerse myself in.</i></b>

21:29.960 --> 21:31.400
<b>You get it now, don't you?</b>

21:31.730 --> 21:36.810
<b>The door to defeating Japan's U-20s
 will only be opened</b>

21:36.810 --> 21:42.650
<b>when you, the Blue Lock XI, get into 
a flow state on the field on game day.</b>

21:43.310 --> 21:47.910
<b><i>On that grand stage, 
I will find my unique flow.</i></b>

21:48.660 --> 21:50.950
<b>Now, let's prepare.</b>

21:50.950 --> 21:57.170
<b>You're the new generation of egoists who 
will tear down Japanese soccer's status quo.</b>

21:57.170 --> 21:59.270
<b>The world's waiting for your goals.</b>

22:01.630 --> 22:02.960

<b><i>The goal I can immerse myself in.</i></b>

<b><i>Oh, I see. We've got two airheads.</i></b>

24:14.160 --> 24:20.140
<b><i>With this type, the best way to build a 
rapport is to rely on sensibilities, not logic.</i></b>

24:20.670 --> 24:23.930
<b><i>To do that, I should gather
info on their preferences.</i></b>

<b>What do you two do on your days off?</b>

24:27.620 --> 24:30.150
<b>I'd like to get to know you both.</b>

24:30.800 --> 24:32.580
<b>I'm in the mountains.</b>

24:32.580 --> 24:35.500
<b>So I pick wild vegetables, sunbathe,</b>

24:35.500 --> 24:37.760

24:37.760 --> 24:42.880

<b>GLAM</b>

24:48.440 --> 24:52.050
<b>Feeling the universe, cherishing beauty,
 offering prayers to Buddha...</b>

24:52.050 --> 24:54.810
<b>When you empty your mind, 
even fire feels glam!</b>

25:01.620 --> 25:05.850
<b>W-Wow, very nice. 
I like how unique you both are.</b>

25:06.130 --> 25:08.980
<b><i>Without dismissing them, 
be positive and compliment them.</i></b>

25:08.980 --> 25:12.280
<b><i>That's the best course of 
action to gain their trust.</i></b>

25:12.280 --> 25:15.450
