00:05.930 --> 00:09.430
<i>An E-Rank hunter taking a carrier job 
in an A-Rank dungeon?</i>

00:09.990 --> 00:12.450
<i>Does he think he's invincible?</i>

00:13.330 --> 00:14.790
<i>Why would he do that?</i>

00:15.950 --> 00:17.480
<i>Thinking back to yesterday...</i>

00:17.480 --> 00:20.680
<i>I thought I saw him in front 
of the boss room with a weapon.</i>

00:21.290 --> 00:22.480
<i>That's suspicious.</i>

00:23.500 --> 00:25.290
I'll be going in for a bit, too.

00:26.180 --> 00:28.270
Did something happen in the dungeon?

00:28.270 --> 00:30.800
No, it's personal business.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.520
Nothing to worry about.

00:36.700 --> 00:40.240
Sorry, but do you have a weapon I can borrow?

00:44.220 --> 00:45.400
Um...

00:45.400 --> 00:49.700
Would there happen to be anything else? 
Like a sword or a spear.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.860
Not around here, no.

00:51.860 --> 00:54.230
If you'd prefer a shovel or a crowbar, maybe?

00:54.230 --> 00:56.830
Never mind, then. I'll just get going.

00:59.020 --> 01:02.670
Hunter Cha, are you really 
going in empty-handed?

01:05.770 --> 01:09.740
I know it's not much, 
but it's better than nothing!

01:09.740 --> 01:10.910
Good point.

03:06.850 --> 03:08.260
There's so many.

03:08.260 --> 03:10.780
If this many high orcs were to 
break out of the dungeon...

03:11.180 --> 03:14.880
They could flatten a city or two.

03:15.230 --> 03:16.840
Those four in particular.

03:17.190 --> 03:20.510
They've got a lot more aura 
than the other high orcs!

03:26.720 --> 03:29.500
<i>It's our job to make sure the gate closes.</i>

03:29.500 --> 03:32.820
<i>If nothing else, we have to make sure 
the dungeon boss goes down!</i>

03:34.560 --> 03:36.720
Do you fear me,

03:38.300 --> 03:40.550
pitiful humans?

03:43.230 --> 03:44.880
<i>This is unbelievable!</i>

03:44.880 --> 03:47.500
<i>How does he have so much magic power?</i>

03:47.860 --> 03:52.590
<i>Compared to him, it's like I'm a 
third-rate spellcaster at best!</i>

03:53.830 --> 03:57.420
Wh-Why did you call us here?

03:57.420 --> 03:59.010
For entertainment.

04:00.650 --> 04:05.030
You will be killed, tortured, 
and devoured one by one.

04:05.030 --> 04:08.170
For the enjoyment of my soldiers.

04:10.030 --> 04:11.110
Entertainment?

04:11.600 --> 04:17.470
<i>That's all he thinks we're good for? 
All our lives amount to?</i>

04:18.070 --> 04:21.780
<i>We're nothing more than toys for 
them to break and then discard?</i>

04:22.000 --> 04:26.950
<i>Oh? There seems to be something 
strange mixed in with the humans.</i>

04:26.950 --> 04:30.120
<i>It should make for an interesting diversion.</i>

04:31.060 --> 04:32.920
Everyone, charge!

04:45.040 --> 04:46.680
Song of Guardian.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.190
Imbecile.

04:53.190 --> 04:55.070
Antigravity.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.820
Gravity Acceleration.

05:01.740 --> 05:02.700
Captain!

05:08.640 --> 05:10.160
Kihoon...

05:19.750 --> 05:23.640
Captain Son. The Hunters Guild 
has the rights to this dungeon.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.640
I really shouldn't get involved.

05:26.410 --> 05:30.350
But the strike team is in real danger.

05:32.490 --> 05:34.400
So I'm going to ask you...

05:39.160 --> 05:42.910
Is it okay if I take all of these magic beasts?

05:47.450 --> 05:50.580
Please... do it.

05:52.100 --> 05:56.950
Not unlike a monkey's mimicry... 
and no more intimidating.

06:02.060 --> 06:06.300
I'll admit, I've never seen anyone with 
an aura as intense as yours before.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.010
Naturally.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.730
Unfortunately, this is a terrible matchup.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.510
And when I say that...

06:18.480 --> 06:21.520
I mean for you.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.080
The Surveillance Team?

06:29.080 --> 06:31.030
What are they doing here?

06:31.030 --> 06:32.600
How should I know?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.970
Someone call a supervisor!

06:35.460 --> 06:39.130
<i>Why was he working as a miner here? 
And for two days, at that?</i>

06:39.400 --> 06:40.870
Is something wrong?

06:41.460 --> 06:44.010
Is a hunter named Sung Jinwoo working here?

06:44.010 --> 06:45.720
You're looking for Sung?

06:45.720 --> 06:49.540
I knew it! I knew that guy was sketchy!

06:49.540 --> 06:52.880
He gave me the scariest look I've ever seen!

06:52.880 --> 06:55.920
I thought he was gonna kill me!

06:55.920 --> 06:57.650
So, is he here?

06:58.080 --> 06:59.810
He's inside the gate.

06:59.810 --> 07:03.200
They were short on carriers, 
so he was asked to fill in.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.390
To carry their bags?

07:04.390 --> 07:05.240
Yes, sir.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.130
<i>From mining to carrying bags, huh?</i>

07:05.240 --> 07:09.230
He went in as a bag carrier, 
but I know he's up to something in there!

07:08.860 --> 07:12.590
<i>Being an S-Rank makes you a target 
for ongoing surveillance.</i>

07:09.230 --> 07:10.910
Probably murdered somebody!

07:10.910 --> 07:12.940
He looks like he could do it 
without blinking an eye!

07:12.940 --> 07:14.460
<i>I hope he realizes that.</i>

07:12.940 --> 07:14.460
You should've seen the look he gave me!

07:14.460 --> 07:17.180
Hell, I bet he's already got a huge body count!

07:14.800 --> 07:16.320
Um... Is there a problem?

07:16.320 --> 07:18.620
Watch the news tomorrow, 
and you'll understand.

07:18.620 --> 07:19.750
The news?!

07:19.750 --> 07:24.340
It's just, Hunter Cha asked me 
the same question earlier...

07:20.260 --> 07:21.730
This is what I'm talking about!

07:21.730 --> 07:23.590
Throw that asshole in jail already!

07:24.630 --> 07:26.090
Hunter Cha?

07:28.840 --> 07:31.990
What in the world?! 
That's some extraordinary aura!

07:31.990 --> 07:34.170
It felt like it was going to tear me apart.

07:34.170 --> 07:35.900
Measure the magic power again. Fast.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.030
Y-Yes, sir!

07:43.360 --> 07:44.670
<i>I need to hurry.</i>

07:45.140 --> 07:49.990
<i>I have no idea how Kihoon's team 
managed to beat this many high orcs,</i>

07:51.030 --> 07:54.190
<i>but if the magic power I just sensed 
is coming from the dungeon boss...</i>

07:55.510 --> 07:57.660
They could all die.

07:59.050 --> 08:04.480
You must be a fool to confront my army 
with one so meager in number!

08:04.870 --> 08:07.930
Don't look down on my guys.

08:09.410 --> 08:11.640
<i>Monarch's Domain.</i>

08:12.180 --> 08:17.560
<i>A job-exclusive skill that I obtained after 
hitting level 70 in the Demon's Castle.</i>

08:18.030 --> 08:22.480
<i>My shadow soldiers have gotten stronger 
after our excursion to the castle.</i>

08:22.480 --> 08:24.670
What is going on here?

08:24.670 --> 08:26.100
I can believe what I'm seeing.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.950
I can only manage two summons at once, at best.

08:29.420 --> 08:31.910
I've never felt such ominous magic power 
from a human before.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.330
Go!

09:04.820 --> 09:05.990
Did you see that?!

09:05.990 --> 09:08.620
It's like watching the vice guild master...

09:08.620 --> 09:12.030
Why in the world is someone 
this strong working as a carrier?!

09:13.370 --> 09:15.870
<i>My soldiers are around B-Rank.</i>

09:16.920 --> 09:20.760
<i>Each high orc's life comes at the cost 
of four of five of their own.</i>

09:21.130 --> 09:23.050
<i>I had better chip in.</i>

09:23.050 --> 09:24.950
Song of Dragon Fire!

09:28.910 --> 09:32.150
Your soldiers are little more than scarecrows.

09:32.150 --> 09:33.800
Know your place.

09:34.260 --> 09:36.640
I'd say that goes double for you.

09:37.390 --> 09:40.020
Because I can bring mine back 
as many times as it takes.

09:40.020 --> 09:42.190
Song of Guardian.

09:42.490 --> 09:43.860
Acceleration.

09:47.770 --> 09:49.400
Gravity Acceleration.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.400
Antigravity.

09:53.910 --> 09:55.120
Acceleration.

09:58.660 --> 10:03.220
Then I will simply destroy them 
until your magic power is spent.

10:03.220 --> 10:05.150
As many times as it takes!

10:05.750 --> 10:07.710
Song of Fire!

10:17.300 --> 10:20.220
<i>He's using his huge store of magic power 
for ranged, area-of-effect spells</i>

10:20.220 --> 10:22.270
<i>to keep me at a distance.</i>

10:22.750 --> 10:26.980
I'm curious to see how long you will last.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.440
The results are in!

10:30.140 --> 10:33.590
This gate is a higher-end A-Rank, 
almost approaching S!

10:33.590 --> 10:35.410
So the previous measurement was in error.

10:35.980 --> 10:38.430
Contact the Hunters Guild master ASAP.

10:38.430 --> 10:42.020
Once we're ready, we'll head in 
to support the strike team.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.350
R-Right!

10:44.620 --> 10:49.920
It seems my soldiers are superior 
in both quantity and quality.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.480
It's only a matter of time 
before your magic power is depleted.

10:55.590 --> 10:58.550
A matter of time? What are you talking about?

11:03.510 --> 11:06.220
It's time I showed you what 
a necromancer can really do.

11:06.980 --> 11:08.190
Arise.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.690
Turning my soldiers into undead?!

11:13.650 --> 11:16.610
You'll be my shadows, too, soon enough.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.160
And of course...

11:19.390 --> 11:20.560
That includes you.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.520
<i>It can't be.</i>

11:28.480 --> 11:30.120
<i>Would they really...?</i>

11:34.910 --> 11:37.980
<i>But then why...</i>

11:37.980 --> 11:39.680
<i>Why am I here?</i>

11:40.260 --> 11:43.110
<i>When my eyes opened in this place,</i>

11:43.110 --> 11:47.440
<i>the same command ran through 
my head, over and over again.</i>

11:49.050 --> 11:51.280
<i>"Hunt the humans."</i>

11:53.860 --> 11:56.650
<i>The reasons behind it are of no concern.</i>

11:56.650 --> 11:59.610
<i>I need only heed the command.</i>

12:01.900 --> 12:02.950
Go!

12:02.950 --> 12:05.580
Slaughter the interlopers,

12:05.580 --> 12:08.980
and offer the human carcasses as tribute to me!

12:10.890 --> 12:12.960
On par with an S-Rank dungeon?

12:12.960 --> 12:17.210
Hunter Son Kihoon's team 
would've been more than capable,

12:17.210 --> 12:19.100
given the original readings...

12:19.100 --> 12:20.680
We've been caught horribly off guard.

12:21.010 --> 12:23.890
If there's a dungeon break, 
it'll be Jeju Island all over again.

12:23.890 --> 12:26.350
Thankfully, we still have time.

12:26.670 --> 12:30.080
Gather our guild's strongest forces, 
and we'll head there at once.

12:32.340 --> 12:36.400
The emergency call's already gone out 
to all A-Rank hunters and above.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.410
In the worst-case scenario,

12:38.410 --> 12:42.780
we may have to call for assistance 
from the White Tigers and Reapers.

12:42.780 --> 12:44.030
But if we do that...!

12:44.440 --> 12:48.000
Let's do our best to ensure 
it doesn't come to that.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.280
Looks like my personal guards have the edge.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.240
This can't be happening...

13:25.540 --> 13:27.280
Let's get in there!

13:27.280 --> 13:28.160
Yeah!

13:28.440 --> 13:31.150
Song of High Fever! Song of Blindness!

13:32.080 --> 13:35.460
You are the audience. 
Do not presume to take the stage.

13:36.410 --> 13:42.130
And I've had just about enough 
of <i>your</i> insolence.

13:42.130 --> 13:45.390
Song of Sleep! Song of Impediment!

13:45.390 --> 13:47.600
Song of Blindness!

13:47.600 --> 13:48.760
What...?!

13:50.250 --> 13:53.940
Sorry to tell you, but I'm pretty 
resistant to curses and poison.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.020
Song of Guardian!

13:59.830 --> 14:02.490
I'm gonna shatter that annoying shield.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.610
What is this...?

14:25.260 --> 14:29.400
Are those his summons? But there's so many!

14:29.400 --> 14:30.770
Vice Guildmaster?

14:32.430 --> 14:33.860
What are you doing here?

14:33.860 --> 14:35.000
How is he?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.780
The captain's okay.

14:36.780 --> 14:37.900
That's a relief.

14:39.270 --> 14:41.700
But what in the world is going on?

14:41.700 --> 14:44.240
We're not sure ourselves.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.730
How dare you?!

14:46.730 --> 14:50.200
Song of Rage! Song of Strength! Song of Giants!

14:51.540 --> 14:55.460
Be crushed like the insect you are!

14:57.930 --> 14:59.420
Gotta say,

14:59.800 --> 15:02.630
I'm not too fond of giants.

15:02.630 --> 15:04.380
So this really gets on my nerves.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.840
Song of Dragon Fire!

15:24.320 --> 15:29.530
Do you still dare to defy 
the mighty Kargalgan after that?!

15:29.530 --> 15:30.790
Yeah.

15:39.140 --> 15:42.610
The bigger the target, the easier it is to hit.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.980
Did you really think a spellcaster

15:44.980 --> 15:48.430
could fend off an assassin's attack 
without extra protection?

15:50.360 --> 15:53.060
Song of Fire!

16:06.420 --> 16:08.260
<i>If the dagger isn't enough,</i>

16:09.380 --> 16:10.390
<i>then...</i>

16:30.520 --> 16:31.640
Manager Woo?

16:32.460 --> 16:34.640
I see everyone's all right.

16:34.990 --> 16:39.130
We came to aid the strike team after 
sensing an incredible magic power...

16:40.020 --> 16:42.810
but it seems there was no need.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.670
<i>The Surveillance Team's manager, as well?</i>

16:46.570 --> 16:51.680
<i>He seems like a top-class combat hunter, 
but he can use summoning magic, too?</i>

16:52.780 --> 16:56.200
<i>Hunter Sung is this strong?</i>

16:56.710 --> 16:58.680
Who in the world is he?

16:59.040 --> 17:01.310
You know him, don't you?

17:02.160 --> 17:03.960
We're acquainted.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.670
But only in passing.

17:09.180 --> 17:13.850
When spellcasters lose their protection, 
they're finished.

17:13.850 --> 17:15.680
This body....

17:16.010 --> 17:18.890
This body of mine cannot 
possibly be destroyed!

17:19.380 --> 17:23.470
It's impossible!

17:41.350 --> 17:45.630
<i>I know I beat the boss, but taking 
all the drops might be a bit much.</i>

17:45.630 --> 17:49.460
<i>I doubt they'll mind me extracting 
his shadow, though.</i>

17:49.900 --> 17:50.970
Arise.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.220
Looks like becoming a shadow 
mellowed you out a bit.

18:01.770 --> 18:04.940
A name? What was his again...?

18:04.940 --> 18:07.100
Kar... something?

18:07.100 --> 18:09.940
Sorry, I forgot. 
I'll just give you a new one.

18:10.370 --> 18:11.580
Tusk.

18:11.580 --> 18:13.980
Your name is Tusk.

18:15.280 --> 18:18.470
<i>"Elite Knight" rank? Never seen that before.</i>

18:18.940 --> 18:21.790
<i>Makes sense, for an A-Rank dungeon boss.</i>

18:23.170 --> 18:26.380
<i>These high orc soldiers are going to 
make a huge difference, too.</i>

18:28.100 --> 18:29.530
Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

18:30.220 --> 18:31.420
<i>Manager Woo?!</i>

18:31.420 --> 18:34.630
<i>I was so focused on collecting 
the shadows I didn't notice him!</i>

18:34.630 --> 18:35.900
Hunter Sung!

18:35.900 --> 18:38.760
I thought you were a carrier... 
What was all of that?!

18:38.760 --> 18:40.350
Uh, well...

18:40.350 --> 18:41.850
<i>What do I say?</i>

18:43.310 --> 18:45.240
I'm with Hunter Association surveillance.

18:45.690 --> 18:50.570
This is Hunter Sung Jinwoo, 
and his status is top secret.

18:51.310 --> 18:55.410
I need to ask you all to keep what's 
happened here today confidential.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.750
We'll escort you outside.

18:57.750 --> 19:01.210
This is the best way 
to avoid any more attention.

19:02.790 --> 19:09.120
Hunter Sung displayed S-Rank ability 
when saving you all.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.850
I hope you'll cooperate 
with him making a quiet exit.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.010
Wait, please!

19:19.220 --> 19:25.400
Considering your strength, 
I'm sure you have your reasons.

19:25.780 --> 19:28.980
I won't ask why you volunteered 
to carry our equipment.

19:30.170 --> 19:36.280
But it's because of you 
that we all survived, Hunter Sung.

19:37.140 --> 19:40.240
As the captain of this strike team, 
I want to thank you.

19:45.230 --> 19:46.920
Oh, that reminds me.

19:47.510 --> 19:49.250
You can have this back.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.000
Let's get underway.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.900
Excuse me, Vice Guildmaster?

19:58.900 --> 20:00.050
Yes?

20:00.050 --> 20:02.920
Why do you have a pickax?

20:05.230 --> 20:07.980
Do you think he thought I was weird?

20:07.980 --> 20:09.530
Who?

20:09.530 --> 20:12.630
Oh... Uh, no one in particular.

20:15.090 --> 20:18.450
It's a relief that everyone made it out safely.

20:18.940 --> 20:24.910
That said... First the White Tigers, 
and now he's come to our rescue, too.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.920
The ability to summon a number of soldiers, 
speed comparable to an assassin type,

20:29.920 --> 20:32.800
and on top of that, the ability 
to control dead magic beasts...

20:32.800 --> 20:34.920
It's hard to believe.

20:36.280 --> 20:41.170
Hunter Son, who would you say is stronger 
between myself and Hunter Sung Jinwoo?

20:44.870 --> 20:49.830
In raids, hunters of different types 
work together

20:49.830 --> 20:52.480
to compensate for individual weaknesses.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.770
I've always believed that was 
standard operating procedure.

20:56.150 --> 21:03.220
Guildmaster, do you think you could clear 
a higher-end A-Rank dungeon by yourself?

21:04.740 --> 21:06.570
I could not.

21:06.570 --> 21:11.190
Which is embarrassing, considering all the 
talk of me being the "ultimate weapon."

21:12.550 --> 21:13.640
Guildmaster—

21:14.480 --> 21:15.920
I know.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.600
We need him.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.840
I'll do what I can.

21:25.220 --> 21:26.370
Bro!

21:29.520 --> 21:31.270
Sorry about the delay.

21:31.640 --> 21:36.470
So, how'd the guild master business go? 
Did you and your dad sort it out?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.240
Actually...

21:39.750 --> 21:42.360
There's something I'd like to discuss 
with you regarding that.

21:43.450 --> 21:46.410
I'm here at the Hunter's Association.

21:44.540 --> 21:47.280
I'm loving this.

21:46.410 --> 21:50.250
Just the other day, the actor 
Lee Minsung was confirmed as...

21:47.700 --> 21:51.080
They're all here for me, right?

21:51.600 --> 21:54.980
The man who has it all, Lee Minsung.

21:54.980 --> 21:59.050
And now I'm superhuman, to top it off.

21:59.570 --> 22:02.870
Not bad at all.
