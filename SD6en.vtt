16:04.540 --> 16:07.460
<b>You're really no good at anything,
huh, Heisuke?</b>

16:13.220 --> 16:14.890
<b><i>But somehow,</i></b>

16:14.970 --> 16:17.850
<b><i>I could keep pace</i>
<i>when it came to shooting.</i></b>

16:21.020 --> 16:24.100
<b><i>This is it! This has got to be my thing!</i></b>

16:24.980 --> 16:27.360
<b>Hi, I'm the new hire, Heisuke Mashimo.</b>

16:27.440 --> 16:29.650
<b>My expertise is sniping.</b>

16:29.730 --> 16:32.610
<b>In the academy,
I focused on my sniping skills.</b>

<b>I'll be the best sniper you've ever had.</b>

16:35.700 --> 16:36.820
<b>Nice to meet you all!</b>

16:38.490 --> 16:40.240
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

16:42.710 --> 16:46.880
<b>What use would we have

16:46.960 --> 16:47.790
<b>ONE KILL PER DAY</b>

16:47.880 --> 16:50.880
<b>Did you think
you'd get to choose your tasks, rookie?</b>

16:50.960 --> 16:52.170
<b>Go, go!</b>

16:52.260 --> 16:53.220
<b>Kill 'em all!</b>

16:55.630 --> 16:57.680
<b>What're you doing, Mashimo?</b>

16:57.760 --> 16:59.640
<b>You can't even handle a knife?</b>

17:01.930 --> 17:05.480
<b>Mashimo, stop slowing us down!
I'm gonna kill you!</b>

17:09.110 --> 17:10.360
<b>I'm telling you.</b>

17:10.440 --> 17:12.900
<b>You really aren't cut out to be a hit man.</b>

17:12.990 --> 17:15.610
<b>Who cares if you can shoot
if that's all you can do?</b>

17:15.700 --> 17:18.070
<b>Just quit already, jackass.</b>

17:20.830 --> 17:24.580
<b><i>Unable to fit in, I got fired from my job.</i></b>

<b>I need to complete this hit to prove…</b>

18:06.460 --> 18:07.500
<b><i>that I'm not--</i></b>

18:07.580 --> 18:10.710
<b>Shut up already! Your mic is on.</b>

18:11.880 --> 18:13.500
<b>Dang, you heard all that?</b>

18:14.130 --> 18:16.840
<b>Who cares what other people think?</b>

18:16.920 --> 18:18.300
<b>What does it matter?!</b>

18:20.010 --> 18:22.510
