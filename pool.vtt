WEBVTT

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.416
That logo music just

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:38.708
gets you pumped, right?

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm sorry, I'm just excited to be here.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:41.833
It's been a while.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.916
For a long time,
I wasn't sure I'd ever be back.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.958
Disney bought Fox,
there was a whole

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.125
boring rights issue,

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:49.166
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.833
But then, it turned out
they wanted me,

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:54.958
the one guy who shouldn't
even have his own movie.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.166
Much less a franchise.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.916
Marvel is so stupid!

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:02.000
Look, we know the
title of this thing, so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I know what you're wondering.

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:05.208
How are we going
to do this without

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:07.041
dishonoring Logan's memory?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And I'll tell you how.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:10.875
We're not.

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:12.500
Holy.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.791
I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.

00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:17.250
Wolverine is not dead.

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:21.000
Sure, it made for a perfect
ending to a very sad story,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but that's not how
regenerative healing factors work.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.708
You think I want
to be out here in

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.708
beautiful downtown
North Dakota,

00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:29.375
digging up the one
and only Wolverine?

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:30.458
No, thank you.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.125
But the fate of my
entire world is at stake.

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:35.041
He may not be living
his best life, but

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:37.833
he sure as hell ain't dead.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.333
Bingo.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.500
Yahtzee.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.416
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.166
Damn it!

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.833
Son of a bitch!

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:09.166
Fuck! Motherfucker!

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.333
My world is fucked!

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.458
That was weird.

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:15.958
I'm much calmer now.

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:19.000
Look, I'm not a man of science,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.416
but you seem incredibly
passed away.

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:27.416
But it's good to see ya.

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:30.083
I gotta be honest,
I've always wanted to

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:30.791
ride with you, Log'.

00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:34.416
You and me getting into a
Deadpool and a Wolverine.

00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:36.083
Just fucking shit up.

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:41.041
Can you imagine the fun,
the chaos, the residuals?

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:42.375
G'day mate!

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.375
There's nothing that'll bring me back to

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.958
life faster than a
big bag of Marvel cash.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.791
Me too, Hugh.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.750
No, no, no, no.

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:57.416
Ugh, he had to get all
noble and die for real.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.291
God damn it!

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:05.000
I could really use
your help right now.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.833
Wait!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I'm warning you!
I'm not alone!

00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.291
Wade Winston Wilson!

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:22.833
You're under arrest by
the Time Variance Authority.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.708
With too many crimes
for this, come out!

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:27.791
We're giving you the courtesy...

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.458
Death by day player.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.541
Last chance!

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.458
Throw out your weapons
and come out peacefully!

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.208
I'm not gonna give you my weapons!

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:38.416
But I promise not to use them.

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:42.083
There are 206 bones
in the human body.

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:44.541
207 if I'm watching
Gossip Girl.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:47.000
Here we go, maximum effort.

00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:42.375
I am soaking wet right now.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.541
To be clear, I'm not
proud of any of this.

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:50.500
The wanton violence,
the whiff of necrophilia,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.125
it isn't who I am, it
isn't who I wanna be.

00:06:53.583 --> 00:06:54.500
Who I wanna be?

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:56.458
Well, to help you understand that,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.500
I gotta take you back.

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.041
My little joy ride I took
through space and time,

00:07:00.416 --> 00:07:03.166
to the day that
changed everything.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.791
I can't believe I'm finally here.

00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:19.541
I've waited for this
moment for so long.

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:23.000
Thank you, sir, for seeing me.

00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:28.208
I firmly believe that my
services could be of great use

00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:29.083
to your organization.

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:31.916
Now, I know I was
caught smash-turbating

00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:33.166
in the lobby of Stark Tower.

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:33.875
Smash-turbating?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.375
I'm sure you did that.

00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:35.833
I'm sorry, what was that?

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:36.458
No, I'm sorry.

00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.291
That's when you get
those toy hulk hands, right?

00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:41.791
And then you just, you
look down and you just,

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.958
you brace yourself and
you ravage the midsection.

00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.333
I get it, okay, thank you.
The picture's painted.

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:49.000
You get the gist.

00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:51.000
What exactly brings
you here today?

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.166
Well, okay, I care.

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:59.125
I know I turn
everything into a joke,

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:03.875
but I care and I want
to use that feeling

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.125
for something important.

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:08.875
I want to matter.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.083
And to show
my girl that I matter.

00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:17.500
And, you know,
I feel like I'm wasting

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.375
the good stuff here.

00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:20.250
Is the man not going
to be joining us?

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:20.458
The man?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.833
Yeah, I should say
this if he's going to.

00:08:23.166 --> 00:08:24.208
As far as you can tell

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:25.583
right now, I'm the man.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.750
The man is me.

00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:29.708
I am the man
in this circumstance.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.250
And he doesn't do this
kind of thing anymore.

00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:33.791
- Cameos?
- Meetings.

00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:35.250
Entry-level meetings.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.208
Entry-level?

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:39.500
Aren't you the chauffeur, maybe?

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:40.500
Common misconception,

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.375
I did begin my career
as Mr. Stark's driver.

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:46.000
I quickly pivoted to
the head of security.

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:46.916
The head of security?

00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:48.458
The head of security, of
course, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.333
And while I am
vetting your resume.

00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:53.125
You seem to have
left out whether or not

00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:55.333
you had any experience
as a member of a team.

00:08:55.708 --> 00:08:57.625
Could you maybe add a
little bit of perspective?

00:08:58.041 --> 00:08:59.125
Oh, yes, of course.

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:01.750
I was Special Forces,
but I was mainly,

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.000
I was team leader,
founder, really, of X-Force.

00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:06.083
Sadly, they all perished in action.

00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:07.375
How exactly did that happen?

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:10.875
Well, the police say
gravity, but just between us,

00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:12.416
they didn't test well in
the focus group.

00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:13.625
Particularly Cable.

00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:16.541
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I
can see this isn't going on.

00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:17.041
Please stop writing.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.416
I'm just, I want to be an Avenger.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.875
I want to be an Avenger.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.333
Why do you want to be an Avenger?

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.833
Look around you, I mean,
they're the best of the best.

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:33.416
And what they do matters.
I need to be an Avenger.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.291
Sir, that girl is kind
of had a bit of a shtick,

00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:39.375
and if I don't, you
know, turn things around

00:09:39.375 --> 00:09:42.083
and do something with my gifts,
I don't think it's going

00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:44.208
to really work out for me,
and I wouldn't blame her.

00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:49.791
Avengers are a very
unique group of superheroes

00:09:49.791 --> 00:09:52.541
that stand for something
more than just fighting

00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:53.958
and wearing costumes.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.958
I mean, people look up to us.
Kids look up to us.

00:09:57.291 --> 00:09:57.875
I'm sorry, us?

00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:00.333
I wasn't aware that
you were an Avenger.

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.500
Avengers adjacent, technically.

00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:04.500
Oh, what's your superpower?
Is it parallel parking?

00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:07.333
I am so sorry.
That was cruel.

00:10:07.791 --> 00:10:09.791
I lash out when I'm nervous.
It won't happen again.

00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:11.208
- Let's cut to the chase.
- Please.

00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:12.750
You just said moments ago

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.333
that you wanted to be an Avenger

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.875
because you need it.

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:18.125
Yes, sir, I do.

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:21.500
But the Avengers don't do
the job because they need it.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.291
They do the job because
people need them.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.791
Do you see the distinction?

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.458
Yes, sir.

00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:32.358
Please, Mr. Hogan,
I don't want to spend

00:10:32.359 --> 00:10:34.829
the rest of my life like
an annoying one-trick pony.

00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:38.933
All right.

00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.000
Oh, my God.
You're standing.

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:43.458
Yeah, now's the time that we stand.

00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:44.291
Damn it.

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:45.666
The problem might be that

00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:47.916
you're reaching a little too high.

00:10:48.583 --> 00:10:50.125
Aim for the middle
and you'll never miss.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.041
I think you got a good heart.
I believe what you're saying.

00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:55.833
But not everybody's
a world-saving type.

00:10:55.833 --> 00:10:58.375
I'm not.
I'm happy. Right?

00:10:58.625 --> 00:10:59.500
I found my place.

00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:01.458
Find your place.

00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.125
All right.
Get back out there.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.000
We'll keep an eye on you.
Good luck.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.458
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:13.708
Fetch the car.
I want to hit Shake Shack.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.458
Rejection makes me hung-y.

00:11:17.083 --> 00:11:18.125
No, no, no. Please.

00:11:18.666 --> 00:11:19.958
No, no, no. Okay.

00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:24.000
You know what they say?

00:11:24.666 --> 00:11:25.791
When one door closes,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.583
your locker at work opens.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.125
Let's go sell some certified

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:41.958
pre-owned vehicles, motherf--

00:11:44.416 --> 00:11:46.833
Technically, the
carnival's not a minivan.

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:49.625
It's an MPV.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.333
So how does the Kia
compare to the Honda Odyssey?

00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:53.750
The Odyssey?
That's a great question.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.250
It doesn't fucking suck.

00:11:56.166 --> 00:11:58.208
You know, you can answer
the question without swearing.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.416
I'm sorry, Tammy.
I don't have kids.

00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:02.416
Not that I haven't dreamt of that.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.583
You don't have a lot of vaginal sex.

00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:09.916
- You'll get them next time, pal.
- Yeah.

00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.291
And look, you can always
go back to super-heroing.

00:12:12.583 --> 00:12:14.333
I mean, I know I'd like to
see you back in the suit.

00:12:15.208 --> 00:12:17.500
I don't keep it in my locker
so that I can wear it.

00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:20.708
I keep it in my locker in case
we need to settle up again.

00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:23.375
Hey, hey, hey.
What is that doing in there?

00:12:24.208 --> 00:12:24.500
I'm done.

00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:27.000
I'm done.

00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:30.208
And I'm fine with being done.

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:32.125
Look, is sales the best match?

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:32.916
Probably not.

00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:35.291
Is this the life that
I always imagined for myself?

00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:36.208
Fuck no!

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.708
This is the right fit for me.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.500
- Sugar Bear, it is.
- Okay, Mr. Wilson.

00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:45.416
I'm just saying, once a month,
we could go on a little mission.

00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.125
We're human beings.
We crave purpose.

00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.333
After all, we're Deadpool.

00:12:50.833 --> 00:12:53.250
Please stop saying that.
We're not Deadpool.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.583
I'm not even Deadpool anymore.

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.333
Well, if we're gonna have
a midlife crisis, go big.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.458
A few years ago, a friend of
mine got his nipples pierced

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.583
with a titanium chain that goes down
and attaches to his Van Johnson.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.833
Are you feeling "Grumplestiltskin"
because it's your birthday?

00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:15.250
What?

00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:17.166
No.

00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:19.125
No.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.850
Surprise!

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.000
Hey, you guys are
lucky I'm not armed.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.458
Get in here.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.666
This was six years ago.
You'd all be dead.

00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:35.041
So then, he gets out of the cab,
and you would not believe it.

00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:37.166
I turn around, and what do I find?

00:13:37.208 --> 00:13:38.250
- Airpods.
- Airpods!

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.333
- Crazy stories.
- Every time.

00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.208
- Come on.
- Every single time.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:45.791
Make any sales today?

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.916
You know I didn't.

00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:50.833
Did you sell any dreamcatchers
on Etsy or whatever it is you do?

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.916
The rent is due in 3 days Wade,

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:54.500
... and I can't keep carrying you.
- Relax.

00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:57.583
I have the money.
I sold some old blood

00:13:57.583 --> 00:13:59.250
pressure medication
I found lying around.

00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:01.250
You're trying to kill me,
motherfucker.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.541
I'm not the one dousing
everything in salt, motherfucker.

00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:06.958
I pray every day that fire finds your

00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.916
body and finishes the job

00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:11.083
God didn't have the nuts to do.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.125
That's hurtful. If you could
hear the look on my face,

00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:14.625
you'd smell how sad I am.

00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:15.625
You watching me good?

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.458
Great British break-off.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.833
Oh, God damn.

00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:21.500
That show stood between me
and suicide for ten years.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:22.333
Those are my feelings.

00:14:22.791 --> 00:14:24.583
On abortion, religious freedom, animal

00:14:24.583 --> 00:14:26.708
rights, privacy rights, vaccines, free

00:14:26.708 --> 00:14:28.375
market capitalism, global climate change.

00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:30.625
No, no, no, no, no speaking lines Buck.

00:14:31.708 --> 00:14:33.375
Hi, you, Kyo. Hi, Wade.

00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:35.208
Nice, fake o'clock shadow.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.583
It's a summer balayage from the French.

00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.041
It's meant to mimic the natural

00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:42.750
highlights of the sun.

00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:44.458
It's a toupee. It's a hair system.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.083
I love your hair system, Wade.

00:14:47.375 --> 00:14:47.875
Thank you.

00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.416
- Want to do some cocaine?
- Hey, cocaine is

00:14:51.416 --> 00:14:52.083
the one thing that

00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:53.458
Feig said is off-limits.

00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:55.750
- What about Bolivian watching?
- They know

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.500
all the slang terms. They have a list.

00:14:57.791 --> 00:14:59.416
- Even snowboarding?
- Even disco dust.

00:14:59.458 --> 00:15:01.125
- White girl interrupted?
- Even Forrest Bump.

00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:02.000
- Bugger Sugar.
- I wouldn't...

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.333
...even try powdered gonuts.

00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:04.000
Do you want to build a...

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.458
...snowman?
- Yes, but I can't.

00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:10.166
- Hold here.
- Here?

00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:13.458
- What happened?
- That's the Fun part.

00:15:14.041 --> 00:15:16.708
- Thanks for coming. - Yeah.

00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:19.583
- How's work?
- Oh, I got a promotion.

00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:22.375
- No way.
- Yeah.

00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:24.041
It's mind-numbing middle

00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:25.166
management, but I'm happy.

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:26.000
That's great.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.791
- You seeing anyone?
- How are you?

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:33.666
Um, yeah. Guy from work.

00:15:34.875 --> 00:15:35.833
- Dermit.
- Dermit?

00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:37.916
- He's kind.
- Good.

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:38.916
Likes to go hiking.

00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:41.250
Hasn't gotten me shot yet.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.375
Well... It's the early days.

00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:49.291
How about you? You seeing anyone?

00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:51.625
No, no, I live in a one-bedroom

00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:53.500
apartment. Share bed with Blind Al.

00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:58.500
- All right.
- All right.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.291
Happy birthday to you.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.500
Okay, okay, okay.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.750
Birthdays.

00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:10.916
Every spin around the moon

00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:12.000
is a new adventure indeed.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.041
- Sun, dumbass!
- Okay, round-earther!

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.875
- Where was I?
- The Adventure of Life.

00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:20.625
Right. It's been a
challenging few years.

00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:22.958
I haven't seen
you guys in a while.

00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.833
Been through a lot.
Change of life.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.000
- Menopause?
- Bitch, are you improv-ing?

00:16:29.916 --> 00:16:31.333
I'm sorry that you had
to see that, Yukio.

00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:35.291
But I'm happy.

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:38.083
You know, that's because of

00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:40.000
each and every one of you.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:42.000
I guess what
I'm trying to say is how

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.875
proud I am, how grateful I am,

00:16:43.875 --> 00:16:45.833
to be standing in a room with every

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:47.666
single person I love.

00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:54.916
I'm the luckiest man alive.

00:16:57.541 --> 00:16:59.458
- Make a wish, buddy.
- 10-4, good buddy.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.166
Going down.

00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.208
- Wade Wilson?
- Oh, yeah. Dancers.

00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:13.500
Dopinder must
have ordered you.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.583
Are those supposed
to be cop costumes?

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.875
Never mind. Take your clothes off,
but leave the helmets.

00:17:18.875 --> 00:17:22.208
And this isn't Pretty Woman,
we're kissing...

00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:23.875
What song do you
guys normally dance to?

00:17:25.375 --> 00:17:26.666
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:17:26.666 --> 00:17:27.458
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.500
Is that supposed to be scary?

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:32.708
Pegging isn't new for me
friend-o, but it is for Disney.

00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:36.666
Look, I've never
been a natural bottom.

00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:38.750
So we're going to
take things real slow,

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:40.916
and I want some
crazy eye contact.

00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:42.250
Not you, you.

00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:43.458
I can't see your eyes through

00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:44.625
the mask, but I can feel it.

00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:45.958
We're going to move
on down the hallway

00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.250
so we can spare a
cleanup on Isle Hassel.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.791
How does everyone
feel about this plan?

00:17:49.791 --> 00:17:51.083
- I don't like you.
- Yes.

00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:52.291
Let's hold on to that attitude,

00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:54.000
and we're going to do it angry.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:13.416
Mr. Wilson.

00:18:15.833 --> 00:18:18.333
You appear to have soiled
yourself while unconscious.

00:18:18.791 --> 00:18:20.541
I wasn't unconscious.
Who are you?

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:24.458
I go by the name of Paradox,
Mr. Paradox,

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.333
and you're sitting here at the TVA,
the Time Variance Authority.

00:18:29.125 --> 00:18:31.208
We're really a
watchdog organization.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.041
Except we're more
lighthearted than that sounds,

00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:37.000
with sort of throwback ironic twist.

00:18:37.541 --> 00:18:39.416
And we're in charge
of defending what's

00:18:39.416 --> 00:18:41.750
known as
the sacred timeline.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.291
Holy fuck, that is a shit ton of
exposition for a three-quel.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.666
Is this because I used
Cable's Time Machine

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:48.875
brought a couple of
people back to life,

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:50.166
then I destroyed it.

00:18:50.166 --> 00:18:51.166
That was a long time ago.

00:18:51.333 --> 00:18:53.458
Yes, we're aware of your
abuse of your timeline.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.708
You were so abusive of it.

00:18:57.083 --> 00:19:00.000
No, it has nothing to do
with that. Walk with me.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.291
I brought you here,
Mr. Wilson, to tell

00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:10.375
you that you're special.

00:19:11.291 --> 00:19:14.458
In fact, you've been chosen
for a higher purpose,

00:19:14.458 --> 00:19:16.375
a purpose unclear even to me,

00:19:16.583 --> 00:19:21.458
but one that could save
the entire sacred timeline

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.291
from a possibly grisly
fate sometime in the future,

00:19:24.666 --> 00:19:28.750
which may very well
need to be avenged.

00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:32.416
This sacred timeline,
I assume I'm going

00:19:32.416 --> 00:19:37.000
to marvel at how
cinematic it feels,

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.666
gratuitous cameos, indiscriminate use
of variants, the whole package?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.583
Oh, you tell me.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.250
Cap...

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.333
You are no longer lost, Wade.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.458
You can be a hero among heroes.

00:20:04.541 --> 00:20:06.500
We've been surveilling
you for quite a while.

00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:07.583
The subway station.

00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:09.250
A TVA outpost, yes.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.583
And what is that?

00:20:13.833 --> 00:20:16.375
Is that me? Is that Thor?

00:20:18.041 --> 00:20:18.458
Is he crying?

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.708
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.833
That happens in the distant future.

00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:23.541
Why is Thor crying?

00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:25.541
Do not speak to her.
Stop that.

00:20:25.541 --> 00:20:27.791
I brought you here to
offer you an opportunity,

00:20:28.375 --> 00:20:30.458
the opportunity you
sought years ago but

00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:31.583
for which you were not ready.

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:33.333
We believe you're ready now,

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:35.375
ready for a chance
to leave your timeline

00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:38.250
and join the greatest
universe of all.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.041
I am about to give you the
thing you've always wanted.

00:20:40.041 --> 00:20:41.500
I smell what you're stepping in.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.083
The power in the Marvel Universe
is about to change forever.

00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:47.500
I am the Messiah.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.625
I am...

00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:54.625
Marvel Jesus.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.208
Excuse me.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.000
Just goin' over here.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.208
Suck it, Fox.

00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:04.666
I'm going to Disneyland.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.416
Get fucked!

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:10.875
Where do I sign?

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:12.541
Oh, no need for paper work.

00:21:12.541 --> 00:21:14.625
Good. Not to brag,
but I do not read.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.791
There is one thing
I will need, though.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.833
Oh, fuck off.

00:21:24.666 --> 00:21:25.875
Adorn me, Beardo.

00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:47.750
Fuckin-A!

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.000
It's perfect.

00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:53.500
FYI, your tailor is a
predator, but I love it.

00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:56.497
Snug, no camel toe,
new car smell,

00:21:56.498 --> 00:21:59.921
and adamantium katanas?
You shouldn't have.

00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:02.375
Go ahead.
Take it in.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.166
And yes, your underwear
is getting tighter.

00:22:05.666 --> 00:22:06.958
That guy knows what
I'm talking about.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.333
His clothes say
middle management

00:22:09.333 --> 00:22:11.375
but his eyes say fucky-fucky.

00:22:11.833 --> 00:22:13.208
Yes, you look very nice.

00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:15.708
Nice? Your buddy here
is ready to throw

00:22:15.708 --> 00:22:16.833
it all away for me.

00:22:16.833 --> 00:22:17.500
You calling your wife?

00:22:17.916 --> 00:22:18.083
HR.

00:22:18.083 --> 00:22:19.166
Is your wife working HR?

00:22:19.458 --> 00:22:21.416
I'm really glad you're
taking this so well.

00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:23.458
Oh, I'm taking it well.

00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:26.333
I have never had a
problem traveling for work.

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:28.083
That said, we should
talk vacation days.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.041
I'm more of a one-week-on,
one-week-off kind of guy.

00:22:31.041 --> 00:22:32.041
I think it's what
they do in Denmark.

00:22:32.666 --> 00:22:34.583
You'll never see a Danish
flag in the moon, but...

00:22:35.208 --> 00:22:36.208
God damn it,
they're happy.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.333
Now, let's power up your
little Amazon Fire Phone there

00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:41.458
and zip me back home so
I can let my friends know

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.416
that they've been
upgraded... to Disciples.

00:22:43.958 --> 00:22:46.500
Yep. You don't quite understand.

00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:49.416
You will not be
returning to your home

00:22:49.416 --> 00:22:51.833
because there will be
no home to return to.

00:22:52.125 --> 00:22:53.916
Come again,
this time in my ears?

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.125
This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.

00:23:02.041 --> 00:23:05.000
That is what happens
when a universe

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.083
loses their anchor-being.

00:23:07.333 --> 00:23:09.416
See how it decays
from the inside?

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.791
This is how a reality dies.

00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:12.500
What's an anchor-being?

00:23:12.708 --> 00:23:14.916
An anchor-being is an entity
of such vital importance

00:23:14.916 --> 00:23:17.083
that when they die,
their whole world

00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:19.041
slowly withers out of existence.

00:23:19.916 --> 00:23:22.041
You've just won the
lottery because I didn't die.

00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:24.500
It's just a little midlife crisis,
I'm better now.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.916
Oh, my God!

00:23:32.291 --> 00:23:33.541
Oh, not to laugh.

00:23:33.541 --> 00:23:36.083
Can you imagine if you
were the anchor-being?

00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:36.458
Yeah.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.458
No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.416
Your anchor-being died in
an act of self-sacrifice

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.125
so epic that it sent
shivers down the timeline.

00:23:48.875 --> 00:23:56.125
I am referring, of course,
to Logan, the Wolverine.

00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:15.708
Oh, this is what it feels like.

00:24:17.125 --> 00:24:17.725
Logan.

00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:19.808
Of course.

00:24:25.666 --> 00:24:27.500
The guy forks for hands!

00:24:28.208 --> 00:24:28.708
That Wolverine!

00:24:30.708 --> 00:24:31.500
Yeah, I got it.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.166
You can turn your retro
graphics of death off now.

00:24:34.166 --> 00:24:34.458
Make it stop.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.291
We're not doing it,
Mr. Wilson.

00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:37.583
We certainly can't stop it.

00:24:39.625 --> 00:24:40.500
How long have we got?

00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:42.875
In most cases,
a couple thousand years.

00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:43.958
Well, sweet.

00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:46.166
Most cases aren't
fast enough, not for me.

00:24:46.875 --> 00:24:47.625
What does that mean?

00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:50.625
It means that I have
been tasked with

00:24:50.625 --> 00:24:52.750
overseeing the
end of your universe

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.166
and regardless of
what the pencil pushers

00:24:54.166 --> 00:24:55.166
upstairs would prefer,

00:24:55.666 --> 00:24:59.000
I will not waste my
life watching it die

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.208
slowly of natural causes.

00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:02.291
We used to just
prune these things,

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.458
simple, elegant, efficient,

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.250
but I'm told the TVA doesn't
like to do that anymore.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.041
Well, I do.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.958
And no matter what my
so-called superiors say,

00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:11.625
the multiverse does
not need a babysitter.

00:25:11.625 --> 00:25:13.291
We need a mercy killer.

00:25:13.583 --> 00:25:17.333
And in this instance,
I am the mercy killer.

00:25:21.875 --> 00:25:24.708
What in the macguffin is that?

00:25:24.708 --> 00:25:26.666
That's a time-ripper, Mr. Wilson.

00:25:27.208 --> 00:25:28.125
An accelerant.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.708
Once completed,
it will allow me to

00:25:30.708 --> 00:25:33.100
destroy the space-time
matrix of your universe.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.750
You see, I don't want
to work for the TVA.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.875
I want to be the TVA.

00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:39.958
And the first step
involves showing this

00:25:39.958 --> 00:25:43.000
organization how much more
efficient it can become.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.625
I will be giving your universe a swift
and compassionate end.

00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:48.541
And don't worry, your
friends won't feel a thing.

00:25:48.541 --> 00:25:49.583
It'll be over just like this.

00:25:49.583 --> 00:25:50.166
Oh, what's that?

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:52.325
Trust me.

00:26:05.708 --> 00:26:07.333
You're gonna Old Yeller
my fucking universe?

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:09.666
In your parlance, yes.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.250
Two in the heart,
one in the head.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.000
Look, Mr. Wilson,
you have two choices.

00:26:13.708 --> 00:26:15.208
You can either rejoin
your loved ones and

00:26:15.208 --> 00:26:18.541
collectively cease to
exist in, let's say, 72 hours,

00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:22.500
or you join the sacred timeline.

00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:26.333
And you end your days of
insignificance and mediocrity.

00:26:27.541 --> 00:26:28.041
Wade.

00:26:28.875 --> 00:26:32.700
Wade, you can finally...
finally matter.

00:26:43.333 --> 00:26:44.791
That's all I've ever really wanted.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:45.708
I know.

00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:47.541
I know.

00:26:49.083 --> 00:26:52.041
And you know, I'm nothing
if not morally flexible.

00:26:55.041 --> 00:26:55.791
Yep, yep.

00:26:58.541 --> 00:26:59.166
I'll do it.

00:26:59.625 --> 00:27:00.125
Wise choice.

00:27:00.625 --> 00:27:01.458
The sacred timeline is
happy to have you.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.916
I was talking about
finding the Wolverine

00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:05.500
and breaking your fucking nose.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.541
Find him.

00:27:20.666 --> 00:27:21.125
Find him!

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.333
And boy, did he ever.

00:27:24.583 --> 00:27:26.291
Which brings us back to this.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.208
The desecration of
the sacred corpse.

00:27:37.708 --> 00:27:39.875
Ow, my own fucking arm.

00:27:43.708 --> 00:27:46.625
- Now we're talking!
- Not like this!

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.541
I'm sorry!
"Wolverineing" is hard!

00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:52.458
Make it stop!

00:27:52.791 --> 00:27:53.541
Mangold tried!

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.250
You sick fuck!

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.000
Logan was a hero
and the only thing

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.541
worth a shit to ever
come out of Canada!

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.000
Get my country's name

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
out of your fucking mouth.

00:28:16.416 --> 00:28:17.041
And my sword.

00:28:17.583 --> 00:28:18.333
Gimme that.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.541
Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.

00:28:24.458 --> 00:28:25.458
An alive one.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.791
Don't get up, guys.
I'll see myself out.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:35.950
Logan!

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.375
I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

00:28:42.708 --> 00:28:43.708
Who's asking?

00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:47.833
Well, look at this little
"Hairy Lou Retton".

00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:49.875
Did you stick the
landing, little guy?

00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:53.458
Yes, you did,
comic-accurate short king.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.708
Such a cute wi-dou, wovee.

00:28:55.958 --> 00:28:57.791
Cue the fucking montage, baby.

00:28:58.333 --> 00:29:01.083
Oh boy! Everything
seems to be on fire.

00:29:01.541 --> 00:29:02.208
You have a dragon?

00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:05.458
Ooh, you have anchor-being
written all over.

00:29:15.791 --> 00:29:16.083
Patch.

00:29:18.083 --> 00:29:19.458
Now we're talking.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.500
Ooh, yeah.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.833
That's the whole
goddamn package right there.

00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:28.875
I'm auditioning anchor-beings.

00:29:29.458 --> 00:29:31.916
Oh, that's gonna need
some coconut oil.

00:29:36.166 --> 00:29:38.000
What in the fuck?

00:29:38.458 --> 00:29:39.541
Are you okay?

00:29:40.458 --> 00:29:41.375
Oh, yes, yes.

00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:43.875
Classic John Byrne
brown and tan...

00:29:43.875 --> 00:29:45.583
Now, you fought the
Hulk in this outfit, no?

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.458
I'm Marvel Jesus, you dull
creature, and I will not--

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.500
It's not you... we're just going
in a different direction.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.041
You know, from behind,
you look a little bit like Henry--

00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:10.000
Oh, my fuck!

00:30:10.666 --> 00:30:13.458
The Cavillrine.
The legends are true.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.583
And may I say, sir,
on behalf of all humanity,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.375
this just feels right.

00:30:18.916 --> 00:30:20.458
We will treat you
so much better than

00:30:20.458 --> 00:30:22.041
those shit-fucks
down the street

00:30:22.041 --> 00:30:23.000
You were just leaving.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.583
No, sir, not while the
fate of my universe is at--

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.416
This one looks promising.

00:30:32.125 --> 00:30:32.583
Down you go.

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:34.875
Again.

00:30:36.333 --> 00:30:38.250
I told you, you're not welcome here.

00:30:38.666 --> 00:30:39.500
You're not welcome anywhere.

00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:41.458
Now get the fuck out of my bar.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.583
Just give me one more

00:30:42.583 --> 00:30:43.583
drink and then I'll leave.

00:30:44.333 --> 00:30:45.250
That's not how it works.

00:30:46.041 --> 00:30:48.000
It does now.
Leave the bottle.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.291
I know you, bub?

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.208
Nope. But I know you.

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:53.083
Everybody knows me.

00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:55.708
I'm the Wolverine.

00:30:56.166 --> 00:31:00.750
Yes, you are, and I'm gonna need
you to come with me right now.

00:31:02.041 --> 00:31:03.416
Look, lady,
I'm not interested.

00:31:03.416 --> 00:31:04.416
Really getting into your cuffs--

00:31:04.416 --> 00:31:05.875
Why would I go with you?

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.250
Because, unfortunately,
I need you.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.250
And even more unfortunately,
my entire world needs you.

00:31:15.166 --> 00:31:16.375
You two gonna fuck or fight?

00:31:20.833 --> 00:31:21.875
You gonna take that from him?

00:31:22.283 --> 00:31:22.791
Yep.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.958
I can tell you that sort

00:31:24.958 --> 00:31:26.000
of don't get too close,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.625
I'll only break your
heart by going here.

00:31:27.958 --> 00:31:29.083
But every other
Wolverine would have

00:31:29.083 --> 00:31:30.333
really hurt me by now.

00:31:30.333 --> 00:31:32.958
And I'm sort of on the tic-tic,
so, upsy-daisy, here we go.

00:31:36.625 --> 00:31:36.916
Oh.

00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:42.041
Whiskey-dick of the claws.
It's quite common in Wolverines over 40.

00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:42.583
You don't want this.

00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:43.833
You're right. I don't.

00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:45.208
And you don't want this.

00:31:45.625 --> 00:31:48.000
Unless you want to take a deep breath
through your fucking forehead...

00:31:48.375 --> 00:31:49.583
I suggest you reconsider.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.208
Let's go, Peanut.

00:31:56.083 --> 00:31:57.958
Oh, hold-on, hold-on.

00:31:58.625 --> 00:31:59.041
Watch this.

00:32:00.625 --> 00:32:00.958
All right.

00:32:01.833 --> 00:32:03.708
That's a little... easy.

00:32:07.958 --> 00:32:08.541
Good God.

00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:11.291
Thirsty little honey-badger,
aren't you?

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.291
It's okay. Keep going.

00:32:14.208 --> 00:32:16.000
Audiences are
accustomed to long run times.

00:32:20.866 --> 00:32:22.958
I guess you'll have to do...

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:24.375
Okay.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:26.708
Ooh.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.291
Look at those jammies.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.666
That only took 20 fucking years.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.458
One anchor-being coming right up!

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.291
On your left, baby girl.

00:32:37.083 --> 00:32:40.041
This Logan has the same...
"he can do anything even musicals"-look.

00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:42.666
Bonus! He's actually
wearing a costume

00:32:42.666 --> 00:32:44.875
like he's not embarrassed to be on
a superhero movie for once.

00:32:45.375 --> 00:32:46.375
I don't understand.

00:32:46.666 --> 00:32:47.750
You said my universe is dying,

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.541
because this sack of
nuts got himself killed.

00:32:50.791 --> 00:32:52.083
Well, problem solved.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.166
My God.

00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:56.250
You actually think
you can replace an

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.291
anchor-being with this?

00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:02.250
I wouldn't have accepted any
other Wolverine B-T-Dubs,

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.708
but you have outdone
yourself and brought

00:33:04.708 --> 00:33:06.250
me the worst Wolverine.

00:33:06.583 --> 00:33:07.500
What do you mean the worst one?

00:33:07.875 --> 00:33:10.250
Mr. Wilson, this Wolverine...

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.416
let down his entire world.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.208
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

00:33:15.708 --> 00:33:19.125
And what he did...
well, some things are

00:33:19.125 --> 00:33:20.125
just beyond forgiveness.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.625
Okay. How do I make this right?
I'll do anything.

00:33:27.333 --> 00:33:30.083
I gave you a chance at greatness,

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.875
because my superiors
deemed you special.

00:33:32.875 --> 00:33:34.208
Clearly not special in a good way,

00:33:34.208 --> 00:33:37.625
but apparently you have some
important future purpose to serve.

00:33:37.625 --> 00:33:38.666
With Thor, he holds me.

00:33:38.958 --> 00:33:40.500
But I did my duty.

00:33:40.875 --> 00:33:42.708
I gave you the
opportunity to be somebody,

00:33:42.958 --> 00:33:44.958
and instead of accepting
my offering with

00:33:44.958 --> 00:33:47.083
humility and gratitude,
you broke my nose.

00:33:47.583 --> 00:33:48.250
It looks great.

00:33:48.458 --> 00:33:50.500
And decimated dozens
of my men with the

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.833
exumed corpse of a hero,

00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:54.333
dishonoring not only
his remains, but his memory.

00:33:54.333 --> 00:33:55.208
What are you, Internet?

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.416
Your world is dying!

00:33:57.875 --> 00:33:58.458
Thank you very much.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.208
And there's no stopping it.

00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:05.458
The humane thing
to do to make it quick!

00:34:05.458 --> 00:34:08.291
Is the thought of vaporizing
my universe making you peckish?

00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:09.500
I'm eating my feelings.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.541
I'm about to lose everything
that I've ever cared about,

00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:13.875
because that hairy
thunder cunt from

00:34:13.875 --> 00:34:16.375
down-under cunt finally dies,
and he's standing

00:34:16.375 --> 00:34:17.666
right behind me, isn't he?

00:34:18.333 --> 00:34:19.500
Welcome to the MCU,
by the way.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.458
You're joining at
a bit of a low point.

00:34:22.583 --> 00:34:24.375
As for you,
I want to talk to your boss.

00:34:24.708 --> 00:34:25.458
I want you to get
him on the phone,

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.166
and you tell him,
her, or them that

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:30.083
Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.

00:34:35.666 --> 00:34:36.208
Holy shit.

00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:40.916
I just heard a symphony of
buttholes clenching all at once.

00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:41.916
You're off-grid.

00:34:42.333 --> 00:34:44.875
Your bosses don't know what you
sick fucks are doing down here.

00:34:44.875 --> 00:34:45.541
Well, I'll tell you what.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.416
I have a black belt in Karen, and I'm

00:34:48.416 --> 00:34:49.000
going to go upstairs,

00:34:49.291 --> 00:34:49.916
and I'm going to tell

00:34:49.916 --> 00:34:51.000
them all about you and--

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.458
Oh, silence is nice.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.500
What the fuck did he go?

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.125
To the trash heap.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.166
You'll fit right in.

00:35:00.125 --> 00:35:00.958
That was close.

00:35:22.458 --> 00:35:24.500
Don't just stand there, you ape.

00:35:25.333 --> 00:35:26.958
Give me a hand up.

00:35:28.083 --> 00:35:29.500
No, I'm actually okay.
Thank you!

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.625
Where the hell are we?

00:35:33.625 --> 00:35:34.583
I don't know.

00:35:34.916 --> 00:35:36.291
It looks kind of Mad Maxie.

00:35:36.291 --> 00:35:38.125
But that would be
IP infringement, right?

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.166
Fucking jokes.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.833
Were you even
listening back there?

00:35:46.166 --> 00:35:48.500
We don't make it back to
that Mr. Paradox asshole.

00:35:48.958 --> 00:35:51.250
- Everyone I know is going to die.
- Not my fucking problem!

00:35:52.125 --> 00:35:53.083
Well, is that all you got?

00:35:54.208 --> 00:35:56.291
Is that what you said
when your world went to shit?

00:35:58.958 --> 00:35:59.458
Come again?

00:35:59.833 --> 00:36:01.250
Yeah, I heard all about you.

00:36:01.833 --> 00:36:03.375
How you screwed up everything,

00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:06.541
You should be thanking me for pulling
you out of that bed you shit in.

00:36:06.791 --> 00:36:08.958
You backstabbing son of a bitch!

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.500
Are you ready to be calm now?

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.833
Rest in pieces Fox.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.041
I don't want to fight you, peanut.

00:36:43.458 --> 00:36:44.750
Doesn't matter what you did.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:46.291
I just need your help.

00:36:48.083 --> 00:36:49.583
I don't fucking care.

00:36:59.791 --> 00:37:00.458
This is gonna hurt.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.500
Alright!

00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:07.166
Fuck it!

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.125
Let's give the people
what they came for.

00:37:11.291 --> 00:37:12.291
Let's fucking go.

00:37:14.125 --> 00:37:15.625
Get your special sock out, nerds.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.125
This gonna get good.

00:38:18.325 --> 00:38:19.125
Baby knife!

00:38:24.458 --> 00:38:26.416
Let's see you grow
your fucking head back!

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.583
I can fix it! I can fix it!

00:38:28.583 --> 00:38:30.250
It's what? Whatever it is that you did.

00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:32.458
Whatever made you so bad.

00:38:33.291 --> 00:38:34.375
Those... those...

00:38:34.833 --> 00:38:37.083
Pricks! In the TPA you heard them.

00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:39.625
They have the power
to end my universe.

00:38:39.625 --> 00:38:42.375
But they also have the
power to change yours.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.208
We get back there.

00:38:45.625 --> 00:38:46.875
And we can fix your world.

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:48.225
Together.

00:38:50.125 --> 00:38:50.666
I promise.

00:38:52.666 --> 00:38:53.416
They can fix it.

00:38:55.125 --> 00:38:57.833
Hey!
We fight each other, we lose.

00:38:58.583 --> 00:38:59.458
Dear God, it's him.

00:38:59.708 --> 00:39:01.583
- Who?
- The One.

00:39:02.458 --> 00:39:04.500
The superhero equivalent
to comfort-food or molly.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:08.750
White guy's answer to all their
disappointments and another A-lister.

00:39:09.291 --> 00:39:10.291
Fair warning, gorgeous.

00:39:10.791 --> 00:39:12.583
You're going to encounter
some indelicate language.

00:39:12.875 --> 00:39:16.833
A smidge of ass play, but we've been
prohibited from using cocaine... on camera.

00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:18.583
- They're coming.
- Who's they?

00:39:25.741 --> 00:39:27.250
Oh, they're driving angry.

00:39:32.458 --> 00:39:35.333
Now that's a superhero lead!

00:39:41.858 --> 00:39:43.358
I got this.

00:40:06.875 --> 00:40:07.875
Stay close.

00:40:08.833 --> 00:40:09.666
Aye-aye Captain.

00:40:10.958 --> 00:40:12.208
You got this.

00:40:14.875 --> 00:40:17.875
Cassandra is going to be giddy
when she sees what we caught.

00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:21.041
You can't run.
Everybody knows that.

00:40:21.416 --> 00:40:23.458
You see anyone running,
dick-for-brains?

00:40:24.958 --> 00:40:26.500
You're not going to love
what happens next.

00:40:26.708 --> 00:40:27.625
Oh, oh my God.

00:40:28.833 --> 00:40:30.875
Oh my God
He's going to say it.

00:40:31.208 --> 00:40:33.666
Ha! Oh my God!
He's going to say it!

00:40:33.666 --> 00:40:35.300
- Say, what?
- Avengers, assemb--

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:36.600
Flame on!

00:40:59.333 --> 00:41:00.500
Oh! Fuck!

00:41:05.458 --> 00:41:07.375
- We don't know that guy.
- We thought we did.

00:41:07.916 --> 00:41:09.083
I know you.

00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:10.375
Holy sh--

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:18.000
- Sabretooth, your brother.
- Ready to die!

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.708
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Time!

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.958
You look ridiculous.

00:41:23.833 --> 00:41:26.083
People have waited
decades for this fight.

00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:27.583
It's not going to be easy.

00:41:27.583 --> 00:41:28.041
Baby knife!

00:41:28.041 --> 00:41:29.750
Shoot the double, take him down.

00:41:30.083 --> 00:41:32.083
Side control, then full mount and

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.375
ground and pound 'til he makes
no sound because he's dead.

00:41:35.375 --> 00:41:37.208
- Shut the fuck up.
- Oh my God.

00:41:37.583 --> 00:41:38.916
Okay, good luck.
I'm a huge fan.

00:41:51.916 --> 00:41:52.916
What is it, girl?

00:41:53.416 --> 00:41:54.375
Is there trouble at the well?

00:42:00.541 --> 00:42:01.458
Big trouble.

00:42:02.125 --> 00:42:02.625
Behold!

00:42:03.583 --> 00:42:07.625
The head of your
precious queen, Furiosa!

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:09.833
I have the Wolverine.

00:42:10.833 --> 00:42:13.125
I alone control her.

00:42:13.916 --> 00:42:15.041
You come for me!

00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:18.166
You come for her.

00:42:20.666 --> 00:42:22.416
So sorry. I know
it's pronounced him.

00:42:22.416 --> 00:42:24.291
I'm genderblind.
It's my cross to bear.

00:42:24.458 --> 00:42:25.083
Who's next?

00:42:25.416 --> 00:42:27.041
Toad! You're up.

00:42:35.458 --> 00:42:36.000
Uh-oh.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.125
Holy shi--

00:42:48.791 --> 00:42:49.583
...God of Thunder.

00:42:54.416 --> 00:42:55.250
When was I asleep?

00:42:55.833 --> 00:42:57.000
Not all of you was asleep.

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:58.375
Don't bother.

00:42:59.375 --> 00:43:00.083
They're very thorough.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.875
If you know where
we are, start talking.

00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:04.875
You're in the void.

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:06.916
Think of it as purgatory.

00:43:08.291 --> 00:43:10.083
Reed called it a
metaphysical junkyard

00:43:10.625 --> 00:43:13.876
where anything useless goes before
it gets annihilated forever

00:43:13.877 --> 00:43:18.282
and where the TVA sends people that
don't play nice with the rest of the multiverse.

00:43:18.541 --> 00:43:19.666
- Like you?
- And you.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:20.625
What does the annihilating?

00:43:21.916 --> 00:43:22.716
Alioth.

00:43:23.125 --> 00:43:26.458
Alioth is in this thing?
From Loki season one episode five?

00:43:26.791 --> 00:43:28.416
Everyone here is
on the run from Alioth.

00:43:29.416 --> 00:43:30.208
Most, don't make it.

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.041
There's a resistance though.

00:43:33.166 --> 00:43:35.375
Other people like us
that manage to survive,

00:43:36.166 --> 00:43:39.583
they're hiding out in the border lands
trying to find a way the fuck outta here.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.208
Then that's where we go.

00:43:41.875 --> 00:43:45.458
We? Us? A team?
The answer is yes! Shake on it.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:46.375
Fuck!

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.333
You nicked it! Just got the tip
with your little steak knife.

00:43:49.708 --> 00:43:52.625
These others can help us get back
to the TVA. They can fix things.

00:43:54.916 --> 00:43:55.916
Something funny, Bub?

00:43:56.375 --> 00:43:58.000
She might have
something to say about that.

00:43:58.583 --> 00:43:59.000
Who's she?

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:01.333
In the void.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.333
You're either food for
Alioth or you work for her.

00:45:18.875 --> 00:45:20.458
Oh, Paul Rudd finally aged.

00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:24.000
Oh, you must be this year's
Juggernaut. Thank you!

00:45:24.083 --> 00:45:26.375
I'd keep your voices down.
She don't like the chatter.

00:45:26.666 --> 00:45:28.166
She's gonna love you.

00:45:44.083 --> 00:45:44.875
Is it Charles?

00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:47.750
Hey, hey, Chuck, it's us!

00:45:48.041 --> 00:45:49.000
That's not Chuck.

00:45:49.458 --> 00:45:50.250
Ah, shit.

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.250
Oh, ableism, great.

00:45:53.708 --> 00:45:55.666
That's not gonna go over
well with the woke mob.

00:45:56.208 --> 00:45:57.166
A Wolverine.

00:45:58.083 --> 00:46:00.166
I wondered when
I'd get one of you.

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:02.500
You're one of Xavier's.

00:46:02.541 --> 00:46:03.708
You know him,
you know Chuck?

00:46:04.125 --> 00:46:04.916
Oh, I knew him.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.500
We shared a womb.

00:46:07.333 --> 00:46:10.458
Tried to strangle the sly little
fellow with my umbilical cord.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.666
Amen...
I've never loved roommates.

00:46:13.208 --> 00:46:17.458
Mine's blind, except she could
see cocaine for some reason.

00:46:17.458 --> 00:46:18.708
You wanna chime in,
Your Majesty?

00:46:19.083 --> 00:46:20.375
I'm dying here.

00:46:20.416 --> 00:46:21.000
Who are you?

00:46:21.791 --> 00:46:24.208
Charles Xavier's twin,
Cassandra Nova.

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:25.666
- Bullshit.
- Must've been an anal birth.

00:46:26.625 --> 00:46:27.750
You two are cute.

00:46:28.833 --> 00:46:30.291
I have a good
feeling about this.

00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:35.666
And I've been trying to
catch this little firefly...

00:46:35.666 --> 00:46:38.166
...for years, haven't I, Johnny?

00:46:40.541 --> 00:46:42.083
You picked the wrong
time to make new friends.

00:46:42.458 --> 00:46:44.916
Oh, Johnny told us all about you.

00:46:44.958 --> 00:46:45.708
Maybe shut up now.

00:46:45.708 --> 00:46:47.041
- Yeah, maybe don't
- We were just talking here.

00:46:47.708 --> 00:46:51.000
Yeah, Johnny told us you're a
psychotic, megalomaniacal asshole.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.875
His word's not mine.
Hell bent, on domination and pain.

00:46:55.458 --> 00:46:58.000
- You said all that about me.
- No, no!

00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.541
I didn't say any of that!

00:46:59.541 --> 00:47:00.666
Get some stones, Johnny!

00:47:02.583 --> 00:47:03.750
I'll let her intimidate you.

00:47:04.833 --> 00:47:06.000
Like you said in the convoy.

00:47:06.416 --> 00:47:08.166
This finger-licking, dead inside,

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.166
pixie slab of third-rate
dime store nut milk

00:47:11.291 --> 00:47:15.125
can eat your delicious cinnamon ring
and kick rocks all the way to bald-hell.

00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:18.416
I have never said any of those
words in my entire life!

00:47:18.416 --> 00:47:19.083
The modesty!

00:47:19.541 --> 00:47:23.875
People think I'm a shit-talker,
but this guy... next level.

00:47:23.916 --> 00:47:24.516
What?

00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:27.208
I don't even know what
half of that means!

00:47:27.958 --> 00:47:29.541
My hat's off to you, sir, truly.

00:47:30.125 --> 00:47:33.916
I didn't... he's... that's... I, I, I don't--

00:47:38.591 --> 00:47:40.125
Not my favorite Chris.

00:47:40.125 --> 00:47:42.750
You stupid piece of shit, you
just got him fucking killed!

00:47:43.041 --> 00:47:44.166
Hey, we're all grieving!

00:47:44.666 --> 00:47:46.416
PS, do you know what he
was doing to the budget?

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:50.125
Alioth is hungry.

00:47:52.041 --> 00:47:53.291
There's been some
kind of mistake.

00:47:53.708 --> 00:47:55.375
Big Yellow is a
backup anchor-being,

00:47:55.666 --> 00:47:57.708
and I'm Marvel Jesus,
MJ if you're nasty.

00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:00.458
This may be hard to hear,
but there's another British villain.

00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:03.250
He's gonna destroy my
universe, and I'm gonna stop him.

00:48:03.291 --> 00:48:05.791
Oh, honey, you don't really strike
me as a world-saving type.

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:09.750
Did I hit a nerve?

00:48:10.958 --> 00:48:12.000
I didn't want it to come to this.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:16.000
Either you help us, or my friend
here is gonna sing the entire

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.500
second act of "Music Man",
with zero warmup.

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.291
Where'd you get the chair?

00:48:20.958 --> 00:48:22.958
Once in a while, I do get
a Charles through here.

00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:25.625
Nevermind, though, no.

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:28.416
He didn't care to find me.

00:48:28.916 --> 00:48:31.708
Ah, Gen-Z, and their
trauma-bragging!

00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:34.750
Can't you just stuff it down,
turn it into accomplishment

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:36.333
or cancer like the rest of us?

00:48:36.666 --> 00:48:39.750
But I'm not like the rest of you...
Except maybe the Wolverine.

00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:42.791
Now we could be truly
terrifying together.

00:48:43.166 --> 00:48:44.250
You're that scary, huh?

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:48.666
The TVA certainly thought so.
They sent me here before I could walk.

00:48:49.458 --> 00:48:51.708
And you know, it's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:48:52.666 --> 00:48:53.541
I love it here.

00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:54.708
You live in a garbage dump.

00:48:55.208 --> 00:48:57.541
I think we both know who
lives in the garbage dump.

00:48:58.291 --> 00:48:59.458
The void is a paradise.

00:49:00.166 --> 00:49:03.583
I can wield my power
here without shame.

00:49:04.458 --> 00:49:07.500
Unfortunately, I had no Chales Xavier
to teach me temperance.

00:49:08.333 --> 00:49:09.333
What about your Charles?

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.250
Did he protect you?

00:49:12.375 --> 00:49:13.875
Did he make you feel safe?

00:49:14.583 --> 00:49:16.041
We're mutants, we're never safe.

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:28.500
I don't want the smoke.
I don't have any beef with you.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.458
I just want to save my friends.
I just, I want to go home.

00:49:31.833 --> 00:49:33.958
- Well, the thing is, I could get you home.
- Good.

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.000
But I don't want to.

00:49:35.416 --> 00:49:36.416
Not good.

00:49:39.916 --> 00:49:41.833
What do you want,
Wade Wilson?

00:49:42.375 --> 00:49:45.916
Uh, your fingers are inside me,
but not in a good way.

00:49:46.166 --> 00:49:48.666
My brother could enter
one's mind with a thought.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.208
I have to get my hands dirty.

00:49:51.916 --> 00:49:53.208
Oh, gosh.

00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:55.250
I've got you.

00:49:58.625 --> 00:49:59.375
I've got you.

00:50:05.166 --> 00:50:07.333
You're not here.

00:50:07.875 --> 00:50:11.000
- I'm right here.
- No, you're not, I can't.

00:50:11.125 --> 00:50:12.291
I'm right here.

00:50:12.541 --> 00:50:14.250
Then show me you
gotta do something.

00:50:15.916 --> 00:50:16.750
Show you what?

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.833
Show me you care about
something bigger than you.

00:50:21.458 --> 00:50:23.208
Ever since they turned

00:50:23.208 --> 00:50:24.500
you down, you took a knee.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.125
Baby, you never got back up.

00:50:29.708 --> 00:50:31.083
I know you're going
through something.

00:50:31.875 --> 00:50:33.125
Let me go through it with you.

00:50:35.041 --> 00:50:36.333
- Your crazy matches--
- My crazy...

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.100
Where'd you go?

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:43.000
Oh my God.

00:50:46.583 --> 00:50:47.875
You just say it, okay?

00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:50.500
Say, "I don't want you...

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:51.625
... I don't want to be with you."

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:54.500
Go ahead, say it, say it, say it, say it.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.833
You don't want to be with me.
Tell me that and I'll walk away.

00:50:57.125 --> 00:50:58.083
Say, "I don't want you."

00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:07.833
You'll never fucking matter.

00:51:12.458 --> 00:51:12.858
What?

00:51:14.583 --> 00:51:16.500
You'll never fucking matter.

00:51:23.416 --> 00:51:25.448
You'll

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:27.191
never

00:51:27.192 --> 00:51:29.515
fucking

00:51:29.516 --> 00:51:31.548
matter.

00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:35.375
She never said that.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.041
No, but I bet she thought it.

00:51:40.666 --> 00:51:41.541
You are so mean!

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:44.625
My brain could taste your fingers
and they tasted like hate.

00:51:45.458 --> 00:51:47.750
And we're in God's where's
the intimacy coordinator?

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.041
You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:52.833
Long before you came here.

00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:57.458
This is Baby Knife, she's
gonna fuck you in the face now.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.208
If you want to kill me, it's going
to take more than a little bit.

00:52:00.791 --> 00:52:01.375
How about six?

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.375
Ah, my boy, quick and strong.

00:52:06.208 --> 00:52:08.875
That's my big boy!
Yes you are!

00:52:15.166 --> 00:52:16.541
Well, this has been fun,

00:52:16.916 --> 00:52:18.916
but the big guy needs to
eat and the rent is due.

00:52:22.708 --> 00:52:24.291
By the way, you're the rent.

00:52:47.708 --> 00:52:48.916
- Coming or what?
- Coming!

00:53:09.541 --> 00:53:10.583
What you thinking about?

00:53:10.583 --> 00:53:11.750
Get the fuck off of me.

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:12.166
Shh, shh.

00:53:12.583 --> 00:53:13.250
Almost done.

00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:14.208
Almost done what?

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:17.166
- Getting my knife out of your buttocks.
- Ah, fuck!

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:19.666
Go, get your mind
out of my pants.

00:53:20.208 --> 00:53:20.875
I'm telling Blake.

00:53:21.125 --> 00:53:21.708
New rules.

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:23.583
I talk now.

00:53:23.583 --> 00:53:24.916
That's gonna be very
hard on the audience.

00:53:25.166 --> 00:53:26.458
Shut the fuck up!

00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:28.583
Let me fucking think.

00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:30.625
We gotta get back
to paradox, right?

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:33.608
Right?

00:53:34.541 --> 00:53:36.666
"Je m'excuse"...
Am I allowed to speak now or--

00:53:36.666 --> 00:53:38.208
Just nod, asshole.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:40.600
Right.

00:53:41.458 --> 00:53:44.708
Then we find the Others that poor kid Johnny
was talking about before you got him killed.

00:53:44.958 --> 00:53:46.041
Poor kid!? He's like 50!

00:53:46.375 --> 00:53:48.333
If there's a chance they
know how to get out of here,

00:53:48.333 --> 00:53:52.208
we find him and make those TVA fuckers
fix my shit like you fucking promised.

00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:53.375
I smell Quest.

00:53:56.583 --> 00:53:57.458
I smell food.

00:54:00.583 --> 00:54:04.208
So what made you finally
wear an honest to God costume?

00:54:06.041 --> 00:54:07.708
Mine's red so they
can't see me bleed.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.000
But I can see how
yellow would be useful too.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.083
Have you been
checked for ADHD?

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.041
But I've had several STDs, which
were probably caused by ADHD.

00:54:19.966 --> 00:54:21.541
What are you looking for?

00:54:22.208 --> 00:54:22.808
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

00:54:24.833 --> 00:54:25.666
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:54:25.666 --> 00:54:27.666
That's rubbing alcohol.
You don't wanna drink--

00:54:27.666 --> 00:54:29.166
Yeah, there you go.
Fuck that liver.

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:32.625
Okay.

00:54:33.875 --> 00:54:34.666
What the fuck are those?

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.041
Back in civilian life I wear a toupee.
But nobody knows.

00:54:42.125 --> 00:54:44.000
Everybody knows.

00:54:46.833 --> 00:54:48.166
Wanna talk about what's haunting you

00:54:48.166 --> 00:54:50.250
or should we wait for
a third act flashback?

00:54:51.208 --> 00:54:51.958
Go fuck yourself.

00:54:55.566 --> 00:54:56.166
You know,

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:02.875
in my world, you're... well regarded.

00:55:03.583 --> 00:55:04.541
Yeah, well, not in mine.

00:55:05.875 --> 00:55:07.666
They don't like me
much in mine either.

00:55:07.666 --> 00:55:08.208
You don't say.

00:55:09.416 --> 00:55:10.416
I want it to be something.

00:55:10.625 --> 00:55:13.458
You know, I've...
Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:14.791
Fuck the Avengers.

00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:18.208
I didn't make the cut though.
Same with the X-Men.

00:55:20.666 --> 00:55:22.708
- My girlfriend left me like this.
- You had a girlfriend?

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.200
Yeah.

00:55:25.125 --> 00:55:27.666
Vanessa, when we met,
she was a dancer.

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:32.000
I mean, we had a whole life...
...It was good.

00:55:33.083 --> 00:55:37.791
But oh boy, I just...
...fuck that right up.

00:55:39.041 --> 00:55:40.958
But you, you were an X-Men.

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.000
Fuck that, you were the X-Men.

00:55:45.283 --> 00:55:46.083
The Wolverine

00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:50.083
He's a hero in that world.

00:55:52.541 --> 00:55:55.625
Yeah, well... he ain't shit in mine.

00:56:01.375 --> 00:56:03.291
You said Logan was a hero,
what happened?

00:56:04.666 --> 00:56:05.166
He died.

00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:06.708
How?

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.291
Well, technically you were
chest fucked by a tree,

00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:13.125
but really he just ran out of batteries
trying to save someone.

00:56:13.625 --> 00:56:13.833
Who?

00:56:14.625 --> 00:56:17.458
The shit heels that grew
in a lab called her X-23.

00:56:17.958 --> 00:56:19.541
But she was just a kid.

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.541
A younger, daintier,
somehow meaner version of you.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.458
He died trying to save her.

00:56:25.791 --> 00:56:26.416
It was beautiful.

00:56:27.583 --> 00:56:29.625
Look, "mijo", I know you're hurt.

00:56:30.583 --> 00:56:32.958
My blind, elderly
African-American roommate,

00:56:33.291 --> 00:56:35.791
Blind Al, always says that
pain teaches us who we are.

00:56:36.166 --> 00:56:38.916
Sometimes we need to listen to that
pain instead of running from it.

00:56:38.916 --> 00:56:40.333
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, she's wise.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:42.791
No, no, that's her
name, you call her Blind Al.

00:56:43.375 --> 00:56:43.958
Well, she's blind.

00:57:21.958 --> 00:57:22.750
Look at you.

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:24.166
She's coming with us.

00:57:24.416 --> 00:57:25.000
No, she's not.

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:26.083
Oh, yes, she is.

00:57:26.085 --> 00:57:27.458
- Fuck no.
- Oh, yes

00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:29.583
Sorry about that.

00:57:30.541 --> 00:57:31.166
Come here, girl.

00:57:32.666 --> 00:57:33.125
Who are you?

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:34.416
I'm Deadpool.

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.625
And I guess you're
Deadpool too.

00:57:37.166 --> 00:57:38.750
But in here, everybody
calls me Nicepool.

00:57:39.333 --> 00:57:41.666
Oh my goodness, wait until you
see Ladypool. She is gorgeous!

00:57:42.416 --> 00:57:45.208
She just had a baby too
and... can't even tell.

00:57:45.541 --> 00:57:46.958
I don't think you're
supposed to say that.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:47.500
That's okay.

00:57:48.583 --> 00:57:50.458
- I identify as a feminist.
- Right.

00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:56.416
Are those gold-plated, 50 caliber
Desert Eagle Pistoleros?

00:57:56.416 --> 00:57:58.625
Of course...
To match my ear huggy.

00:57:58.958 --> 00:57:59.541
Can I have them?

00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:02.000
Over my dead body.

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.083
You're fun.

00:58:03.541 --> 00:58:05.708
And I guess you've
already met Mary Puppins.

00:58:05.708 --> 00:58:07.541
AKA Dogpool.

00:58:07.958 --> 00:58:11.541
Be careful where you put your hand.
She's 90% G-Spot, and she'll let you know it.

00:58:12.083 --> 00:58:15.333
You let this little flirt out of
your sight for one second

00:58:15.333 --> 00:58:17.416
and she starts shopping
for a new papa.

00:58:17.958 --> 00:58:20.000
If you can't be a
responsible pet owner,

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.750
then maybe you don't
deserve this little unicorn.

00:58:22.875 --> 00:58:24.250
Guilty on all charges, your honor.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:25.791
Shan't happen again.

00:58:26.125 --> 00:58:27.083
Why are you so nice?

00:58:27.666 --> 00:58:28.833
It costs nothing to be kind.

00:58:29.333 --> 00:58:31.458
- Shutting the fuck up is also free.
- "Caliente".

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:32.000
This is Logan.

00:58:32.541 --> 00:58:35.041
He's usually shirtless, but he's
let himself go since the divorce.

00:58:37.083 --> 00:58:37.833
Where's your mask?

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.500
Come on, guys.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:44.125
Oh, this guy.

00:58:44.625 --> 00:58:46.000
We're looking for
a group of survivors.

00:58:46.416 --> 00:58:47.083
Oh, they're out there.

00:58:47.583 --> 00:58:50.500
But Merk to Merk, you better hope that
you don't run into the Deadpool core.

00:58:50.916 --> 00:58:55.000
Yeah, they're crazy. They will chop you up into
a thousand pieces and hide you all over the void.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.666
If they could only process their childhood trauma,
they'd go on one heck of a healing journey.

00:58:58.708 --> 00:59:00.666
Look, we're headed for the Borderlands.
You know where it is?

00:59:01.125 --> 00:59:03.041
Borderlands, yeah, that's 12 clicks...

00:59:03.625 --> 00:59:05.500
...do West. I can lend
you my ride if you like.

00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:07.075
It would be my honor.

00:59:10.958 --> 00:59:11.666
Oh, no, no, no, no,

00:59:11.666 --> 00:59:12.916
no, no, absolutely not.

00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:14.458
Uh-uh, what the?

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.375
No, no.

00:59:15.375 --> 00:59:17.125
- Just get in the car.
- This isn't a car.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.708
This is a Honda fucking Odyssey.

00:59:20.125 --> 00:59:21.583
Throttle response sucks a cock.

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:23.250
Dated infotainment system.

00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:26.516
When Honda saw that untreated
chlamydia was making a comeback,

00:59:26.517 --> 00:59:28.781
they invented the
Honda Odyssey... to compete.

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:31.750
Get in the fucking car.

00:59:32.166 --> 00:59:33.416
She'll get you there
safe and sound.

00:59:34.083 --> 00:59:35.532
Ol' Betsy always does.

00:59:35.533 --> 00:59:38.375
You're gonna have to
give him a dog back though.

00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:41.375
I know, listen.
Yes child.

00:59:41.791 --> 00:59:44.250
If you ever wanna give her up,
or if she needs a new home,

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:47.166
or if something should happen to you,
I'd love to be her papa.

00:59:48.083 --> 00:59:49.500
What would ever happen to me?

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:50.708
Lots of stuff.

00:59:54.875 --> 00:59:56.333
No, we're running away.

00:59:56.625 --> 00:59:59.291
Don't, the corn was too dense, girl.

01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:01.416
Fuck!

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.208
Okay, I'm just gonna ask.

01:00:32.458 --> 01:00:33.208
What's with the suit?

01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:36.041
First thing I did when I flamed out,
I took mine off.

01:00:36.083 --> 01:00:37.500
- Drop it.
- It's not that ugly.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.000
- Stop talking about my sui--.
- Did you make it yourself?

01:00:39.416 --> 01:00:40.875
- Been there.
- Quit now.

01:00:40.875 --> 01:00:43.708
The X-Men make you wear it?
Those sons of fucking bitches.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:45.833
They are not your friends,
I'll tell you that.

01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:47.980
Friends don't let friends
leave the house looking

01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:50.040
like they fight crime for
the Los Angeles Rams.

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:51.166
Shut the fuck up about the suit.

01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:52.041
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:54.666
Watch your frown lines, angel baby.
I'm just trying to bond a little bit.

01:00:54.708 --> 01:00:56.250
Yeah, well then talk
about something else.

01:00:56.291 --> 01:00:56.791
Fine.

01:01:04.008 --> 01:01:04.508
Stop it.

01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:07.916
If they can fix your world.

01:01:07.916 --> 01:01:09.708
What's the first thing you're gonna
do when you get out of here?

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.708
Some rubbing-alcohol shots?
Maybe a wiper-fluid chaser?

01:01:12.958 --> 01:01:13.500
What did you say?

01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:14.916
So when you get back,

01:01:14.916 --> 01:01:16.625
...what's the first thing you're gonna do?
- No, no, no, before that.

01:01:18.416 --> 01:01:20.000
If they can fix your world?

01:01:24.166 --> 01:01:26.916
- What do you mean "if"?
- I mean--

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:27.541
You lied to me.

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.041
You don't have a fucking clue if
they can help me fix things, do you?

01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:32.250
No, I mean--
No, fuck!

01:01:33.375 --> 01:01:33.708
Fuck!

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:35.500
- I didn't lie.
- You lied.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.333
No, I made an educated wish.

01:01:39.375 --> 01:01:40.541
Because I need you.

01:01:41.833 --> 01:01:43.500
This, this is why.

01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:44.541
Right here.

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:47.000
Because if we don't
do something, they die.

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:49.250
I don't know anything
about saving worlds.

01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:51.041
And why would I even care?

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.333
Because my entire world is
right here in this picture.

01:01:54.916 --> 01:01:58.916
It's only nine people, and I have
no idea how to save it alone.

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:01.666
I know how to fuck
people up for money,

01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:04.000
but you, you, know
how to save them.

01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:06.500
At least the other Wolverine did.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:07.916
Oh, fuck!

01:02:08.208 --> 01:02:10.083
I guess I'm stuck
with the worst one.

01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:12.958
Did you say you made an

01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:15.875
educated fucking wish?

01:02:16.208 --> 01:02:18.083
They call me the
Merc with the Mouth.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.458
They don't call me Truthful Timmy,
the blowjob queen of Saskatoon.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:26.750
One more word.

01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:30.291
Please give me one.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:34.333
Gubernatorial.

01:02:38.125 --> 01:02:39.375
You know what?
You're a fucking joke.

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.916
No wonder the Avengers
didn't take you.

01:02:42.916 --> 01:02:44.750
Or the X-Men... and
they'll take fuckin' anyone!

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.166
I mean, you are a

01:02:47.166 --> 01:02:50.583
ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.

01:02:51.291 --> 01:02:53.208
I have never met

01:02:53.208 --> 01:02:55.625
a sadder, more
attention-starved,

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:58.500
jabbering little prick
in my entire life.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.416
And that says a lot,

01:02:59.416 --> 01:03:02.791
because I've been alive
for more than 200 fucking years.

01:03:03.166 --> 01:03:06.291
I'll tell ya, that bald chick
was right about one thing.

01:03:06.291 --> 01:03:08.458
You will never save the world.

01:03:08.916 --> 01:03:13.166
You couldn't even save a relationship
with a goddamn stripper.

01:03:13.666 --> 01:03:16.041
Motherfucker, I wish I could
say you'll die alone,

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:20.625
but it's one of God's best jokes that
you can't die, except that's on all of us.

01:03:25.083 --> 01:03:27.250
You got nothing to say, 'Mouth?

01:03:36.166 --> 01:03:37.500
I'm gonna fight you now.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:51.833
How are you?

01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:53.416
Not talkin' now, are you?

01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:01.333
You dirty bitch!

01:04:35.166 --> 01:04:35.625
No, no, no.

01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:02.166
I take it all back,
the Honda Odyssey fucks hard.

01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:04.166
Too bad you don't, needle dick.

01:05:04.458 --> 01:05:06.000
Oh, we're just getting started, bub.

01:06:04.041 --> 01:06:04.625
Thor!

01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:09.041
Where are we?

01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:12.458
No clue, but I like it here.

01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:14.125
Okay, look at you... all.

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:15.500
You must be the Others.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:17.041
Terrific.

01:07:17.875 --> 01:07:21.250
So just to refresh,
you are one--

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.708
- Elektra.
- Elektra, yes.

01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:23.291
Who could forget?

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:27.166
And you, I was not
expecting to see you here,

01:07:27.541 --> 01:07:29.791
thought you were...
you know, retired.

01:07:31.583 --> 01:07:32.183
Retarded?

01:07:33.833 --> 01:07:34.433
Retired.

01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:37.291
I'm already in the void.
I'm not trying to get canceled again.

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:38.708
- I don't like you.
- You never did.

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:44.125
And who's this succulent
reminder of my own inadequacies?

01:07:44.791 --> 01:07:48.208
Look at you. You look like the
superhero version of Hawkeye.

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:50.166
The name's Remy LeBeau.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.666
"Le Diable Blanc",
but you can call me the Gambit.

01:07:53.708 --> 01:07:56.250
It's been a while since I've seen
Sling Blade hit me again.

01:07:57.583 --> 01:07:58.666
They call me the Gambit.

01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:59.208
Do they?

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:02.291
Are you sure you didn't just really,
really want them to, but it never quite worked out?

01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:07.166
You know, we never had
a Wolverine up in here.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.041
But I can tell you now, it's just
a common courtesy to ask

01:08:11.541 --> 01:08:12.833
before you drink up all of my liquor.

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.875
It's a good thing
I don't give a fuck.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:23.500
So embarrassing.

01:08:25.958 --> 01:08:27.708
Well, now that that's settled,
look, we came a long

01:08:27.708 --> 01:08:28.708
way to find you three.

01:08:28.958 --> 01:08:30.250
- There's four of us.
- There's four?

01:08:30.666 --> 01:08:31.416
Wait, is it Magneto?

01:08:32.291 --> 01:08:34.750
Dear sweet God in
heaven, let it be Magneto,

01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:36.375
...because with him, - He's dead
- Fuck!

01:08:36.458 --> 01:08:37.791
Now Disney gets cheap?

01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:38.541
It's like Pinocchio

01:08:38.541 --> 01:08:41.250
jammed his face in my ass
and started lying like crazy.

01:08:44.666 --> 01:08:46.833
Not a single word...
what do you do exactly?

01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:48.500
Charge the playing cards.

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:49.791
Make them go boom.

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.041
Your power is close-up
magic, that's good.

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:53.625
We're not totally fucked at all.

01:08:54.041 --> 01:08:55.250
Who brought us here?

01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:56.458
That would be me.

01:09:06.958 --> 01:09:08.416
Don't make me regret it.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.541
Holy shit, Logan, that's her,
that's  X-23.

01:09:13.458 --> 01:09:14.625
She's the one I told you about.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.250
How did you all
get stuck in the void?

01:09:21.666 --> 01:09:22.708
There was a knock at the door,

01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:24.500
TVA sent me here.

01:09:24.541 --> 01:09:24.958
Me too.

01:09:25.208 --> 01:09:27.500
Maybe I was born here, so
it's hard to know for sure.

01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:30.041
TVA decided our universe was dying,

01:09:31.291 --> 01:09:32.891
and I never even got a
chance to fight for it.

01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:37.583
People like us don't go quietly.

01:09:38.333 --> 01:09:39.916
TVA knows that,
so they took us out.

01:09:40.958 --> 01:09:42.625
The answer is yes, I'm in.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:43.500
In what?

01:09:43.875 --> 01:09:44.475
A team.

01:09:44.958 --> 01:09:46.666
Me, you, you and me,
all of us together.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.375
Let's get the
fuck out of this place.

01:09:48.375 --> 01:09:51.500
- Don't listen to him. He's a fucking liar.
- It was an educated wish!

01:09:52.208 --> 01:09:53.083
Look!

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:56.708
We've been inside Cassandra's lair.

01:09:57.208 --> 01:09:59.625
The only way out of
the void is through her.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:00.916
She can get us home.

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:02.000
She told us.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.083
Wait a minute, you've been inside?
And you made it out alive?

01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:07.208
Bullshit.
Nobody's ever done that.

01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:08.583
- We did.
- Every time one of us...

01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:10.916
...has gone up
against her, they die.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:12.750
The Punisher,

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.250
the Quicksilver, the Daredevil.

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.541
- Daredevil, I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.600
Okay.

01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:21.833
Even that sweet baby angel,
Johnny Storm,

01:10:22.916 --> 01:10:25.500
he up and going missing
like, what, two days ago?

01:10:26.416 --> 01:10:27.916
Ah, that's so sad.

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:31.291
Whoever this Johnny feller is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

01:10:32.666 --> 01:10:35.083
Look, there's strength
in numbers, all right?

01:10:35.291 --> 01:10:38.083
Us, plus you guys, we can
put Cassandra over our knee

01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:39.625
and force her to
let us out of the void.

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:41.500
I know what it means
to feel self-doubt.

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.166
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

01:10:43.208 --> 01:10:45.083
Gnawing a your gut like
a coked up tape-worm.

01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:46.708
It's like you're holding
up a mirror to my soul.

01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:49.041
You guys may not have been
able to save your universes,

01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:53.333
but you can avenge them.
It's what Johnny would have wanted.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:56.083
Wait, you knew Johnny?

01:10:57.125 --> 01:10:57.958
Oh yeah.

01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:00.500
Dick head here,
talked him into a team-up.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.000
And Johnny came down with
a little case of "the deads".

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.375
No, no, no, no, we don't know that.

01:11:04.375 --> 01:11:05.416
It was just a flesh wound.

01:11:05.625 --> 01:11:06.666
He may have survived.

01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:08.000
If he survived that,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.125
...he is praying for death.
- Thank you, Dr. Wolverine.

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:11.750
Spill-it!

01:11:11.916 --> 01:11:14.500
What you do to Johnny, huh?
Talk, or I'm gonna start dealing.

01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:16.291
Okay, okay, hey, hey, hey.

01:11:16.791 --> 01:11:19.541
Okay, he ran his fat-ass
mouth about Cassandra,

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:21.875
and she zip-zapped his skin,

01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:25.958
leaving his organs to splash crudely onto the
ground, while the soil greedily drank his blood.

01:11:25.958 --> 01:11:28.125
It was horrible.
He was like a brother to me.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.500
Look, he died before he
could make a difference,

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:36.916
but maybe you couldn't save your world,
but Jesus Christ, you could save mine.

01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:38.958
I don't give a shit about your world,

01:11:38.958 --> 01:11:41.750
but if these two made
it out of there alive,

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:44.750
maybe together, we could
get back in and take her down.

01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:47.666
Where I come from...
We call that suicide, "chère".

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:50.708
If we can block her psychic
powers, we can get a leg up.

01:11:50.708 --> 01:11:51.250
I know it.

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:52.916
Now, I know Magneto's dead,

01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:57.000
but I venture a guess that his helmet
is lying around here somewhere.

01:11:57.041 --> 01:11:58.416
- Cassandra melted a helmet.
- Fuck!

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.000
- After did she killed him.
- Fuuuck!

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:01.416
She don't play.

01:12:01.416 --> 01:12:02.791
She knows that helmet
was the only way

01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:04.208
to protect anyone
from her powers.

01:12:04.583 --> 01:12:06.375
The only other helmet
that strong is Juggernaut's,

01:12:06.541 --> 01:12:07.958
but he works for Cassandra.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.875
- Juggernauts helmet, that's it.
- And we know that lid...

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:12.583
...ain't coming off without
'dat dong come off wid'it.

01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:14.541
I'm so sorry, beautiful,
I want this to be gentle.

01:12:14.541 --> 01:12:15.791
Who is your dialect coach?

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:16.708
The minions?

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.958
I feel like we're missing
critical exposition here.

01:12:21.625 --> 01:12:23.500
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

01:12:25.625 --> 01:12:27.208
Let's face it,
our worlds forgot about us.

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:29.458
Or never learned about us.

01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:30.541
The heroes we were.

01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:33.208
- Lives we saved.
- Or wanted to save.

01:12:33.875 --> 01:12:35.333
Maybe these two
are our chance,

01:12:37.083 --> 01:12:39.208
to be remembered
the way we deserve.

01:12:40.958 --> 01:12:41.291
Yes.

01:12:41.708 --> 01:12:42.408
An ending

01:12:43.191 --> 01:12:43.891
Legacy.

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:46.583
Yes, yes, let this man cook.

01:12:46.916 --> 01:12:48.000
This is what I'm talking about.

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:51.375
Big slow-motion fight, sad music,
everybody working together.

01:12:51.375 --> 01:12:53.000
Who knows if you live or die,
that sort of thing.

01:12:53.416 --> 01:12:53.875
Who's ready?

01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:54.958
I was born ready.

01:12:55.541 --> 01:12:56.583
Yes, Gambit?

01:12:56.625 --> 01:12:57.583
I ain't know my daddy,

01:12:57.583 --> 01:12:59.375
but I'm sure I shot out
of his dick ready.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.458
Jesus Christ, that is graphic.

01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:03.583
Yeah, he was laying dem buttery
nuts all up in my mamma

01:13:03.583 --> 01:13:05.500
and I shot out up there and
I said, "What's up, doc?"

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.791
Johnny must've loved you.

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:09.916
X-23, what's it gonna be?

01:13:10.458 --> 01:13:11.125
The name's Laura.

01:13:11.583 --> 01:13:12.750
Let's fucking go.

01:13:12.833 --> 01:13:14.458
Let's fucking go.

01:13:14.916 --> 01:13:16.000
So, let's kick it and go.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.166
Yeah, we're doing this.

01:13:17.166 --> 01:13:18.500
You're all fucking dead.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.083
My god, read the room.

01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:33.500
I'm not looking for company.

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:35.583
Get out of here.

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:39.875
You remind me of him...
Angry, drunk, mean.

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.958
- Sounds like a great guy.
- I wasn't finished.

01:13:44.291 --> 01:13:45.666
Showed up when it
mattered the most.

01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:49.458
Couldn't help it.

01:13:53.291 --> 01:13:56.375
You might not know it,
but you're a good man, Logan.

01:13:57.458 --> 01:14:01.541
You might not know it,
but apparently I'm the worst Logan.

01:14:03.916 --> 01:14:05.375
I got to have a life because of you.

01:14:08.666 --> 01:14:09.916
I got to grow up because of you.

01:14:12.416 --> 01:14:13.166
A lot of kids did.

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:15.958
A lot of kids didn't
grow up because of me.

01:14:18.125 --> 01:14:19.458
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:22.166
That suit says different.

01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:24.458
Yeah, you like it?

01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:30.583
Scott used to
beg me to wear it.

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:33.375
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:36.791
All of them.

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:39.750
Wanted me to be
part of the team.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.500
Told them they all
looked fucking ridiculous.

01:14:44.666 --> 01:14:49.250
I couldn't have them
thinking I wanted to be there.

01:14:54.833 --> 01:14:58.166
And then one day, while I was off
on my own, the humans came.

01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:00.166
And went mutant hunting.

01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:02.791
I can guess the rest.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.416
No, no, let me.

01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:06.291
Let me say it.

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:11.166
I need to say it.

01:15:13.291 --> 01:15:16.291
By the time I stumbled home
shit-faced from the bar, it was too late.

01:15:20.541 --> 01:15:21.708
They were dead, every...

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:32.208
This suit's all I got to
remind me of who they were.

01:15:33.508 --> 01:15:34.250
And what I did.

01:15:47.833 --> 01:15:49.083
We're headed to
Cassandra's at sun up.

01:15:50.416 --> 01:15:51.875
Have fun, not my fight.

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:57.500
We won't pull this off
without you.

01:16:04.208 --> 01:16:06.875
Hey, whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.300
You were always the wrong guy.

01:16:38.041 --> 01:16:38.250
What?

01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:40.000
Alioth didn't get them.

01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:43.166
Cassandra wanted to play
with them herself first.

01:16:43.541 --> 01:16:44.166
They got away.

01:16:44.416 --> 01:16:45.833
- Did they find the Others?
- No.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.708
- Good, all right.
- The Others found them.

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.500
Oh, very cute, well done, Pyro.

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:52.333
Classic bait-and-switch,
you really got me there.

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:52.750
Relax.

01:16:54.083 --> 01:16:56.208
If they come after Nova,
she'll handle it.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.416
Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.

01:16:58.625 --> 01:17:00.208
Why do you think we put
her there in the first place?

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.541
Thank God she's never
chosen to leave the void.

01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:05.500
The time-ripper is hours
away from completion.

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:06.833
I cannot take any chances.

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:08.875
Maybe not, but I can.

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:10.208
For a price.

01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:12.250
Why do you have to
say it, in that silly voice?

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:13.291
- It's so icky.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.458
- You want it done or not?

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.000
All right, your price.
Take her out.

01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:18.708
Mutants.

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:42.333
Look at that, yeah.

01:17:42.333 --> 01:17:43.666
See them big ole
hands come closing?

01:17:43.666 --> 01:17:45.291
I don' wan' to end up inside dat?

01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:46.583
What Gambit's trying to say is

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:49.458
getting Juggernaut's helmet
ain't gonna be easy.

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:52.083
I'm just making stuff up with this.
Yeah, tilt up to Blade.

01:17:57.833 --> 01:17:58.791
Where do you get
that little beauty?

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.250
That's Punisher's 18-4.

01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:02.333
Which Punisher?

01:18:02.625 --> 01:18:03.750
There's been like
five of them.

01:18:03.916 --> 01:18:05.000
There's only been one Blade.

01:18:05.875 --> 01:18:07.291
There's only ever
gonna be one Blade.

01:19:19.625 --> 01:19:21.125
Oh, this is gonna be good.

01:19:21.666 --> 01:19:23.625
You know how long I've
been waiting for this?

01:19:24.458 --> 01:19:26.416
Whoo, I'm about to make
a name for myself here.

01:19:26.791 --> 01:19:28.625
I don't think you guys
walk away from this.

01:19:28.625 --> 01:19:30.458
You just make sure people know
what happened here today.

01:19:30.875 --> 01:19:32.875
When you get out of here,
you have a drink for me, yeah?

01:19:33.208 --> 01:19:34.666
You just stay on our six,
get inside.

01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:36.583
We'll make sure you
get the package.

01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:38.833
And we'll get our ending.

01:21:22.083 --> 01:21:24.083
Some motherfucker's still
trying to ice skate up here.

01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:33.000
You two escaping
I could live with,

01:21:33.458 --> 01:21:35.750
but coming back, willingly.

01:21:37.916 --> 01:21:39.125
Boys are so silly.

01:21:39.625 --> 01:21:40.666
I just need to get home.

01:21:40.916 --> 01:21:42.916
Well, that's not on
the menu, I'm afraid.

01:21:43.458 --> 01:21:46.750
It's death or enslavement.
"à la carte", of course.

01:21:47.083 --> 01:21:47.583
Upsy daisy!

01:21:53.833 --> 01:21:56.583
Finally, it's nice to give
someone else a chance to talk.

01:21:56.875 --> 01:21:57.875
Not my strong suit.

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:17.500
Shouldn't have done dat.

01:22:37.916 --> 01:22:38.666
Adios, pendejo.

01:22:41.166 --> 01:22:43.166
You are an interesting one,
aren't you?

01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:47.041
I do feel like you get
lost behind all of this.

01:22:50.625 --> 01:22:52.791
Deadpools are a dime a
dozen here in the void.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.541
But you, what's
going on in here?

01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:13.125
Interesting.

01:23:14.958 --> 01:23:17.083
Not what I expected back here.

01:23:17.916 --> 01:23:18.583
Behind the anger.

01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:24.958
You're hiding... from them,

01:23:25.916 --> 01:23:27.916
from all the ones
you let down.

01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:31.666
So much pain.

01:23:34.625 --> 01:23:35.208
I walked away.

01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:39.500
They called after me
and I walked away.

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:41.625
I always do.

01:23:42.416 --> 01:23:42.958
I know.

01:23:45.458 --> 01:23:48.041
That's not all you did, is it?

01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:54.916
You found them,
the X-Men.

01:24:00.875 --> 01:24:01.500
Dead.

01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:08.125
What did you do?

01:24:11.083 --> 01:24:14.000
I started killing...
and I couldn't stop.

01:24:14.458 --> 01:24:15.333
I didn't want to stop.

01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:19.458
All those bad men.

01:24:23.666 --> 01:24:24.958
It's not just the bad ones.

01:24:26.875 --> 01:24:27.750
My little animal.

01:24:30.875 --> 01:24:33.416
I turned the whole
world against the X-Men.

01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:42.166
Just once...

01:24:43.458 --> 01:24:46.083
I want to be the man
that Charles thought I was.

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:53.875
Logan, in the void you
can be, what you are.

01:24:55.375 --> 01:24:57.333
I just want to be free.

01:24:58.625 --> 01:25:00.291
I can set you free.

01:25:11.291 --> 01:25:16.544
I can silence all those voices.

01:25:23.958 --> 01:25:24.958
I've got you.

01:25:26.958 --> 01:25:27.958
I've got you.

01:25:28.583 --> 01:25:29.483
No...

01:25:30.638 --> 01:25:31.808
I got you.

01:25:40.875 --> 01:25:41.775
Get... It... Off!

01:25:42.875 --> 01:25:45.750
You're gonna send us home or
I'm gonna twist your fucking head off.

01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:46.708
Why are you laughing?

01:25:47.458 --> 01:25:49.500
I can't send you unless you

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.041
get this thing off my head.

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:53.250
And as soon as you do that,

01:25:53.541 --> 01:25:56.000
I'm going to boil your
brains on an atomic level

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.125
whilst flicking my bean
to the Enya box set.

01:25:59.125 --> 01:26:00.458
There's an Enya box set?

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:03.000
Either you kill me or I kill you.

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:05.125
Both wonderful options.

01:26:05.958 --> 01:26:06.916
You want me to do it?

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:08.541
No, I'll do it.

01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:10.791
I have her neck right here,
it's really no problem.

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:11.458
You'll screw it up.

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:14.000
Oh come on, Mr. PG-13
except the last one.

01:26:15.041 --> 01:26:15.625
What the fuck?

01:26:17.458 --> 01:26:18.583
No, no, no.

01:26:18.583 --> 01:26:20.500
You have no idea what it's like.

01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:23.500
Day after day,
shovel the shit.

01:26:24.041 --> 01:26:25.000
Fetch the meats.

01:26:25.583 --> 01:26:27.416
I have spent my entire--

01:26:30.416 --> 01:26:31.541
Not everyone gets a speech.

01:26:33.958 --> 01:26:34.625
She's gonna die.

01:26:35.166 --> 01:26:36.500
Okay, hey, hey.
If Itake this helmet off,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.166
you promise you won't kill us.

01:26:38.708 --> 01:26:41.000
I promise I will kill you first.

01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:42.625
Why are you like this?

01:26:42.916 --> 01:26:43.833
I wish I knew.

01:26:44.458 --> 01:26:44.875
Take it off.

01:26:45.416 --> 01:26:46.208
- What?
- Take it off.

01:26:46.458 --> 01:26:47.333
- Why?
- Just take it off.

01:26:47.375 --> 01:26:49.083
This is our only
chance to fix our shit.

01:26:49.166 --> 01:26:49.625
Take it off!

01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:53.166
I am wearing a suit.

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.875
And that means a lot of things,

01:26:55.875 --> 01:26:59.166
but most of all,
it means I'm an X-Man.

01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:01.625
And I know your brother.

01:27:04.208 --> 01:27:05.958
As much as I wanna
fucking kill you,

01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:08.166
every bone in my body
wants to fucking kill you.

01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:11.416
He would not let me stand
here and watch you die.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:14.625
Take your hands off.

01:27:16.916 --> 01:27:17.541
This is for him.

01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:20.916
This is for Charles.

01:27:32.666 --> 01:27:34.208
Don't you dare
do me like Johnny.

01:27:40.958 --> 01:27:41.833
My brother loved you.

01:27:43.875 --> 01:27:44.666
He loved all of us?

01:27:46.666 --> 01:27:48.875
Hmm. Must be nice.

01:27:50.291 --> 01:27:51.166
He would have loved you too.

01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:55.375
If he knew about you,

01:27:57.333 --> 01:27:59.541
if he knew where you were,
he would have torn a

01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:02.000
hole in the fucking universe
to bring you home.

01:28:06.041 --> 01:28:06.750
This is home.

01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:09.541
At least let us save his.

01:28:14.083 --> 01:28:15.625
You wanna hear
something crazy?

01:28:17.958 --> 01:28:20.750
An amature magician rolled
through here a while back.

01:28:21.625 --> 01:28:22.916
I killed him, of course,

01:28:23.916 --> 01:28:25.916
wore his skin around
for four days.

01:28:27.291 --> 01:28:33.625
But I found this little trinket
on his lovely fingers.

01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:35.125
Strange...

01:28:38.375 --> 01:28:39.625
Marvel sparkle circle.

01:28:40.083 --> 01:28:42.625
- What is that?
- This is your way home.

01:28:43.125 --> 01:28:46.750
I do owe you for saving my life,
but let's keep things interesting.

01:28:47.166 --> 01:28:50.083
I'd say you have about four seconds
before you're Alioth's food.

01:28:54.975 --> 01:28:55.666
Race you.

01:30:19.416 --> 01:30:21.416
You got a standard three year

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.541
bumper-to-bumper warranty.

01:30:22.916 --> 01:30:24.250
Glad you gave us a second chance.

01:30:24.791 --> 01:30:26.416
And don't worry,
Wade and I are a team,

01:30:26.416 --> 01:30:27.500
so I'll see he gets
half the comi--

01:30:29.875 --> 01:30:32.708
That feels like a Kia

01:30:32.708 --> 01:30:34.708
It's that kid's car, wasn't it?

01:30:36.875 --> 01:30:39.166
Holy shit, that's Deadpool.

01:30:40.008 --> 01:30:40.750
That's Wolverine.

01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:41.875
You damn straight it is.

01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:44.083
Fox killed him.
Disney brought him back.

01:30:44.083 --> 01:30:45.833
They're gonna make him
do this till he's 90.

01:30:46.583 --> 01:30:47.000
Let's go.

01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:50.000
- I'll clock you out.
- Forever.

01:30:51.791 --> 01:30:52.041
Forever.

01:31:00.041 --> 01:31:00.875
Wakey wakey.

01:31:01.458 --> 01:31:01.708
God.

01:31:04.166 --> 01:31:06.541
Now you put all these
bullets in my belly

01:31:06.541 --> 01:31:08.916
and I'm gonna find out why.

01:31:09.625 --> 01:31:10.291
Whoa, whoa!

01:31:11.708 --> 01:31:12.500
I'll just say it!

01:31:13.416 --> 01:31:15.333
You don't have to
stick your fingers in me.

01:31:15.625 --> 01:31:17.416
Jesus, just ask sometimes.

01:31:18.333 --> 01:31:18.708
Fine.

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:20.833
Really?

01:31:22.083 --> 01:31:22.750
Hands in pockets.

01:31:24.958 --> 01:31:25.791
A guy named Paradox.

01:31:26.958 --> 01:31:28.000
He said he'd get me
out of the void.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:29.833
All I know is he
works for the TVA.

01:31:30.291 --> 01:31:32.458
The TVA?
We had an agreement.

01:31:32.708 --> 01:31:34.000
I don't think this guy cares.

01:31:34.666 --> 01:31:36.416
Huh, he will.

01:31:37.333 --> 01:31:40.375
Hey people, how much longer
before the time-ripper is active?

01:31:40.666 --> 01:31:42.083
We're running the
final safety checks.

01:31:42.791 --> 01:31:45.291
Oh, okay, all right, thanks for all
your hard work, Ralph, tip-top!

01:31:45.416 --> 01:31:46.000
Really?

01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:49.458
No, you drooling boob.
No, we have company,

01:31:49.708 --> 01:31:50.625
cancel the safety checks.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.166
We need to be live now.

01:31:52.625 --> 01:31:54.000
Oh, I hate you so much!

01:31:56.791 --> 01:31:58.833
No, stop, piss off,
you're too late.

01:31:58.966 --> 01:31:59.708
You're fucking done.

01:32:00.083 --> 01:32:02.583
- Why was Thor crying?
- How dare you?

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:04.208
No one comes back
from the void.

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:05.750
Tell that to Cassandra Nova.

01:32:14.875 --> 01:32:16.625
Paradox, we have a problem.

01:32:19.666 --> 01:32:20.666
Paradox?

01:32:23.291 --> 01:32:25.625
Well, you are dourier than
you looked in Pyro's head,

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:27.125
you tried to kill me.

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:28.458
I literally have no idea.

01:32:29.708 --> 01:32:32.625
You come for the king,
you better kill the king.

01:32:33.041 --> 01:32:36.291
Oh, welcome to the
skull fuck club, Paradox.

01:32:36.625 --> 01:32:38.666
You know she doesn't
wash that hand .

01:32:39.041 --> 01:32:41.041
Oh, what's this?

01:32:43.125 --> 01:32:45.333
A time-ripper?
Naughty boy.

01:32:45.375 --> 01:32:46.708
Oh no, we're on it,
we're gonna head down

01:32:46.708 --> 01:32:48.000
and dismantle that thing now.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.875
We got you, boo, you just
keep playing those keys.

01:32:50.458 --> 01:32:52.000
I don't want to destroy it.

01:32:52.625 --> 01:32:53.916
I want to use it.

01:32:54.541 --> 01:32:56.666
Now shoo, mommy and daddy
are having a conversation.

01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:04.875
You know, the funny thing is...

01:33:05.625 --> 01:33:06.875
I was happy in the void.

01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:10.958
You sent no trash to me,
Alioth and I cleaned it up.

01:33:11.375 --> 01:33:13.000
Everyone was happy.

01:33:14.083 --> 01:33:16.791
And you had to go and
piss on my side of the fence.

01:33:17.375 --> 01:33:19.125
And so now the fence
must come down.

01:33:20.416 --> 01:33:21.916
I'm going to use
your little time-ripper

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:24.083
and I'm going to
destroy this universe

01:33:25.125 --> 01:33:27.875
and the next and
the next and the next

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.416
until all that's left is the void.

01:33:31.708 --> 01:33:33.375
And I get to play God.

01:33:34.125 --> 01:33:34.583
Come on.

01:33:35.791 --> 01:33:37.125
Now, who are going to
show me how to use

01:33:37.125 --> 01:33:38.416
this fancy gadget of yours

01:33:38.625 --> 01:33:41.666
Don't worry, I've called some friends
to make sure we're not disturbed.

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.541
Sorry to bother, madam,
but there's something you need to see.

01:33:48.375 --> 01:33:50.791
We're getting indications of
an unsanctioned time-ripper

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.708
activating on Earth 10005.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.625
- Whose district is that?
- Paradox.

01:34:08.666 --> 01:34:10.958
Thank you so much
for your help, darling.

01:34:11.708 --> 01:34:13.583
God, good to get
out of that head.

01:34:13.916 --> 01:34:15.125
What a mess.

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:24.000
Stop.

01:34:24.666 --> 01:34:26.083
Let's give it a beat
for the extras to clear.

01:34:26.583 --> 01:34:27.541
Go, go, go, go.

01:34:27.916 --> 01:34:28.500
Oh my God.

01:34:33.791 --> 01:34:35.875
Oh my God.

01:34:46.833 --> 01:34:47.458
Come on, girl.

01:34:54.791 --> 01:34:56.041
Come on, girl.

01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:14.625
That's my girl, we don't have
to be apart ever, ever again.

01:35:15.083 --> 01:35:15.791
Never, ever again.

01:35:16.083 --> 01:35:16.791
- Sorry.
- Fuck!

01:35:18.208 --> 01:35:20.000
What's cafe gratitude doing here?

01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:21.166
Sorry about that.

01:35:21.458 --> 01:35:24.708
Tremble not, sweet Mary Puppins.
I'll handle him...

01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:26.541
Come here, girl.
Papa is here.

01:35:26.541 --> 01:35:28.791
Hey, do not insult
this animal's autonomy.

01:35:29.583 --> 01:35:31.375
She can decide who her papa is.

01:35:31.833 --> 01:35:32.833
What's it gonna be, girl, huh?

01:35:33.083 --> 01:35:35.500
Original recipe?
Or "Van Milder" here?

01:35:35.958 --> 01:35:36.625
Oh, it's funny.

01:35:37.208 --> 01:35:38.958
I can gently tap
the fourth wall too.

01:35:39.583 --> 01:35:40.000
The proposal.

01:35:42.583 --> 01:35:43.291
The fuck was that?

01:35:43.791 --> 01:35:45.125
Bitch, you think
that's what I do?

01:35:45.250 --> 01:35:46.000
Both of you, shut up.

01:35:47.375 --> 01:35:49.083
- You smell something?
- Yeah, you.

01:35:50.375 --> 01:35:51.491
A lot of you.

01:36:06.916 --> 01:36:08.625
I told you there were a lot
of Deadpools over there.

01:36:20.791 --> 01:36:21.666
That's bad.

01:36:43.916 --> 01:36:45.458
I take it they're not friendly.

01:36:45.708 --> 01:36:46.458
Goodness, no.

01:36:46.666 --> 01:36:47.666
Sorry about this, boys.

01:36:47.916 --> 01:36:48.375
Mission over.

01:36:48.416 --> 01:36:51.625
Cause of death, 100.
Kill thirsty Deadpools.

01:36:51.875 --> 01:36:53.625
They're dumb,
but they can fight.

01:36:54.083 --> 01:36:55.958
Not me though.
I'd love to get in the mix,

01:36:55.958 --> 01:36:58.791
but I have low bone density
and I have to keep my face safe.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:00.416
Hold please.

01:37:00.417 --> 01:37:01.083
Oh, God.

01:37:01.083 --> 01:37:01.708
All right, look.

01:37:02.916 --> 01:37:03.291
Guys!

01:37:05.166 --> 01:37:06.333
Deadpool Prime here.

01:37:07.125 --> 01:37:08.375
Our fight isn't with you.

01:37:08.375 --> 01:37:09.750
Hey, when I want your opinion,

01:37:10.083 --> 01:37:12.291
I'll take Wolverine's
dick out of your mouth.

01:37:12.333 --> 01:37:13.875
That's Kidpool,
she's the dirtiest.

01:37:14.125 --> 01:37:17.166
- Can we just be done?
- Ooh, we're just getting started.

01:37:17.208 --> 01:37:17.750
No, no, no, no, no.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.166
With the whole multiverse thing.

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:22.375
It's not great.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.791
It's just been miss
after miss after miss.

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:31.750
Wizard of Oz did the multiverse
first and they did it best.

01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:34.375
The gays knew it,
but we didn't listen.

01:37:35.083 --> 01:37:38.000
Let's just take the L and move on.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.291
I think it's been steadily
great since Endgame.

01:37:40.541 --> 01:37:43.583
What are you talking about?
The multiverse is over.

01:37:43.583 --> 01:37:46.000
Cassandy's gonna destroy
the fuck out of every timelime.

01:37:46.958 --> 01:37:48.291
Y'all can't do shit about it.

01:37:48.291 --> 01:37:48.958
Do you not get it?

01:37:49.208 --> 01:37:51.666
If we don't get down to the
subway, and stop her or we all die.

01:37:51.708 --> 01:37:53.750
Say the boss lady don't
want no disturbance.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.208
You wanna get down
to the subway?

01:37:55.541 --> 01:37:56.791
You gotta go through us!

01:37:56.875 --> 01:37:57.875
Uzi time, baby.

01:37:58.375 --> 01:37:59.125
Uzi time, baby.

01:37:59.375 --> 01:37:59.833
Look alive.

01:38:08.541 --> 01:38:10.458
I think I'm hit.

01:38:10.833 --> 01:38:12.458
No shit?!
You did that on purpose!

01:38:12.708 --> 01:38:13.875
I did no such thing!

01:38:14.208 --> 01:38:14.833
Listen to me, gorgeous.

01:38:15.375 --> 01:38:16.500
How long does it take
for you to regenerate?

01:38:17.208 --> 01:38:17.833
Regenerate?

01:38:23.625 --> 01:38:26.458
You really are God's
perfect idiot, aren't you?

01:38:26.458 --> 01:38:26.750
I'm okay.

01:38:27.083 --> 01:38:29.666
How dare you, you
insensitive son of a bitch.

01:38:29.958 --> 01:38:31.750
How was I supposed to
know he doesn't regenerate?

01:38:32.041 --> 01:38:33.083
I'm not a medicine woman.

01:38:33.708 --> 01:38:36.083
Look, a donut cart.
They're practically hospitals.

01:38:36.375 --> 01:38:38.250
- They sell portable triage units.
- They don't.

01:38:38.291 --> 01:38:40.000
- I'm gonna get you to safety.
- He's not.

01:38:40.083 --> 01:38:40.416
Deep breath.

01:38:49.541 --> 01:38:51.416
Hey, why are we stopping?

01:38:51.833 --> 01:38:54.250
Just catching my breath.
Are your legs on vacation?

01:38:54.791 --> 01:38:55.541
- You're dead weight.

01:38:56.083 --> 01:38:57.250
- Just because I'm paralyzed.

01:38:57.583 --> 01:38:59.500
We all have problems.
Listen to me.

01:39:00.041 --> 01:39:00.666
You're gonna live.

01:39:01.958 --> 01:39:02.708
Look at me, Nicepool.

01:39:07.333 --> 01:39:08.000
You're gonna live.

01:39:09.083 --> 01:39:09.708
Say it.

01:39:10.833 --> 01:39:11.583
I'm gonna live.

01:39:12.625 --> 01:39:13.375
Say it with me.

01:39:14.083 --> 01:39:14.916
You're gonna live.

01:39:14.966 --> 01:39:15.583
I'm gonna live.

01:39:16.708 --> 01:39:17.250
Ha ha.

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.958
Say it louder!

01:39:20.416 --> 01:39:21.333
I'm gonna live.

01:39:28.375 --> 01:39:31.375
Hold your fire.

01:39:33.708 --> 01:39:34.583
Sweet little puppy.

01:39:46.583 --> 01:39:48.000
I don't think he's
gonna make it.

01:39:48.833 --> 01:39:50.166
God, he loved his face.

01:39:50.958 --> 01:39:52.750
I could taste his final thought.

01:39:53.291 --> 01:39:54.250
He was so afraid.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:55.875
But he died a hero.

01:39:56.125 --> 01:39:58.083
He died from murder,
you dumb fuck.

01:39:58.083 --> 01:39:59.458
All I have to remember him by

01:40:00.958 --> 01:40:02.875
are these two gold-plated,

01:40:02.875 --> 01:40:04.541
50 caliber desert eagle
pistoleros.

01:40:04.958 --> 01:40:07.125
This is for him.
Are you ready?

01:40:08.166 --> 01:40:11.166
I get to kill 100 yous?
Fuck yeah, I'm ready.

01:40:12.583 --> 01:40:15.083
- You don't wanna see this, bub.
- That's a good girl.

01:40:52.208 --> 01:40:53.041
Holy shit.

01:40:53.791 --> 01:40:55.500
You saved the good
stuff for special occasions?

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:56.791
Killing mostly.

01:40:57.458 --> 01:40:59.750
What's the wind resistance
on those blowjob handles?

01:41:01.333 --> 01:41:03.791
Sorry, I'm just a catty bitch
when I'm jealous!

01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:06.833
All right, let's do this.
Maximum effort.

01:42:14.375 --> 01:42:15.000
Mother fucker!

01:42:16.208 --> 01:42:17.083
I wish I was deaf!

01:42:53.458 --> 01:42:56.375
Come on, I blew it.

01:42:56.791 --> 01:42:58.119
After all that, the only thing

01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.183
you're gonna remember is

01:42:59.184 --> 01:43:00.246
that god-awful dismount.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.208
What are you laughing at,
little fucker?

01:43:08.833 --> 01:43:09.125
Uh-oh.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.208
I guess these ones regenerate.

01:43:17.708 --> 01:43:19.875
Come on, we don't
have time for this!

01:43:20.375 --> 01:43:22.291
Deadpools, stand down!

01:43:33.083 --> 01:43:34.625
This Deadpool is with me.

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:35.541
Oh no.

01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:37.041
Holy shit.

01:43:37.208 --> 01:43:38.000
That's fucking Peter.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.375
Wait, you guys know Peter?

01:43:43.833 --> 01:43:45.833
Are you kidding me?
Every Deadpool has a Peter.

01:43:46.041 --> 01:43:49.625
Shit, Peter's a god damn legend
in every Deadpool's world.

01:43:49.958 --> 01:43:51.875
Peter-san, hay!

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:08.458
Enjoy my Peter!

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:37.458
Oh, now you're here.

01:44:37.458 --> 01:44:40.083
- Oh well, you're too late, it's all over.
- Not yet, it's not.

01:44:40.125 --> 01:44:41.500
No, no, no, no,
but we're very close.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.041
Homestretch, folks, promise.

01:44:43.458 --> 01:44:44.750
Quick, let's have the stakes.

01:44:45.041 --> 01:44:46.291
If she steals the
time-ripper's energy,

01:44:46.541 --> 01:44:49.041
she has the power to shred
the fabric of all the realities

01:44:49.041 --> 01:44:50.666
until there is nothing
left but the void.

01:44:51.041 --> 01:44:52.750
- How do we shut it down?
- I don't know.

01:44:54.779 --> 01:44:55.779
How about now?

01:44:56.208 --> 01:44:57.916
The mask is really
intimidating, huh?

01:44:57.916 --> 01:44:59.916
It's like Batman except
he can move his neck.

01:44:59.958 --> 01:45:01.916
Okay, look, look, look, look, look.

01:45:02.666 --> 01:45:05.041
The Ripper is fed from a
secure chamber below ground.

01:45:05.333 --> 01:45:08.375
It is powered by twin
matter and antimatter feeds

01:45:08.458 --> 01:45:09.625
converging inside the device.

01:45:09.625 --> 01:45:12.041
Now Cassandra Nova is
redirecting the Ripper's power

01:45:12.041 --> 01:45:14.416
to eliminate all timelines,
starting with this one.

01:45:14.625 --> 01:45:15.916
Theoretically, you could stop her

01:45:15.916 --> 01:45:17.833
by short circuiting the
feeds in the chamber below.

01:45:18.041 --> 01:45:20.625
One of you would create a
circuit between the two feeds,

01:45:20.625 --> 01:45:23.666
then the released power
would destroy the machine.

01:45:23.875 --> 01:45:25.583
- But, well--
- Come on, man!

01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:27.625
If you're not gonna
swallow, spit it out.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Whoever formed the
bridge would be annihilated.

01:45:31.375 --> 01:45:32.000
- I could live with that.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
- I could live with that too, actually...

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.708
...we survive anything.
We're like cockroaches.

01:45:35.208 --> 01:45:35.958
Not this time.

01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:38.458
This is matter and antimatter.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.875
They do not play nicely
with each other.

01:45:40.875 --> 01:45:43.541
When they mix in your
body, you will be atomized.

01:45:44.333 --> 01:45:46.125
Trust the laws of physics
if you don't trust me.

01:45:46.708 --> 01:45:48.125
Even if you lived long
enough to make the circuit,

01:45:48.541 --> 01:45:50.541
You will die down there.

01:46:16.291 --> 01:46:17.791
Hold up, hold up.

01:46:18.291 --> 01:46:19.500
You heard that asshole upstairs.

01:46:19.875 --> 01:46:23.416
Even if we pull this off,
we're dead, permanently.

01:46:24.458 --> 01:46:26.083
- That's why it's gotta be me.
- What?

01:46:30.375 --> 01:46:33.625
Look, man, you didn't
ask for any of this.

01:46:34.458 --> 01:46:35.041
You were right.

01:46:36.125 --> 01:46:36.583
I lied.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.166
I lied right to your face.

01:46:39.791 --> 01:46:41.500
Just to get you to help me, you did.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.291
You didn't lie.

01:46:45.541 --> 01:46:47.083
You made an educated wish.

01:46:50.666 --> 01:46:50.916
Come on.

01:46:52.833 --> 01:46:54.291
You got a whole
world to go back to.

01:46:56.208 --> 01:46:56.666
I got nothing.

01:46:59.166 --> 01:46:59.875
I got nothing.

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:05.916
Give me this.

01:47:13.175 --> 01:47:13.625
Hey.

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:21.291
I waited a long time
for this team-up.

01:47:23.083 --> 01:47:23.791
You know something?

01:47:26.291 --> 01:47:27.458
You're the best Wolverine.

01:47:36.666 --> 01:47:37.833
Say hi to your friends for me.

01:47:51.250 --> 01:47:52.541
Open the door.

01:47:52.541 --> 01:47:55.333
I can't hear you over
all the noble sacrifice.

01:47:55.625 --> 01:47:56.875
Why are you fucking doing this?

01:47:57.375 --> 01:47:59.708
Because I'm Marvel Jesus.

01:48:02.083 --> 01:48:02.583
Or Spock.

01:48:04.166 --> 01:48:04.958
Hard to say.

01:48:09.291 --> 01:48:09.875
Hey!

01:48:11.375 --> 01:48:12.291
You're fucking idiot!

01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:19.458
Sorry, I'm just stalling.

01:48:20.041 --> 01:48:21.791
I think I'm nervous about dying.

01:48:22.666 --> 01:48:23.458
This should be me.

01:48:24.625 --> 01:48:26.291
Say hi to my friends for me, Peanut.

01:48:26.666 --> 01:48:26.958
Wade?

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:28.916
You wanna be an annoying prick?

01:48:28.916 --> 01:48:29.666
You're just sorry.

01:48:29.875 --> 01:48:31.625
You're gonna die again, you dumb fuck!

01:48:38.833 --> 01:48:40.375
Hey, you don't need to do this.

01:48:40.875 --> 01:48:42.625
I'm not doing it because I need it.

01:48:43.916 --> 01:48:45.166
I'm doing it because they do.

01:48:56.541 --> 01:48:56.833
No!

01:49:14.208 --> 01:49:14.416
No!

01:49:27.375 --> 01:49:28.083
He's not gonna make it.

01:49:37.583 --> 01:49:38.000
It's over.

01:50:46.041 --> 01:50:49.708
The Wolverine is
a hero in my world.

01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:54.375
Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

01:50:56.333 --> 01:50:58.291
You were always
the wrong guy.

01:50:59.491 --> 01:51:00.291
Till you weren't.

01:51:03.233 --> 01:51:03.833
Wade.

01:51:06.958 --> 01:51:10.916
Wade, you can finally,
finally, matter.

01:51:27.125 --> 01:51:27.821
Vanessa.

01:51:30.822 --> 01:51:32.215
I wanna see Vanessa.

01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:41.208
For the first time in
my life, I'm proud...

01:51:41.908 --> 01:51:42.708
...to wear this suit.

01:51:43.833 --> 01:51:45.541
It means I'm an X-Men.

01:51:47.958 --> 01:51:49.833
I am The X-Man.

01:52:34.133 --> 01:52:34.833
Paradox!

01:52:37.708 --> 01:52:38.416
You've been busy.

01:52:39.250 --> 01:52:40.208
Well, somebody had to be.

01:52:40.208 --> 01:52:42.125
We had some strange
readings from this location.

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:43.708
You wouldn't know anything

01:52:43.708 --> 01:52:45.333
about an unsanctioned
time-ripper, would you?

01:52:46.375 --> 01:52:47.833
No, no, I wouldn't know anything

01:52:47.833 --> 01:52:49.375
about an unsanctioned time-ripper.

01:52:49.791 --> 01:52:51.083
Maybe you should
ask Cassandra Nova,

01:52:51.291 --> 01:52:54.375
because I was assured that
she was safely held in the void.

01:52:54.583 --> 01:52:57.041
But no, she was here
and she fondled my brain.

01:52:57.375 --> 01:52:59.333
- How did she let this happen?
- You weren't involved at all?

01:52:59.416 --> 01:53:01.458
In stopping her, yes, yes, I was.

01:53:02.083 --> 01:53:03.083
But not nearly enough.

01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:05.875
Not as much as the men who
went down there after her.

01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:09.041
My men, my friends...

01:53:11.041 --> 01:53:12.416
I warned them,
but they would be

01:53:12.416 --> 01:53:15.041
completely obliterated if they went,
but they went anyway, like...

01:53:17.041 --> 01:53:17.541
...like heroes.

01:53:19.958 --> 01:53:21.541
Because that's who they were.

01:53:24.375 --> 01:53:25.875
They just did what they had to do.

01:53:27.625 --> 01:53:29.083
With no concern for
their own safety.

01:53:32.791 --> 01:53:36.125
The fact that we are
all still standing here

01:53:36.125 --> 01:53:38.666
is a testament to their heroism.

01:53:42.541 --> 01:53:45.250
Anyway, there's nothing you nor
I can do to bring them back now.

01:53:46.875 --> 01:53:49.333
- He has risen, baby girl!
- Fuck!

01:54:09.416 --> 01:54:10.500
Found your new anchor-being.

01:54:10.708 --> 01:54:12.833
And we're doing just
fine you piece of shit.

01:54:14.916 --> 01:54:16.000
Fine indeed.

01:54:16.541 --> 01:54:20.208
All right, put your greasy
tits away, you preening slut.

01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:23.791
I don't understand.
How are you two still alive?

01:54:24.166 --> 01:54:26.083
You're right, one of us
would have been killed.

01:54:26.666 --> 01:54:29.166
But you put a Deadpool
and a Wolverine together,

01:54:29.583 --> 01:54:31.500
make them hold hands
while listening to Madonna?

01:54:32.166 --> 01:54:33.875
Indestructible motherfucker!

01:54:34.416 --> 01:54:36.500
Let's get this Deadpool
variant back to the void.

01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:37.666
Wait, hold on, what?

01:54:37.875 --> 01:54:39.416
Nope, actually,
this one's homegrown.

01:54:39.875 --> 01:54:41.208
Like me, he belongs here.

01:54:42.250 --> 01:54:42.833
And you are?

01:54:43.291 --> 01:54:45.375
Peterpool.
But you can call me Peter.

01:54:47.375 --> 01:54:48.208
And I hope that you do.

01:54:54.916 --> 01:54:56.458
What the fuck is
happening here?

01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:57.875
You are under judgment

01:54:58.291 --> 01:55:00.166
for operating an
unsanctioned time-ripper.

01:55:00.167 --> 01:55:00.583
Take him.

01:55:00.625 --> 01:55:02.916
I was just doing what you
don't have the guts to do.

01:55:03.333 --> 01:55:05.958
Get off, get off, your
filthy hands off me!

01:55:08.250 --> 01:55:09.500
I'm grateful, gentlemen.

01:55:10.791 --> 01:55:11.708
Let's hold the bows.

01:55:12.041 --> 01:55:14.625
You led an Omega level
mutant to this timeline.

01:55:14.625 --> 01:55:15.000
You're welcome.

01:55:15.625 --> 01:55:17.708
And you shouldn't even
be near this timeline.

01:55:17.958 --> 01:55:18.166
He's welcome.

01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:21.583
And you look
damn good in that suit.

01:55:21.958 --> 01:55:22.500
I'm so sorry.

01:55:27.541 --> 01:55:28.500
I wanna show you something.

01:55:30.125 --> 01:55:30.750
Something huge.

01:55:31.125 --> 01:55:33.041
That's what Scoutmaster
Kevin used to say.

01:55:34.708 --> 01:55:35.291
Do you see that?

01:55:36.416 --> 01:55:38.000
Your universe is regenerating.

01:55:39.083 --> 01:55:42.500
Whatever you did here,
you not only saved your world,

01:55:43.208 --> 01:55:45.291
you spared your timeline
from extinction.

01:55:47.583 --> 01:55:48.250
I'd rest up.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.125
I have a feeling your work
is only just getting started.

01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:52.708
Till you're 90.

01:55:53.625 --> 01:55:53.875
Wait!

01:55:55.541 --> 01:55:56.916
We couldn't have
made it out of the void

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.416
without some help
from some people

01:56:00.416 --> 01:56:02.666
that the world kinda forgot.

01:56:03.541 --> 01:56:05.541
Is there any way that
you could maybe find a way

01:56:06.083 --> 01:56:06.666
to bring them home?

01:56:08.833 --> 01:56:09.791
I'll see what I can do.

01:56:10.291 --> 01:56:14.083
And I promised my friend here
that the TVA could undo

01:56:14.083 --> 01:56:16.208
some pretty awful
shit in his timeline.

01:56:16.708 --> 01:56:17.583
What would you say to that?

01:56:18.125 --> 01:56:18.833
Change the past?

01:56:20.333 --> 01:56:21.375
He did help me
save the world.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.416
And his past made him
the man who did it.

01:56:25.541 --> 01:56:27.625
There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.

01:56:29.250 --> 01:56:31.583
Logan.

01:56:34.041 --> 01:56:35.125
- Shawarma?
- I could eat.

01:56:44.541 --> 01:56:47.083
You know the Avengers
discovered Shawarma.

01:56:48.241 --> 01:56:49.541
They'd be lucky to have you.

01:56:59.666 --> 01:57:00.583
Fuck off!

01:57:02.041 --> 01:57:03.125
Come here my little cuntchkin,

01:57:03.708 --> 01:57:06.250
Yes that's you, you're a survivor!

01:57:07.208 --> 01:57:09.583
All is right in the world.

01:57:11.291 --> 01:57:12.000
Yes it is.

01:57:13.916 --> 01:57:14.958
So what are you gonna do next?

01:57:16.833 --> 01:57:18.541
I'll figure it out.
I always do.

01:57:19.833 --> 01:57:20.291
Alright.

01:57:21.833 --> 01:57:22.875
I'll probably see you around?

01:57:27.866 --> 01:57:28.666
Probably not.

01:57:32.125 --> 01:57:33.125
See you, bub.

01:57:42.725 --> 01:57:43.425
Logan!

01:57:50.166 --> 01:57:52.083
Al, I'm back.

01:57:52.833 --> 01:57:55.333
About damn time, you holdin'?

01:57:55.333 --> 01:57:57.041
I'm all out of devil's dandruff

01:57:57.041 --> 01:57:59.208
and I'm shaking like
an angry vibrator.

01:57:59.291 --> 01:58:00.000
Thank you, Al.

01:58:00.416 --> 01:58:00.958
We have company.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.791
Althea, this is Logan.

01:58:05.375 --> 01:58:06.625
Nice to meet you, Logan.

01:58:06.833 --> 01:58:07.666
Nice to meet you too.

01:58:07.708 --> 01:58:11.000
And this little ancient,
anal shit-knot is Mary Puppins.

01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:13.125
Or as I like to call her, Dogpool.

01:58:13.666 --> 01:58:15.291
You wanna treat
yourself to a little stroke?

01:58:16.166 --> 01:58:17.708
Get the tongue.

01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:19.708
Oh my God, motherfucker!

01:58:20.375 --> 01:58:22.583
Right... it's like an
armadillo fucked a gremlin,

01:58:23.125 --> 01:58:27.666
angrily, in a bed of gonorrhea,
and didn't stop till the sun came up.

01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:30.875
Everyone wants to matter.

01:58:31.875 --> 01:58:34.208
Turns out that you don't need
to be Marvel Jesus to do it.

01:58:35.333 --> 01:58:37.291
You just need to open your
eyes and look around.

01:58:38.291 --> 01:58:41.208
And if you're lucky,
you'll find a few friends.

01:58:42.291 --> 01:58:45.833
Old friends and some
new ones too.

01:58:50.333 --> 01:58:52.375
Give me the fucking
dog, talk to the girl.

01:59:03.208 --> 01:59:03.833
Oh, hi.

01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:04.791
Hi.

01:59:07.541 --> 01:59:08.750
You've been busy.

01:59:12.041 --> 01:59:13.000
I did it for you.

01:59:15.166 --> 01:59:18.083
If you don't want me,
I did it for you.

01:59:27.258 --> 01:59:30.458
Turns out...
I am the world's saving type.

01:59:31.250 --> 01:59:33.166
Just look around this
table if you want proof.

01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:35.250
The best part?

01:59:36.250 --> 01:59:37.875
Sometimes the people we save...

01:59:38.791 --> 01:59:40.291
...well, they save us right back.

02:00:20.875 --> 02:00:22.500
{\an9}You are not the only one with gifts.

02:00:23.041 --> 02:00:23.916
{\an9}What is this place?

02:00:53.250 --> 02:00:53.875
{\an9}Nice suit!

02:00:54.333 --> 02:00:55.041
{\an9}Listen Stan Lee!

02:01:02.916 --> 02:01:05.416
{\an9}I really like the art

02:01:05.416 --> 02:01:06.416
{\an9}in the Deadpool comics.

02:01:06.708 --> 02:01:07.333
{\an9}You know, I just always

02:01:07.333 --> 02:01:08.666
{\an9}felt kind of a kinship to him.

02:01:09.166 --> 02:01:11.375
{\an9}I like to play that guy someday.

02:01:39.166 --> 02:01:41.416
{\an9}I was there for three weeks

02:01:41.416 --> 02:01:42.791
{\an9}before I shot a single thing.

02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:44.458
{\an9}For that first day of

02:01:44.458 --> 02:01:47.166
{\an9}shooting, I was so nervous, man.

02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:48.625
{\an9}Everyone was sort of

02:01:48.625 --> 02:01:49.541
{\an9}going, "Who's this guy?"

02:01:49.958 --> 02:01:51.208
{\an9}You know, there was a lot of that.

02:01:52.041 --> 02:01:53.000
{\an9}You know, he was going to deliver

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.208
{\an9}and you can feel all

02:01:54.208 --> 02:01:55.208
{\an9}that kind of pressure.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.416
{\an9}Always the suit's fault.

02:01:59.083 --> 02:02:00.375
{\an9}Never the actor.

02:02:08.833 --> 02:02:10.000
{\an9}- This is...
- ...the only way.

02:02:19.375 --> 02:02:21.000
{\an9}Oh, this is what it feels like.

02:02:24.166 --> 02:02:25.500
{\an9}And there's the lights.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:26.750
{\an9}Medical research.

02:02:27.875 --> 02:02:28.625
{\an9}Bye, video.

02:02:29.083 --> 02:02:29.291
{\an9}Bye.

02:06:43.458 --> 02:06:46.083
I'm tired of these
absolutely vile rumors

02:06:46.083 --> 02:06:47.166
that I got Johnny killed.

02:06:48.541 --> 02:06:49.208
Let's look at the tape.

02:06:50.625 --> 02:06:53.416
In the void, you're
either food for Alioth

02:06:54.125 --> 02:06:54.916
or you work for her.

02:06:58.416 --> 02:06:59.041
Go on, Johnny.

02:06:59.833 --> 02:07:01.000
And I'll tell you who her is.

02:07:01.541 --> 02:07:02.541
Cassandra Nova, a

02:07:02.541 --> 02:07:04.416
megalomaniacal
psychotic asshole.

02:07:04.791 --> 02:07:06.708
A finger-licking
dead-inside pixie slab

02:07:06.708 --> 02:07:08.583
at third rate dime
store nut-milk.

02:07:08.583 --> 02:07:10.208
- And I'll tell you what she can do.
- I'm listening.

02:07:10.250 --> 02:07:12.125
She can lick my goddamn
cinnamon ring clean

02:07:12.125 --> 02:07:13.833
and kick rocks all the
way to bald hell.

02:07:14.041 --> 02:07:16.250
In fact, I don't give a shit
if she removes all my skin

02:07:16.250 --> 02:07:18.166
and pops me like some
nightmarish blood balloon.

02:07:18.458 --> 02:07:20.250
If the last thing I do
with this, God forsaken,

02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:22.916
cum-gutter existence,
is light that fuck box on

02:07:22.916 --> 02:07:24.166
fire I still won't die happy.

02:07:24.416 --> 02:07:26.208
Holy shit, girl, you crazy!

02:07:26.458 --> 02:07:27.083
That's right, Wade.

02:07:27.333 --> 02:07:30.208
I won't be happy until I've urinated
on a freshly barbecued corpse

02:07:30.208 --> 02:07:34.000
and husk-fuck that charred remains
while gargling Juggernauts jugger-nuts.

02:07:34.041 --> 02:07:34.291
Wow.

02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:35.625
And you can quote me.

02:07:35.625 --> 02:07:35.916
Okay.

02:07:36.708 --> 02:07:37.958
Gotcha, fuck face.
