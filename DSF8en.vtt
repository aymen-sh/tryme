01:30.670 --> 01:33.090
Ionized nitric minerals...

01:33.900 --> 01:35.620
Nitric acid.

01:43.480 --> 01:49.030
I thought you'd be the 
next one to wake up, Stan.

01:56.570 --> 01:59.520
How much time has passed since then?

01:59.940 --> 02:02.890
It must have been at least 
a few thousand years.

02:03.430 --> 02:05.620
There are no buildings.

02:05.620 --> 02:09.290
For them to have worn all the way 
through rebar, the pH of concrete—

02:09.290 --> 02:10.860
Okay, got it.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.760
That's enough.

02:16.660 --> 02:20.270
Stan, all of our clothes have weathered away.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.640
You can't expect to find your smokes.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.750
Take the opportunity to stop inhaling toxic gas.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.830
So, what are we doing now?

02:35.480 --> 02:38.130
A man once said...

02:39.840 --> 02:41.970
"No matter the state of humanity,

02:42.330 --> 02:47.150
someone will always emerge intent on 
unearthing all of the workings of the world."

02:48.630 --> 02:50.300
So the race is on.

02:51.310 --> 02:54.310
It's quite the elegant battle, don't you think?

02:54.990 --> 03:01.350
Who will master science first and become 
the sole ruler of the stone world?

04:45.250 --> 04:46.470
What's this?

04:46.700 --> 04:48.240
Nitric acid.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.890
Though heavily diluted.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.240
Are you sure this is going to wake them up?

04:52.240 --> 04:53.680
Really?

04:53.970 --> 04:56.870
I told you a few thousand years ago. Remember?

04:57.500 --> 05:00.940
The sparrows probed using glass wool 
electrodes doused in nitric acid—

05:00.940 --> 05:02.790
Yeah, yeah, got it.

05:03.510 --> 05:09.820
Point is, we just need these guys to have 
followed their order to stay conscious.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.650
After those superheroes 
were told to stay awake,

05:20.650 --> 05:24.530
this is all the survivors we have?

05:25.160 --> 05:28.610
Or should I say "sleepvivors"?

05:29.010 --> 05:31.140
Some people seem to be earlier than others.

05:31.590 --> 05:34.780
We may see more of them wake up soon.

05:34.780 --> 05:40.730
The venue staff must have 
heard Stanley's orders.

05:40.730 --> 05:44.130
I think there's a chance they're still awake.

05:44.130 --> 05:48.530
Nah, I don't think the 
civvies would have made it.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.200
Ma'am!

06:08.270 --> 06:09.590
A ring?

06:10.700 --> 06:11.890
Would you look at that!

06:11.890 --> 06:13.860
It's barely holding shape.

06:13.860 --> 06:19.310
It was time-capsuled in that mystery 
mineral for thousands of years.

06:27.770 --> 06:30.320
It's platinum.

06:32.060 --> 06:33.520
Excellent.

06:33.970 --> 06:35.950
Very elegant indeed!

06:38.740 --> 06:41.740
Suppose a world champion martial artist

06:42.130 --> 06:46.530
were to be revived into this stone world.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.860
The world would be his.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.720
But with platinum in our hands,

06:54.030 --> 06:57.880
we can immediately start 
mass-producing nitric acid

06:57.880 --> 07:01.900
and make more gunpowder than 
we'd know what to do with.

07:03.150 --> 07:06.240
And first, we'll need people.

07:15.760 --> 07:22.540
Once we have adequate manpower, 
we'll next travel toward the Yellow Dent.

07:23.180 --> 07:28.550
We'll find the ideal place for growing 
corn and make our base there.

07:37.610 --> 07:42.630
We'll secure food, clothing, and shelter 
as we begin producing gunpowder.

07:43.670 --> 07:49.900
In the meantime, we'll work on refining 
metals and precision machining.

07:53.350 --> 07:56.480
We've finally completed the firearm.

08:07.410 --> 08:09.040
Very elegant.

08:09.040 --> 08:15.290
And now, we are the pinnacle of science 
and warfare in the stone world.

08:15.290 --> 08:16.240
Yeah.

08:25.890 --> 08:29.260
You've noticed the fruit of the devil, have you?

08:30.280 --> 08:33.450
Tobacco plants grow wild here.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.550
I suppose I'll help myself to some.

08:39.050 --> 08:40.500
As a bonus.

08:43.570 --> 08:45.410
<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>.

08:46.120 --> 08:52.900
Dry the leaves of this plant, 
chop it up, and wrap it in paper...

08:53.420 --> 08:55.700
and you've got a cigarette.

09:14.990 --> 09:17.700
No one will threaten us.

09:18.200 --> 09:23.750
With my scientific acumen and your skill 
with firearms, my old friend Stanley,

09:24.060 --> 09:30.450
we can become the monocrats to rule the world.

09:30.450 --> 09:32.310
That's within our reach.

09:33.110 --> 09:35.410
Isn't that right, Stanley?

09:39.940 --> 09:40.980
Yeah.

09:41.530 --> 09:42.820
It is.

09:52.720 --> 09:58.350
In sum, Xeno and you, master and disciple 
in science, awoke around the same time

09:58.350 --> 10:00.370
and made use of nitric acid:

10:01.360 --> 10:04.590
one for the science of giving life,

10:05.390 --> 10:10.920
and one for the science of taking it away.

10:17.570 --> 10:20.260
<i>What are they talking about?</i>

10:20.260 --> 10:25.920
<i>Is that decent-looking Senku guy 
over there acquainted with Xeno?</i>

10:30.540 --> 10:33.280
<i>I'll make a casual approach.</i>

10:33.280 --> 10:36.640
<i>That's right, I'm the cool-headed Luna.</i>

10:36.640 --> 10:38.240
Say what?!

10:38.740 --> 10:44.370
Our rocket-building teacher 
was the enemy science boss?!

10:44.370 --> 10:50.460
<i>There he is! On the deck! 
I've got you this time, Doctor Taiju!</i>

10:52.060 --> 10:55.630
<i>All I have to do is point at him.</i>

10:56.200 --> 11:00.690
<i>Then Stanley will plug him, and we win.</i>

11:02.300 --> 11:03.830
<i>Th-Th-That's right!</i>

11:03.830 --> 11:04.970
<i>Of course!</i>

11:05.350 --> 11:08.090
<i>That's what I've been 
working at this whole time.</i>

11:08.090 --> 11:11.730
<i>I'm Luna, the capable woman.</i>

11:22.450 --> 11:26.600
That's some stupidly useful 
information we got out of Luna.

11:27.150 --> 11:28.800
Doctor Xeno...

11:29.130 --> 11:34.670
If he's our enemy, the Medusa may 
end up being our secret weapon.

11:35.860 --> 11:39.110
Th-Th-That thing still works?!

11:39.110 --> 11:42.510
The battery's completely drained. You know that.

11:42.510 --> 11:43.930
What do you mean, then?

11:44.490 --> 11:48.940
Doctor Xeno knows all too well how 
powerful the weapons of science are.

11:48.940 --> 11:52.180
He's trying to take over 
the new world with them.

11:52.620 --> 11:56.730
There's no way he would turn a blind eye to 
the super science weapon that is the Medusa.

11:58.450 --> 12:00.000
I see now!

12:00.000 --> 12:03.140
The question isn't whether 
or not it can actually be used.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.220
It's precisely because the enemy 
is an overly capable science user

12:06.220 --> 12:10.770
that the weapon transforms into the perfect 
bluff of an unstoppable ultimate weapon.

12:10.770 --> 12:12.660
Yeah, that's the idea.

12:13.820 --> 12:19.350
So if I have this right, we're using the 
spent Medusa as a way to intimidate them?

12:19.350 --> 12:21.920
<i>Come on! Point! Now!</i>

12:21.920 --> 12:23.510
<i>At Doctor Taiju!</i>

12:23.960 --> 12:26.230
<i>All I'm doing is moving my finger.</i>

12:26.230 --> 12:28.320
<i>Right? Easy. All done.</i>

12:28.320 --> 12:31.360
<i>Be cold. Be collected!</i>

13:08.850 --> 13:12.640
Get her inside to treat her wounds!

13:29.160 --> 13:30.620
<i>I can't!</i>

13:35.660 --> 13:38.070
<i>Why can't I do it?!</i>

13:38.070 --> 13:41.990
<i>I'm a cool, capable woman!</i>

13:41.990 --> 13:44.590
<i>I need to at least pass on the information!</i>

13:47.270 --> 13:52.140
That Senku person might know Xeno!

13:54.010 --> 13:56.160
She's saying something.

13:58.050 --> 14:01.200
Senku!

14:01.630 --> 14:04.280
Senku?

14:10.760 --> 14:13.370
Senku?

14:13.370 --> 14:15.860
What's she talking about? I don't get it.

14:15.860 --> 14:19.130
But it's information that the 
miss risked her life to obtain!

14:19.130 --> 14:20.750
It must be important somehow!

14:20.750 --> 14:23.160
All right, report to Xeno!

14:26.340 --> 14:28.630
<i>White Castle, White Castle!</i>

14:28.630 --> 14:30.790
<i>Ghost 2 here.</i>

14:30.790 --> 14:33.810
<i>Transmitting information from the goddess.</i>

14:39.900 --> 14:40.740
What is that?

14:41.890 --> 14:42.690
Senku!

14:46.470 --> 14:47.420
What is it?

14:47.420 --> 14:51.460
<i>I was at the comms, about to send 
out our regular transmission,</i>

14:51.460 --> 14:54.120
<i>when it started making screeching noises.</i>

14:59.030 --> 15:00.550
It's scrambled.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.750
The transmission's gone through 
a proper cipher device.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.110
Encryption?

15:07.110 --> 15:08.830
You mean they're telling secrets?

15:08.830 --> 15:10.110
No fair!

15:10.110 --> 15:11.090
Is it Xeno?

15:11.090 --> 15:13.760
Can't we decrypt it?

15:13.760 --> 15:15.760
It isn't that easy.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.840
We'd need a spectrum analyzer.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.900
I don't know what that is, 
but you can't do it right away, then?

15:22.360 --> 15:23.450
<i>No...</i>

15:23.450 --> 15:25.860
<i>It isn't what they're saying that's important.</i>

15:26.820 --> 15:30.300
<i>The communication happened after 
I saw Luna doing something.</i>

15:31.220 --> 15:32.450
<i>Which means...</i>

15:34.610 --> 15:36.810
<i>The enemy is nearby!</i>

15:50.850 --> 15:52.200
All right.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.140
You're Doctor Taiju.

15:58.610 --> 15:59.930
Hold your fire, Stan!

16:04.970 --> 16:07.660
Doctor Taiju was a body double.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.440
The true enemy leader...

16:12.030 --> 16:14.150
The OP scientist...

16:16.230 --> 16:17.500
is Senku.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.190
Ishigami Senku.

16:23.830 --> 16:24.850
Well?

16:25.620 --> 16:29.300
Which one is the true target?

16:29.300 --> 16:31.130
Which is Doctor Senku?

16:34.030 --> 16:37.370
The one who first spoke in that transmission...

16:38.090 --> 16:39.840
<i>Do you hear me, </i>Perseus<i>?</i>

16:39.840 --> 16:42.240
<i>We just had a change of plans,
and we need to—</i>

16:42.240 --> 16:44.750
<i>You can stop right there.</i>

16:45.730 --> 16:48.470
<i>That quick scientific decision-making...</i>

16:51.680 --> 16:58.080
<i>And based on the countless exchanges we 
had about rocketry thousands of years ago...</i>

16:58.080 --> 17:00.170
<i>His personality, his tone...</i>

17:01.790 --> 17:03.970
I've recorded all of our transmissions.

17:05.530 --> 17:09.830
This is Senku's voice!

17:11.080 --> 17:14.840
I'm not gonna hear him from here.

17:14.840 --> 17:16.340
<i>I won't need you to.</i>

17:17.070 --> 17:19.620
I can calculate his height based on his voice.

17:22.580 --> 17:27.590
<i>We calculate the vocal tract length based 
on the domain of a smooth function.</i>

17:27.590 --> 17:34.530
<i>Applied to human height, we get 5'7" with 
an error margin of one to two inches.</i>

17:35.580 --> 17:38.530
<i>And though he may have grown</i>

17:38.530 --> 17:43.330
<i>since the first and last time I met him,
he wouldn't have shrunk.</i>

17:46.970 --> 17:48.330
<i>Which means...</i>

17:49.480 --> 17:52.530
<i>His height is between 5'7" and 5'8".</i>

17:52.530 --> 17:54.550
<i>Age nineteen. Male.</i>

17:55.690 --> 17:58.720
All right. Perfect.

18:00.460 --> 18:04.420
I can easily get his height 
by comparing him to Luna.

18:07.090 --> 18:08.090
One.

18:10.650 --> 18:11.440
Two.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.780
Three targets.

18:18.220 --> 18:19.320
Sniper!

18:19.320 --> 18:20.370
There's a sniper!

18:21.670 --> 18:22.660
Hide!

18:22.660 --> 18:24.250
Get behind something!

18:35.810 --> 18:36.970
<i>Did they catch me?!</i>

18:38.200 --> 18:40.850
<i>Idiot! Stop looking at me, Luna!</i>

18:40.850 --> 18:42.890
<i>They'll know where I am!</i>

18:44.330 --> 18:45.500
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

18:46.180 --> 18:47.290
<i>Look!</i>

18:48.610 --> 18:50.650
<i>The OP science leader...</i>

18:50.650 --> 18:53.830
<i>The smart one is one of those three.</i>

18:54.180 --> 18:57.850
<i>If the target is as clever as Xeno says,</i>

18:57.850 --> 19:03.030
<i>he'll no doubt notice where you're 
looking and turn to face me.</i>

19:03.620 --> 19:07.580
<i>He'll naturally smoke himself out.</i>

19:08.370 --> 19:11.480
<i>Heya, Ishigami Senku.</i>

19:20.050 --> 19:22.180
<i>Beyond my line of sight...</i>

19:26.110 --> 19:27.340
Senku-sama.

19:28.740 --> 19:29.800
<i>Oh?</i>

19:30.780 --> 19:33.910
<i>He's retreated to the 
optimal geometric position.</i>

19:34.230 --> 19:35.460
<i>Not bad.</i>

19:36.680 --> 19:40.780
<i>But that's exactly why I can see you.</i>

19:42.800 --> 19:47.150
Xeno, let me ask one more time, just in case.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.790
<i>You're sure, right?</i>

19:50.790 --> 19:52.200
<i>I'm going to kill him.</i>

19:52.200 --> 19:53.620
<i>There's no taking it back.</i>

20:03.300 --> 20:06.260
<i>I use my science to take over the world.</i>

20:07.260 --> 20:12.770
<i>Or, if we join forces, 
we can be more certain of it.</i>

20:14.220 --> 20:19.950
<i>But a future in which he accepts 
such an offer would never come.</i>

20:38.800 --> 20:39.900
Yeah.

20:40.700 --> 20:41.960
Go ahead.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.790
<i>Starch...</i>

20:56.180 --> 20:59.650
<i>Or the powdered arrowroot from 
the soft serve we made earlier?</i>

20:59.650 --> 21:01.680
<i>Same shit.</i>

21:01.680 --> 21:02.680
<i>Water!</i>

21:33.240 --> 21:35.350
<i>Dilatant materials.</i>

21:35.350 --> 21:44.570
<i>Powder particles, mixed with a fluid, move 
the same as a fluid when disturbed slowly.</i>

21:45.600 --> 21:49.400
<i>But with abrupt impact, 
they suddenly turn solid.</i>

21:49.740 --> 21:55.630
<i>There's even been research on using that 
property to make bulletproof vests.</i>

21:57.460 --> 22:00.050
<i>Although it hadn't hit the market yet!</i>
