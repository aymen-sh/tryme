WEBVTT

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.115
Fuck!

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:05.657
It's me!

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:10.361
Anyone?!

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.562
Oh. Oh shit.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.501
Hi.

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:33.379
Hey.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.023
Yeah, you tell 'em.

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:54.933
You fuckin' tell 'em, Ellie.

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.035
Okay.

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:09.165
Hi.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.335
Oh, you're so tough.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.381
I got you. It's okay.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.068
Yeah, it's okay.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.116
Anna?

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.415
♪ Hold me ♪

00:06:57.416 --> 00:07:01.045
♪ Close to your heart ♪

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.422
♪ Touch me ♪

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.053
♪ Give all your love to me ♪

00:07:24.834 --> 00:07:25.995
Oh God.

00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:30.207
It's not your fault.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.033
We were delayed
getting out of the zone.

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:34.203
- I'm...
- She's hungry.

00:07:36.163 --> 00:07:37.991
She needs to be fed, and I...

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.219
I didn't wanna nurse her.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.887
I cut it before I was bit.

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:54.933
Before.

00:07:57.434 --> 00:08:02.105
I want you to... take her
with you to Boston...

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:03.732
find someone to bring her up,

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.525
and make sure that she's safe.

00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:08.654
- I can't do that.
- And I want you to give her this.

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:12.242
Anna.

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:15.411
Her name is Ellie.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.215
I can't.

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:22.419
How long have we
known each other?

00:08:29.791 --> 00:08:30.826
Our whole lives.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:36.599
So you pick her up right now...

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.519
and then you kill me.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:10.632
I can't kill you.

00:09:11.733 --> 00:09:13.843
Please, please, please.

00:09:14.944 --> 00:09:15.972
Please!

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.353
Marlene!

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.082
Here.

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:30.194
Hold her head... There you go.

00:09:31.761 --> 00:09:33.155
Take this.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.001
Cover her ears.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.258
Ellie.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:36.844
Ellie.

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:41.057
Ellie!

00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:44.309
D'ya hear me?

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.561
No... What?

00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:48.397
Well, I found this in there.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.849
Beefaroni. Chef Boyardee.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.568
Oh, cool.

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:58.790
And have you ever played this?

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:00.951
Boggle? It's a word game.

00:11:04.121 --> 00:11:06.632
Well, if you wanna beat me at
somethin', it would be this.

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.463
Well, all right then.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.181
We're gettin' close.

00:11:15.482 --> 00:11:16.741
Hospital that way.

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:18.627
May be the one
we're lookin' for.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.204
Got it.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:38.781
Take this for me?

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:44.395
Thanks.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:54.362
They had a guitar in that RV.

00:11:55.863 --> 00:11:58.341
It was all smashed up
but got me thinkin',

00:11:58.342 --> 00:11:59.843
maybe I should find one.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.695
I haven't played in forever.

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:04.973
In fact, I was thinkin'
maybe I could teach you.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:06.893
I bet you'd be great at it.

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.896
Do you wanna learn
how to play guitar?

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.927
Ellie?

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:18.364
Oh, yeah.

00:12:22.157 --> 00:12:23.242
That'd be great.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:51.811
Okay, so this is
what I'm thinking...

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:53.688
Cut through that building
to get around that stuff,

00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:55.584
find the skyscraper,
go up and look around.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.987
Uhh, actually, this time
I was thinkin' we blast

00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:02.155
our way through that rubble.

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:04.616
I found some dynamite
in that RV back there.

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:05.867
Really?

00:13:06.668 --> 00:13:07.744
No, so we're gonna cut
through that building,

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:10.532
find a skyscraper,
go up and look around.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.001
But I had you goin', didn't I?

00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:33.437
Look at this place.

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.231
Talk about bad luck.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.066
Military drops bombs...

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:42.905
not one of them hits the building
you're trying to demolish.

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.661
No way up.

00:14:08.888 --> 00:14:11.391
I get you up there,
you can drop that ladder down,

00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:13.052
maybe we go through that way.

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:16.093
Come on. I'll give you a boost.

00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:33.955
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.916
It's just you kinda seem
extra quiet today, so.

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.626
Oh... I'm sorry.

00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:40.296
No, it's fine.

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:43.548
- Did you hear what I...
- Yeah, boost.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.677
Got it.

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:59.148
One... two, up.

00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:05.862
- Ya got it?
- Yeah.

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:07.239
Okay.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.084
Whoa!

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:22.504
God damn it, Ellie!

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:24.097
Shit.

00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:25.817
You stay there!

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:28.685
You gotta see this!

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:30.386
Ellie?!

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:32.348
Up here!

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.010
- Ellie!
- C'mon!

00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:43.608
- Ellie.
- C'mon!

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:46.445
Just wait. God damn it.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.599
- Don't scare it.
- I won't.

00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:22.773
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

00:16:23.607 --> 00:16:24.983
Come here, hurry up. Come on.

00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:44.128
Hey there.

00:16:58.558 --> 00:17:01.645
So fucking cool.

00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:06.883
Aw, where's she going?

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:08.886
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:13.866
Okay.

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:50.468
So...

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:53.280
is it everything ya hoped for?

00:17:54.531 --> 00:17:55.865
It's got its ups and downs...

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:58.418
but you can't deny that view.

00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:10.515
Look, I don't know exactly
where this hospital is...

00:18:10.546 --> 00:18:11.547
Yeah, we'll find it.

00:18:12.548 --> 00:18:14.718
Sure. It's just...

00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:19.847
Maybe there's nothin'
bad out there, but so far

00:18:19.848 --> 00:18:21.892
there's always been
somethin' bad out there.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.687
- We're still here, though.
- I know.

00:18:26.688 --> 00:18:28.190
I'm only saying there's risk.

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:32.502
We don't have to do this.

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.695
I just... I want you
to know that.

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:36.614
What do you mean? What else
are we supposed to do?

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:38.199
Nothin'. We just
go back to Tommy's.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.494
We forget about
the whole damn thing.

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:45.124
After all we've been through...

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:48.210
everything I've done...

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.676
it can't be for nothing.

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.390
I know you mean well.

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:05.352
I know you wanna
protect me. You have.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.238
And when we're done,
we'll go wherever you want.

00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:12.433
Tommy's, sheep ranch,

00:19:12.734 --> 00:19:13.934
the moon.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.158
I'll follow you anywhere you go.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.710
But there's no
halfway with this.

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:32.412
We finish what we started.

00:20:34.841 --> 00:20:36.969
- Was this a FEDRA thing?
- No.

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:40.154
Army.

00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:42.423
They put these
places up all around

00:20:42.824 --> 00:20:44.409
the first few days
after the outbreak.

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:47.095
Emergency medical camps.

00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:49.931
Obviously didn't last.

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:53.368
- They had me in one just like this.
- With Sarah?

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:56.171
- No, she was gone already.
- Oh.

00:20:57.965 --> 00:20:59.415
So what was wrong with you?

00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:02.560
- It was for this.
- Ah, the guy who shot and missed.

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:04.912
I figured that would've
happened later.

00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:06.014
No.

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:09.642
- Second day.
- Well, I've gotta hand it to the Army people.

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:11.552
They were way better at
stitchin' you up than I was.

00:21:11.576 --> 00:21:12.576
It was me.

00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:18.385
I was the guy
who shot and missed.

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:33.726
There's no story.

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.127
Sarah died...

00:21:37.128 --> 00:21:38.713
and I couldn't see
the point anymore.

00:21:39.714 --> 00:21:40.740
Simple as that.

00:21:44.301 --> 00:21:46.722
And I wasn't scared either.
I was ready.

00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:52.060
I couldn't have been more ready.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.815
When I...

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.503
When I...

00:22:02.904 --> 00:22:05.490
went to pull the
trigger, I-I flinched.

00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:09.244
Still don't know why.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.852
Anyway, the reason I'm
telling you all this...

00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:16.558
I know why you're
tellin' me all this.

00:22:18.836 --> 00:22:20.405
Yeah, I reckon you do.

00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:28.305
So time heals all wounds, I guess.

00:22:32.016 --> 00:22:33.894
It wasn't time that did it.

00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:48.700
Well, I'm glad that...

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:52.454
that didn't work out.

00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:56.208
Me, too.

00:23:03.547 --> 00:23:05.993
- We should probably get going.
- Yeah.

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:15.443
You know what I'm
in the mood for?

00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:16.928
What?

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:19.439
- Shitty puns.
- Oh-ho-ho.

00:23:26.537 --> 00:23:29.833
"People are making apocalypse
jokes like there's no tomorrow."

00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:32.368
- Too soon?
- No, it's topical.

00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:34.328
Oh, I love this one.

00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:37.998
"Moon rocks taste better
than Earth rocks. Why?"

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:40.334
- "'Cause they're meteor."
- Oh, that's terrible.

00:23:40.335 --> 00:23:41.877
- Fuck you. That was actually good.
- That's a... That...

00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:44.013
- That's a zero outta 10.
- All right, all right.

00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:47.259
"What did the green grape
say to the purple grape?"

00:23:48.301 --> 00:23:49.436
"Breathe, you idiot."

00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:52.346
That was a three outta 10.

00:23:52.347 --> 00:23:54.223
- Seven, minimum. Uh-uh.
- I'll give it a five.

00:23:54.224 --> 00:23:56.184
- Five outta 10.
- Five?

00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.904
- Joel!
- Ellie.

00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:10.407
- Ellie!
- Joel!

00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:44.891
Welcome to the Fireflies.

00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:46.267
Easy.

00:24:47.268 --> 00:24:48.478
Ya got hit pretty hard.

00:24:50.213 --> 00:24:51.873
Patrol didn't know who you were.

00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:56.669
- Where's Ellie?
- She wasn't hurt.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.379
Not even a scratch.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.624
She's mostly worried about you.

00:25:02.626 --> 00:25:03.776
Where is she?

00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:06.378
We lost half our crew
crossing the country.

00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:09.256
I had five men whose only
job was to protect me.

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:11.550
And I still almost got killed.

00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:13.220
How'd you do it?

00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:16.222
It was all her.

00:25:16.223 --> 00:25:17.723
She fought like
hell to get here.

00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:19.935
She would've been
dead on day one.

00:25:22.229 --> 00:25:24.481
You are the one person I never
wanted to be in debt to.

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:27.858
But I owe you.

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:29.653
- We all owe you.
- Just take me to her.

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:32.063
I can't.

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:34.157
She's being prepped for surgery.

00:25:37.327 --> 00:25:38.620
What surgery?

00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:41.990
Our doctor...

00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:45.000
he thinks that the Cordyceps
in Ellie has grown

00:25:45.001 --> 00:25:46.961
- with her since birth.
- Why is she in surgery?

00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:49.230
It produces a kind of
chemical messenger.

00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:53.468
It makes normal Cordyceps think that
she's Cordyceps. It's why she's immune.

00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:55.678
He's gonna remove it from her,

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:57.513
multiply the cells in a lab,

00:25:57.514 --> 00:25:59.849
produce those
chemical messengers...

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.552
and then we can
give it to everyone.

00:26:04.228 --> 00:26:05.813
He thinks it could
be a cure, Joel.

00:26:06.814 --> 00:26:07.899
A cure.

00:26:13.897 --> 00:26:15.790
Cordyceps grows
inside the brain.

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:20.996
It does.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:28.069
- Find someone else.
- There is no one else.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.672
We didn't tell her, we
didn't cause her any fear,

00:26:30.697 --> 00:26:32.506
- there won't be any pain.
- No. No, you take me to her.

00:26:32.507 --> 00:26:34.134
You take me to her right now!

00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:45.228
Please... you don't understand.

00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:49.657
I do.

00:26:51.358 --> 00:26:53.861
I was there when
she was born, Joel.

00:26:53.862 --> 00:26:56.322
I promised her mother
that I would save her child.

00:26:56.323 --> 00:26:57.791
I promised.

00:26:59.242 --> 00:27:01.552
So I do understand.

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:04.256
I'm the only one
who understands.

00:27:10.127 --> 00:27:11.171
I'm sorry.

00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:14.924
I have no other choice.

00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:19.264
I do.

00:27:29.189 --> 00:27:31.509
Walk him out to the highway,
leave him there with his pack.

00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:33.787
Give him this.

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:38.899
He tries anything...

00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:40.911
shoot him.

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:24.661
I didn't hear
anyone say, "Stop."

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.287
Which way?

00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:28.665
Down the stairs.

00:28:54.816 --> 00:28:56.651
The fuck are you doin'?
Keep walking.

00:28:57.652 --> 00:28:58.905
I said keep walk...

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.910
- Fuck!
- Where is she?

00:29:07.537 --> 00:29:08.829
Fuck you.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:09.910
I don't have time for this.

00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:13.751
Shots fired. Shots fired!

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:05.499
Do we have enough power?

00:32:10.344 --> 00:32:11.345
She's ready.

00:32:15.391 --> 00:32:17.517
Unhook her.

00:32:17.518 --> 00:32:20.896
- How did you get in here?
- I said unhook her.

00:32:20.897 --> 00:32:22.690
I won't let you take her.

00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:25.817
Unhook her.

00:32:25.818 --> 00:32:28.529
- Move!
- Oh, my God.

00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:33.867
Cover her arm.

00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:35.787
- Fast.
- Okay.

00:32:39.707 --> 00:32:42.752
Turn around.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.579
You can't keep her safe forever.

00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:55.907
No matter how hard you try,

00:33:56.708 --> 00:33:58.368
no matter how many
people you kill,

00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:00.328
she's gonna grow up, Joel.

00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:02.831
And then you'll die.
She'll leave.

00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:04.040
Then what?

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:06.209
How long till she's
torn apart by Infected

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.794
or murdered by raiders?

00:34:07.795 --> 00:34:10.985
Because she lives in a broken
world that you could have saved.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:12.348
Maybe.

00:34:13.049 --> 00:34:15.094
- But it isn't for you to decide.
- Or you.

00:34:18.514 --> 00:34:20.433
So what would she decide, huh?

00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.603
'Cause I think she'd
wanna do what's right.

00:34:28.357 --> 00:34:30.151
And you know it.

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:35.572
It's not too late.

00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:36.873
Even now...

00:34:37.074 --> 00:34:38.743
even after what you've done.

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:41.913
We can still find a way.

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:25.540
- What?
- It's all right. You're with me.

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:27.750
Take it slow.

00:35:28.751 --> 00:35:30.051
The drugs are still wearin' off.

00:35:30.752 --> 00:35:33.456
I was with the Fireflies
and then...

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:36.511
What drugs?

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.972
They were runnin'
some tests on you...

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:43.266
and some others.

00:35:46.894 --> 00:35:48.896
Turns out there's
a whole lot more like you...

00:35:49.897 --> 00:35:51.315
people that are immune.

00:35:52.483 --> 00:35:53.860
Dozens of 'em.

00:35:56.904 --> 00:35:59.607
And the doctors, they
couldn't make any of it work.

00:36:02.201 --> 00:36:03.201
They've actually...

00:36:07.123 --> 00:36:09.292
They've stopped
lookin' for a cure.

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:16.966
Where are my clothes?

00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:21.554
Raiders attacked the hospital.
I barely got ya outta there.

00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:24.348
We'll find you some
new ones on the way.

00:36:27.642 --> 00:36:29.270
Were people hurt?

00:36:33.774 --> 00:36:34.819
Yes.

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:41.574
Is Marlene okay?

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.125
I'm takin' us home.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.313
I'm sorry.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.214
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

00:37:40.715 --> 00:37:41.884
Please.

00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:44.220
Let me go.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.556
You'd just come after her.

00:38:34.854 --> 00:38:36.856
Well, she got us close enough.

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.905
We gotta walk
the rest of the way.

00:38:45.906 --> 00:38:47.283
Probably about
a five-hour hike...

00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:50.044
but we can manage that.

00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:52.347
Remember?

00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:54.832
Yeah.

00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:06.586
You know, Sarah and I used to
hike like this all the time.

00:39:10.264 --> 00:39:11.723
I wouldn't say it was
her favorite thing.

00:39:11.724 --> 00:39:14.142
She wasn't a fan of the
mosquitoes and such.

00:39:15.143 --> 00:39:18.972
But she was a big climber...
or scampering.

00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:21.733
That's probably the right word.

00:39:21.734 --> 00:39:22.859
That girl...

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.694
she'd see a big rock,

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:26.197
and just... pew.

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:29.949
She woulda liked you.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.736
Not to say the two
of you are the same.

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:36.456
- Definitely different kids.
- How so?

00:39:37.457 --> 00:39:40.585
Well, she was a lot more...
I wanna say girly,

00:39:40.586 --> 00:39:42.897
- and I'm not sayin' that you're not girly.
- I'm not.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:45.875
Yeah, you're not.

00:39:47.884 --> 00:39:49.095
So that.

00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:51.764
She was taller.

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:54.633
She had a killer smile.

00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:57.211
Again, not sayin'
that you don't.

00:39:57.812 --> 00:39:59.471
But you know why
I think she'd like you?

00:40:00.172 --> 00:40:01.231
Why?

00:40:01.832 --> 00:40:02.942
'Cause you're funny.

00:40:05.277 --> 00:40:06.677
I think you would've
made her laugh.

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:12.882
Anyway, I bet you
would've liked her back.

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.654
Yeah, bet I would've.

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.432
There ya go.

00:40:40.019 --> 00:40:41.356
Not much further now.

00:40:42.815 --> 00:40:44.150
Hey, wait.

00:40:47.944 --> 00:40:48.980
Fuck.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:58.872
Back in Kansas City,
you asked me about

00:40:58.873 --> 00:41:01.041
the first time I killed someone.

00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:10.049
When I got bit in the mall,
I-I wasn't on my own.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:11.259
My best friend was there

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.370
and she got bit, too.

00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:16.055
We didn't know what
to do, and she says,

00:41:16.056 --> 00:41:19.726
"We can just wait it out..."

00:41:19.727 --> 00:41:21.647
"be all poetic and just
lose our minds together."

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:26.232
And then she did.

00:41:26.233 --> 00:41:27.651
And I had to...

00:41:31.154 --> 00:41:32.472
Her name was Riley...

00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:34.574
and she was the first to die.

00:41:35.075 --> 00:41:36.367
And then it was Tess.

00:41:36.368 --> 00:41:37.994
- And then Sam.
- That's not on you.

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:39.245
- I know, but...
- Look, sometimes things

00:41:39.246 --> 00:41:41.131
don't work out the way we hope.

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:42.833
You can feel like...

00:41:43.792 --> 00:41:45.594
like you've come to an end...

00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:47.655
and you don't know
what to do next.

00:41:50.507 --> 00:41:51.967
But if you just keep goin'...

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:56.471
you find something
new to fight for.

00:41:56.772 --> 00:41:58.532
- And maybe that's not what...
- Swear to me.

00:42:01.477 --> 00:42:04.964
Swear to me that everything you
said about the Fireflies is true.

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:10.738
I swear.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.255
Okay.
