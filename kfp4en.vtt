WEBVTT

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:29.445
Hey.
Hey.

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:33.532
Hey.
Hey.

00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:37.369
Hey.
Hey.

00:01:57.014 --> 00:01:58.182
Hmm?

00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:04.647
That's right. It is I, Tai Lung.

00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:05.940
It can't be.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.108
Tai Lung.

00:02:08.108 --> 00:02:10.861
I have returned to take what is mine.

00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:14.156
Which is everything that is yours.

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:27.628
Let it be known from the highest mountain
to the lowest valley that Tai Lung lives,

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:30.798
and no one will stand in his way.

00:02:30.798 --> 00:02:34.802
Not even the great Dragon Warrior.

00:02:43.852 --> 00:02:45.771
Oh, where is Po?

00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:48.524
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:51.527
Ping, will you please just relax?

00:02:51.527 --> 00:02:53.487
I am relaxed!

00:02:53.487 --> 00:02:56.198
Okay. I'm sure Po is fine.

00:02:56.198 --> 00:02:58.784
But what if he's sick? What if he's hurt?

00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:00.411
- What if he's hungry?

00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:02.162
Don't get your noodles in a twist.

00:03:02.162 --> 00:03:06.709
If I know our son, he's probably just
kicking back and catching some rays.

00:03:11.422 --> 00:03:14.216
Kung fu!

00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:17.511
Whoa! That's bad.

00:03:18.262 --> 00:03:20.389
Whoa! Getting worse.

00:03:21.807 --> 00:03:22.808
Whoa!

00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:25.644
Ah, come on!

00:03:42.453 --> 00:03:44.830
Ha-ha!

00:03:49.418 --> 00:03:52.546
Okay, big guy.
We're really gonna have to wrap this up.

00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:06.644
Whee!

00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:09.146
- Oink.
- Oink.

00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:10.231
- Again, again!

00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:12.149
- That was fun.
- Let's do that again.

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:16.986
And next time,
keep your surf off their turf.

00:04:22.368 --> 00:04:24.995
I'm late. I'm late. Ooh, I'm late.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.415
The Dragon Warrior is back!
- It's the Dragon Warrior!

00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:31.043
Was, is and always will be.

00:04:31.043 --> 00:04:32.920
We love you, Dragon Warrior!

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.547
And I love you too, adoring fan.

00:04:34.547 --> 00:04:36.131
Sign my scroll.
Sign my hat.

00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:37.299
- Sign my shirt.
Okay, okay.

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:38.717
I'll sign whatever you want.

00:04:39.552 --> 00:04:40.594
Po!

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:42.721
Master Shifu!

00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:44.348
Here, let me just--

00:04:45.057 --> 00:04:47.810
There, that's much... worse.

00:04:49.103 --> 00:04:50.145
We have to talk.

00:04:50.145 --> 00:04:53.023
Absolutely. Let's talk.
Right after the ceremony.

00:04:53.023 --> 00:04:55.109
- Let's go!
- Ceremony?

00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:56.402
What ceremony?

00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:58.863
The Staff of Wisdom.
Ooh.

00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:01.657
- Given to me by Master Oogway himself.
Aah.

00:05:01.657 --> 00:05:03.826
It is said that
whoever possesses this staff

00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:06.787
has the power
to travel between the realms.

00:05:06.787 --> 00:05:09.707
The power to unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm.

00:05:09.707 --> 00:05:12.126
And now, the power to open...

00:05:12.126 --> 00:05:16.922
the all-new
Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

00:05:18.674 --> 00:05:23.053
Where the broth has kick
and the bean curd's a knockout.

00:05:27.224 --> 00:05:28.559
Dragon Warrior!

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:30.686
Will the Furious Five be here too?

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:32.062
Unfortunately, no.

00:05:32.062 --> 00:05:34.732
They're off on
super cool kung fu missions.

00:05:34.732 --> 00:05:37.193
Tigress is taking on
the free-range chicken gang.

00:05:37.193 --> 00:05:39.403
Monkey's hot on the trail
of the missing macaque.

00:05:39.403 --> 00:05:41.238
Crane was crowned
king of the Crocodilians.

00:05:41.238 --> 00:05:42.615
Crane!
Long story.

00:05:42.615 --> 00:05:45.492
Viper's wrapping up peace talks
between the cobras and the mongooses.

00:05:45.492 --> 00:05:46.452
Or is it mongeese?

00:05:46.452 --> 00:05:47.745
And Mantis?

00:05:47.745 --> 00:05:50.789
Well, he's just trying to keep his
blushing bride from biting his head off.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.418
Just 'cause they're not here in person

00:05:54.418 --> 00:05:57.087
doesn't mean they're not here
as life-sized cut-outs.

00:05:57.087 --> 00:06:00.174
Now, who wants a picture?
Okay, okay. One at a time.

00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:01.967
- Oh! Me, me, me! Me!
- You.

00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:04.637
My turn! My turn!

00:06:04.637 --> 00:06:05.721
And then you.

00:06:11.477 --> 00:06:13.562
He really captured
your disapproving scowl.

00:06:13.562 --> 00:06:14.772
We need to talk.

00:06:15.814 --> 00:06:17.441
- Now.

00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:19.527
Hey, can I get one of those
in a wallet size?

00:06:19.527 --> 00:06:20.861
Po!
- Coming.

00:06:22.947 --> 00:06:26.325
Do you remember the first time you climbed
these steps to the Jade Palace?

00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:30.120
How could I forget?
I thought I'd never make it to the top.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.622
Yes, but you persevered.

00:06:31.622 --> 00:06:35.876
And once again, destiny calls for you
to take the next step on your journey.

00:06:35.876 --> 00:06:37.795
The next step?
What are you talking about?

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:40.172
I've already taken all the steps.
Haven't I?

00:06:40.172 --> 00:06:42.967
It is time for you
to choose your successor.

00:06:42.967 --> 00:06:44.385
Successor for what?

00:06:44.385 --> 00:06:47.805
A successor to be
the next Dragon Warrior.

00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:49.765
Oh... [chuckles] Yeah, I get it.

00:06:49.765 --> 00:06:52.184
Funny, 'cause I'm the Dragon Warrior.

00:06:55.563 --> 00:06:56.897
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

00:06:56.897 --> 00:06:59.650
You mean, I'm not gonna be
the Dragon Warrior anymore?

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.610
- Exactly.
- Then what am I gonna be?

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.279
Once a successor is chosen,

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.407
you will advance
to the highest level in all of kung fu.

00:07:06.407 --> 00:07:09.493
Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Peace.

00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:11.871
Whoa.

00:07:12.705 --> 00:07:14.331
I don't know what that means.

00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:16.750
It's just like
Master Oogway before you.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.380
You will oversee the Valley,
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.632
Look, I appreciate the promotion.

00:07:23.632 --> 00:07:27.261
I think I'm just gonna stick with
the whole "Dragon Warrior" thing.

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:30.180
Dragon Warrior "thing"?
What is it you're holding?

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.348
A cookie.

00:07:31.348 --> 00:07:32.641
Other hand.

00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:34.351
The Staff of Wisdom.

00:07:34.351 --> 00:07:36.353
It was given to you
by Master Oogway.

00:07:36.353 --> 00:07:38.689
Do you really think it was so you could
open a restaurant?

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:39.940
Or pose for pictures?

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.692
He wasn't super specific.

00:07:41.692 --> 00:07:45.988
Oogway entrusted you with that staff
so you could follow in his footsteps

00:07:45.988 --> 00:07:48.949
and become something better
than you already are.

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:50.201
You take it.

00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:52.828
No. Oogway did not give it to me.

00:07:52.828 --> 00:07:56.290
Being the next Oogway is not my destiny,
which I have accepted

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.583
and am at peace with.

00:07:57.583 --> 00:07:59.627
- Really. It's fine.
- You don't sound fine.

00:07:59.627 --> 00:08:02.254
- You don't sound fine! I'm very fine!
- Okay, you're fine.

00:08:02.254 --> 00:08:03.422
This is an honor.

00:08:03.422 --> 00:08:07.551
Oogway chose you as his successor,
and now you must choose yours.

00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:10.346
Master Shifu,
I finally found something I'm good at,

00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:12.139
and now you want to
just take it away from me?

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:14.308
No one is taking anything away, Po.

00:08:14.308 --> 00:08:16.852
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

00:08:16.852 --> 00:08:19.605
Yeah, but where's the "skadoosh"?
You know what I mean?

00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:21.357
The "shasha-booie"?

00:08:21.357 --> 00:08:22.858
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

00:08:22.858 --> 00:08:25.528
but I don't know anything
about passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:27.571
All I know are two things.

00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:30.908
Kicking butt and taking names.

00:08:30.908 --> 00:08:33.994
And if I'm being completely honest,
I'm not even that good at the name-taking.

00:08:33.994 --> 00:08:36.162
Like, who was
that fire-breathing crocodile?

00:08:36.162 --> 00:08:37.665
I wanna say Steve...

00:08:37.665 --> 00:08:39.999
You were chosen
to bring peace to the Valley,

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:44.338
and there are other ways to bring peace
than simply kicking butt.

00:08:44.338 --> 00:08:46.507
Well, sure. But not any fun ones.

00:08:46.507 --> 00:08:49.843
Please. Being the Dragon Warrior
is all I know.

00:08:49.843 --> 00:08:52.012
- It's who I am.
- Not anymore.

00:08:52.012 --> 00:08:54.181
The Valley of Peace needs
a Spiritual Leader,

00:08:54.181 --> 00:08:56.058
and Master Oogway chose you.

00:08:56.058 --> 00:08:59.019
You'll start interviewing candidates
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:01.522
Candidates? What candidates?

00:09:12.283 --> 00:09:13.742
Awesome!

00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:22.167
No way!

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:26.839
Wow!

00:09:27.464 --> 00:09:28.883
Skadoosh.

00:09:28.883 --> 00:09:30.301
Fantastic pose.

00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:42.688
Whoo-hoo! Nice.

00:09:44.023 --> 00:09:49.195
Master Po will now choose
the next Dragon Warrior.

00:09:51.113 --> 00:09:54.074
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

00:09:54.074 --> 00:09:58.078
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

00:09:58.871 --> 00:10:00.206
So many great candidates.

00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:03.209
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

00:10:04.168 --> 00:10:06.378
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

00:10:06.378 --> 00:10:08.255
What is happening?

00:10:08.964 --> 00:10:11.592
The Dragon Warrior. It's me!

00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:20.142
Like it or not, Po,
you have to choose a successor.

00:10:20.142 --> 00:10:24.104
Eh. Nothing about them
says "dragon" or "warrior."

00:10:24.104 --> 00:10:25.814
You will know when you know.

00:10:25.814 --> 00:10:28.609
How do I know when I know?
You know?

00:10:29.652 --> 00:10:33.072
When I'm conflicted, I come here
to ask the universe for answers.

00:10:33.656 --> 00:10:35.324
Just as Oogway did before me.

00:10:35.324 --> 00:10:38.369
I'm not conflicted.
I'm just not ready for a next step.

00:10:38.369 --> 00:10:39.578
What is that you're holding?

00:10:39.578 --> 00:10:41.038
The Staff of Wisdom?

00:10:41.038 --> 00:10:42.122
Other hand.

00:10:42.122 --> 00:10:43.707
A chewed-up peach pit?

00:10:43.707 --> 00:10:45.167
Exactly.

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:49.547
Every pit holds the promise
of a mighty tree.

00:10:49.547 --> 00:10:51.799
Uh, how is this gonna help me
find the answers?

00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:54.969
Don't ask me. Ask the universe.

00:10:54.969 --> 00:10:57.638
Be the pit, Po. Be the pit.

00:11:00.724 --> 00:11:01.976
There we go.

00:11:01.976 --> 00:11:03.602
All right, universe.

00:11:04.728 --> 00:11:06.272
Give me some guidance.

00:11:07.982 --> 00:11:09.483
Inner peace.

00:11:10.359 --> 00:11:11.735
Inner peace.

00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:13.779
Inner peace.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.614
Dinner, please.

00:11:16.198 --> 00:11:17.658
Dinner with peas.

00:11:18.492 --> 00:11:19.827
Snow peas?

00:11:19.827 --> 00:11:22.079
In a sesame soy glaze.

00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:24.498
Inner peace.

00:11:25.207 --> 00:11:26.375
Inner peace.

00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:30.546
This is not working at all.

00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:32.214
Maybe focus on your breathing?

00:11:32.214 --> 00:11:34.967
I'm trying, but it's kinda hard
when you keep talking to me.

00:11:34.967 --> 00:11:37.803
Technically, you're talking to you,
if you think about it.

00:11:37.803 --> 00:11:40.556
Hey, will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:42.892
Wait, if I'm Po's inner voice,
then who are you?

00:11:42.892 --> 00:11:44.935
Uh, I'm Po's inner, inner voice.

00:11:44.935 --> 00:11:46.520
How many voices do I have in there?

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.689
- You do not want to know.
- This dirt is itchy.

00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:50.357
- I just love kung fu.
- What am I gonna be?

00:11:50.357 --> 00:11:53.194
- Are we alone in the universe?
- You guys thought it was awesome, right?

00:11:55.863 --> 00:11:57.281
Anyone want a cookie?

00:12:03.746 --> 00:12:04.747
Universe?

00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:08.292
Is that you?

00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:28.145
Attention, mysterious figure!

00:12:28.729 --> 00:12:32.441
The Dragon Warrior's here
to perform justice.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.197
I know you're in here.

00:12:38.197 --> 00:12:40.824
Just a matter of time before I find you.

00:12:42.451 --> 00:12:43.452
Ooh.

00:12:52.253 --> 00:12:54.547
You can't hide from justice forever.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.054
The Dagger of Deng Wa.

00:13:02.054 --> 00:13:04.014
You've got excellent taste,
I'll give you that.

00:13:04.723 --> 00:13:06.350
But I can't give you that.
Give it back.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.102
If you insist.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.240
- Oh, no!

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.535
He's got a walking stick.
What are you gonna do? Stroll me to death?

00:13:24.535 --> 00:13:28.163
This stick is not for the strolling.
It's the Staff of Wisdom.

00:13:28.163 --> 00:13:30.833
The Dragon Warrior is gonna be mad
when he finds out you took his stick.

00:13:30.833 --> 00:13:32.751
I am the Dragon Warrior.

00:13:33.878 --> 00:13:37.214
I'm just gonna say it. Nothing about you
says "dragon" or "warrior."

00:13:46.932 --> 00:13:49.393
Whoa.

00:13:50.603 --> 00:13:52.021
Hi-yah!

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.150
How dare you desecrate the Hall of Heroes?

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.693
Who's desecrating what now?

00:13:57.693 --> 00:13:59.486
Master Ostrich's Egg!

00:13:59.486 --> 00:14:02.198
Oops, my bad. Hi-yah!

00:14:02.198 --> 00:14:04.575
The Indestructible Chain Hammer
of Master Pangolin.

00:14:04.575 --> 00:14:05.826
Whoopsies.

00:14:09.955 --> 00:14:11.332
Ha-ha! [grunts] Oh!

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.049
The Urn of Whispering Warriors!

00:14:20.049 --> 00:14:22.593
Which I've already broken! Twice!

00:14:23.844 --> 00:14:26.764
Why would you keep an urn of souls?
Feels kinda creepy.

00:14:29.725 --> 00:14:32.603
Are you doing okay there, big guy?
You're looking a little tired.

00:14:32.603 --> 00:14:34.480
- I've never felt more awake!

00:14:37.274 --> 00:14:39.026
The War Hammer of Master Chipmunk?

00:14:42.613 --> 00:14:43.948
You're gonna pay for that.

00:14:47.618 --> 00:14:48.577
Hello?

00:14:59.463 --> 00:15:00.631
You faker.

00:15:00.631 --> 00:15:02.716
It's not faking. It's called Method.

00:15:03.217 --> 00:15:05.010
Catch ya later, panda.

00:15:05.719 --> 00:15:06.845
No.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.062
I think I'll catch you now.

00:15:20.776 --> 00:15:21.861
Whoa!

00:15:28.617 --> 00:15:29.702
Whoa!

00:15:31.078 --> 00:15:32.121
Whoa!

00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:36.709
Told ya.

00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:39.837
You got me,
oh-great-and-powerful Dumpling Warrior.

00:15:39.837 --> 00:15:41.797
That's Dragon Warrior--

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.341
Let go of me.

00:15:44.341 --> 00:15:45.676
Just tell me one thing.

00:15:45.676 --> 00:15:48.095
How did someone like you
become the Dragon Warrior?

00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:50.389
That's a mystery for you to solve
during your two-year stay

00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:51.807
at the Valley of Peace prison.

00:15:51.807 --> 00:15:54.768
Valley of Peace prison?
Sounds like a day care.

00:15:54.768 --> 00:15:56.520
It is a day care on the weekends.

00:15:57.104 --> 00:15:58.731
But it's also a prison.

00:15:58.731 --> 00:15:59.940
There he is!

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:00.983
Dragon Warrior!

00:16:00.983 --> 00:16:02.985
Tai Lung is back.
- Tai Lung has returned?

00:16:02.985 --> 00:16:06.155
He demanded all of our iron,
then destroyed our quarry.

00:16:06.155 --> 00:16:08.741
- He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.
- Well, he's back.

00:16:08.741 --> 00:16:11.619
He said that he's not gonna stop
until the Valley of Peace falls

00:16:11.619 --> 00:16:13.954
and the Dragon Warrior
bows before him.

00:16:13.954 --> 00:16:16.123
- He's back.
- Please, you've got to do something.

00:16:16.832 --> 00:16:20.169
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

00:16:20.169 --> 00:16:22.171
Well, you know what they say...

00:16:22.171 --> 00:16:27.009
every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

00:16:46.278 --> 00:16:51.200
Every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

00:16:56.288 --> 00:16:58.624
Very clever, fox. You know something.

00:16:58.624 --> 00:17:00.793
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

00:17:01.293 --> 00:17:03.170
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.838
- Tell me.
- And why should I?

00:17:04.838 --> 00:17:06.048
I mean, what's in it for me?

00:17:06.048 --> 00:17:08.133
The peace of mind
knowing you did the right thing.

00:17:08.133 --> 00:17:10.678
You're adorable.
Has anyone ever told you that?

00:17:10.678 --> 00:17:12.471
And I don't mean just in, like,
the cuddly sense.

00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:13.764
I don't have time for games.

00:17:13.764 --> 00:17:15.933
Tai Lung is running loose
in the Valley of Peace.

00:17:15.933 --> 00:17:20.104
Maybe. Or maybe she wants you to think
it was Tai Lung.

00:17:20.104 --> 00:17:21.355
Wait. She?

00:17:21.355 --> 00:17:22.648
Mine!

00:17:23.482 --> 00:17:26.694
The Empress of Disguise,
capable of taking any form,

00:17:26.694 --> 00:17:27.986
mimicking any shape.

00:17:27.986 --> 00:17:29.113
The master of deception.

00:17:29.113 --> 00:17:31.490
The lizard of lies
with the glowing teal eyes.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.700
I'm talking 'bout...

00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:35.452
The Chameleon.

00:17:37.496 --> 00:17:39.707
This is kind of a private conversation.

00:17:40.916 --> 00:17:42.459
Who's The Chameleon?

00:17:42.459 --> 00:17:44.837
Only the most powerful
shape-shifting sorceress.

00:17:44.837 --> 00:17:47.298
So she shape-shifted into Tai Lung.

00:17:47.798 --> 00:17:49.967
But what does she have against me
and the Valley of Peace?

00:17:49.967 --> 00:17:52.136
These are good questions.
You should ask her.

00:17:52.136 --> 00:17:56.056
You're right.
How do I find this "The Chameleon"?

00:17:56.056 --> 00:17:57.725
She isn't someone who can be found.

00:17:57.725 --> 00:18:00.519
At least not without someone in the know.

00:18:00.519 --> 00:18:03.397
And how do I find someone "in the know"?

00:18:03.397 --> 00:18:06.483
Oh! It's me.
It's obviously-- It's me.

00:18:06.483 --> 00:18:07.776
I'm in the know.

00:18:07.776 --> 00:18:10.321
Forget it. I'll find her on my own.

00:18:10.946 --> 00:18:11.947
Good luck.

00:18:11.947 --> 00:18:15.117
After all, how hard can it be
to find someone who can look like anyone,

00:18:15.117 --> 00:18:16.410
blend in anywhere?

00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:22.374
Fine. You lead me to The Chameleon,

00:18:22.374 --> 00:18:24.752
and I'll see what I can do
about reducing your sentence.

00:18:24.752 --> 00:18:26.045
Deal.

00:18:27.129 --> 00:18:28.255
Po!

00:18:28.255 --> 00:18:29.548
What do you think you're doing?

00:18:29.548 --> 00:18:33.010
There's this shape-shifting
sorceress on the loose and--

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.095
That's a job for the Furious Five.

00:18:35.095 --> 00:18:38.140
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.017
Look, I know that change is difficult

00:18:40.017 --> 00:18:42.561
and that you enjoy
being the Dragon Warrior,

00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:45.022
but your job is finding a successor.

00:18:45.022 --> 00:18:48.484
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal.
Mind your own business, squirrel.

00:18:48.484 --> 00:18:50.194
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

00:18:50.194 --> 00:18:51.445
I'm a red panda.

00:18:52.821 --> 00:18:54.573
You know what? I love that for you.

00:18:54.573 --> 00:18:56.200
Po, this is your decision.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.663
But I think you know what choice
Master Oogway would want you to make.

00:19:05.584 --> 00:19:07.419
- Thanks for the free stay.
What are you doing?

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:08.837
- Little dank for a day care.
- Wait!

00:19:08.837 --> 00:19:10.381
- Not bad for a jail.
- Where is she going?

00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:11.465
You can't leave.

00:19:11.465 --> 00:19:14.718
Don't worry, I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

00:19:14.718 --> 00:19:17.930
You are supposed to be
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope!

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.683
Just think of it as
one last Dragon Warrior adventure.

00:19:20.683 --> 00:19:23.060
I'll be back soon.
Tell my dads I love 'em.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.396
- I can't hear you anymore! Bye!

00:19:28.107 --> 00:19:31.443
Yeah! It sure is good
to be a free fox again.

00:19:31.443 --> 00:19:33.112
That's a good back scratcher.

00:19:33.112 --> 00:19:34.446
- Yoink!
- Hey!

00:19:34.446 --> 00:19:36.699
So, does this really unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm?

00:19:36.699 --> 00:19:38.325
It doesn't work like that.

00:19:38.325 --> 00:19:41.120
It has to be given
in order to gain its powers.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.081
Gotcha. Given to gain.
So, can I have it?

00:19:44.081 --> 00:19:45.833
No! What do you take me for?

00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:46.917
An easy mark.

00:19:46.917 --> 00:19:48.002
What's an easy mark?

00:19:48.002 --> 00:19:49.670
Someone who's easy to steal from,

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.881
usually because they're generous
and too trusting.

00:19:51.881 --> 00:19:54.049
- Like you.
- Aw, thank you.

00:19:56.385 --> 00:20:00.764
I heard The Chameleon is a monster
with an appetite of a thousand predators,

00:20:00.764 --> 00:20:02.892
and her favorite food is panda.

00:20:02.892 --> 00:20:06.687
They say this Chameleon character
has magical powers.

00:20:06.687 --> 00:20:10.441
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night!

00:20:11.984 --> 00:20:15.905
The Chameleon can shape-shift
to look like anyone, even you.

00:20:15.905 --> 00:20:17.406
Or you.

00:20:20.743 --> 00:20:22.995
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

00:20:22.995 --> 00:20:25.789
Po's going to
take down an evil sorceress?

00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:27.750
The-- The Chameleon?

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.086
Well, a Dragon Warrior's work
is never done.

00:20:31.086 --> 00:20:34.340
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming up
with a convicted felon

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.219
to take down an evil sorceress
wasn't such a great idea.

00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:43.182
Relax. Po has faced demons, demigods,
and everything else in between.

00:20:43.182 --> 00:20:44.391
He's always come out on top.

00:20:44.391 --> 00:20:46.602
You're right. You're right.

00:20:46.602 --> 00:20:48.479
But what if you're wrong?

00:20:48.479 --> 00:20:50.231
Calm down, Ping.

00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:53.234
How bad can one evil sorceress be?

00:20:55.194 --> 00:20:57.655
Who is she to summon us?

00:20:57.655 --> 00:20:58.906
Classic power move.

00:20:58.906 --> 00:21:02.284
We're the heads of Juniper City's
most prominent crime families.

00:21:02.284 --> 00:21:05.913
And she's just some bug-eyed,
power-hungry reptilian runt.

00:21:05.913 --> 00:21:07.623
You left out the evil sorceress part.

00:21:07.623 --> 00:21:09.500
We used to run this city.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.086
Now we pay her half the money we swindle.

00:21:12.086 --> 00:21:14.672
It's like a criminal can't
make an honest living anymore.

00:21:14.672 --> 00:21:16.173
Yeah, but what could we do?

00:21:17.091 --> 00:21:19.385
Together, we can take her down.

00:21:19.385 --> 00:21:22.304
- Are you nuts? She's a shape-shifter.

00:21:22.304 --> 00:21:26.308
She could be at this very table,
and we'd have no idea.

00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:30.187
For all we know,
you're The Chameleon.

00:21:30.187 --> 00:21:32.106
Or you're The Chameleon.

00:21:32.106 --> 00:21:33.858
- Or maybe...
- Oh, no.

00:21:33.858 --> 00:21:35.234
- Maybe...
- Don't say it.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.528
...I'm The Chameleon.

00:21:37.528 --> 00:21:38.737
I said don't say it.

00:21:46.328 --> 00:21:48.163
We obviously spoke out of turn.

00:21:48.163 --> 00:21:49.248
Sorry, Chameleon.

00:21:49.248 --> 00:21:51.125
No, no. Don't apologize.

00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:55.629
You and your families prospered
by preying upon the weak,

00:21:55.629 --> 00:21:59.383
so it doesn't feel good
when you're the one being squeezed.

00:21:59.383 --> 00:22:02.052
Especially when the one
doing the squeezing

00:22:02.052 --> 00:22:05.556
is just a "bug-eyed, power-hungry"...

00:22:05.556 --> 00:22:07.141
What was the rest?

00:22:07.141 --> 00:22:09.059
Reptilian runt.

00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:13.230
Well, this "reptilian runt" wants more.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.274
You already have the city.

00:22:15.274 --> 00:22:17.234
What else could you possibly want?

00:22:17.234 --> 00:22:21.322
I have something special in mind.
I'm very close to achieving it.

00:22:21.322 --> 00:22:24.116
As close as the blood moon.

00:22:24.116 --> 00:22:25.784
But the blood moon
is two nights away.

00:22:25.784 --> 00:22:28.412
So little time, so many expenses.

00:22:28.412 --> 00:22:33.834
Which is why I'll need to increase
this month's tribute to 60%.

00:22:33.834 --> 00:22:34.960
No.

00:22:39.882 --> 00:22:41.342
What was that now?

00:22:41.926 --> 00:22:44.428
I mean no disrespect.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.723
Don't worry.

00:22:47.723 --> 00:22:53.687
I forgive you for the impudence
and the backstabbing.

00:22:53.687 --> 00:22:59.109
And the blatant disrespect
you've shown me, I forgive.

00:22:59.693 --> 00:23:01.987
But I never forget.

00:23:01.987 --> 00:23:04.281
You might say I have the memory...

00:23:04.281 --> 00:23:05.491
Oh, don't say it.

00:23:05.491 --> 00:23:07.618
...of an elephant.

00:23:23.384 --> 00:23:26.637
You think
I've pushed you too far?

00:23:26.637 --> 00:23:30.808
Then you, my friend, can't begin to fathom

00:23:30.808 --> 00:23:34.645
just how far I can push.

00:23:40.651 --> 00:23:43.737
I'll expect your tributes by dawn.

00:23:47.533 --> 00:23:49.702
Are we gonna stop
for lunch soon?

00:23:49.702 --> 00:23:51.787
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

00:23:51.787 --> 00:23:54.665
But it does take the occasional time-out
for snackage.

00:23:54.665 --> 00:23:56.458
Wanna split my almond cookie?

00:23:56.458 --> 00:24:00.045
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

00:24:00.045 --> 00:24:02.423
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

00:24:02.423 --> 00:24:03.382
The "bam-what-le"?

00:24:03.382 --> 00:24:05.426
You know, the fleece.
The rook. The flimflam.

00:24:05.426 --> 00:24:07.011
Do you want the cookie or not?

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.474
I got my eye on you.

00:24:14.435 --> 00:24:16.979
How much farther is it
to this "The Chameleon"?

00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:18.188
Just a little farther.

00:24:33.078 --> 00:24:36.624
Li! What are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

00:24:36.624 --> 00:24:40.294
Well, I-- I-- I... didn't wanna miss
the blood moon rising.

00:24:40.294 --> 00:24:43.047
Oh, pooh.
You are just as worried as I am.

00:24:43.047 --> 00:24:44.465
All right, all right.

00:24:44.465 --> 00:24:47.301
I know pandas come across as
calm, gentle and chill,

00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:49.637
but... [chuckles] ...the truth is

00:24:49.637 --> 00:24:51.222
I'm kinda freaking out!

00:24:51.222 --> 00:24:52.264
So am I.

00:24:52.264 --> 00:24:56.560
Po is just too calm, gentle and chill
to face a shape-shifting sorceress.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.438
- What if he's captured?
- What if he's tortured?

00:24:59.438 --> 00:25:01.357
Our baby!

00:25:02.483 --> 00:25:03.943
Okay, okay.

00:25:03.943 --> 00:25:06.195
Maybe Po has finally met his match,

00:25:06.195 --> 00:25:10.157
but there is still something that he has
that The Chameleon does not.

00:25:10.157 --> 00:25:12.284
- What's that?
- Us.

00:25:12.284 --> 00:25:15.204
Now, let's go find our son.

00:25:15.204 --> 00:25:16.413
I hope Po's okay.

00:25:16.413 --> 00:25:19.458
You know, Li,
a wise goose once said,

00:25:19.458 --> 00:25:22.503
"Worrying doesn't make
the broth boil any faster."

00:25:22.503 --> 00:25:25.005
Who was that idiot?
Me, of course.

00:25:25.005 --> 00:25:26.549
I was the wise goose.

00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:28.300
Oh, yeah.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.219
Whoa.

00:25:30.219 --> 00:25:32.263
That's the biggest village I've ever seen.

00:25:32.263 --> 00:25:34.056
That's no village.

00:25:34.056 --> 00:25:36.016
That's Juniper City.

00:25:36.016 --> 00:25:37.851
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

00:25:37.851 --> 00:25:39.395
Just a boat ride away.

00:25:39.395 --> 00:25:41.981
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

00:25:41.981 --> 00:25:43.941
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

00:25:43.941 --> 00:25:46.819
For the right price, those cutthroats will
take us anywhere we want to go.

00:25:47.403 --> 00:25:50.531
Of course, we could always opt for
the four-finger discount.

00:25:50.531 --> 00:25:51.824
No stealing.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.326
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

00:25:54.326 --> 00:25:56.203
Well, that sounds inviting.

00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:03.127
Anybody lose a rabbit?

00:26:09.341 --> 00:26:10.634
Stir faster!

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.140
Welcome to the Happy Bunny Tavern.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.976
I'll find us a ride.
Maybe you can get us some food.

00:26:19.518 --> 00:26:20.936
And stay out of trouble.

00:26:23.147 --> 00:26:24.565
Hey, what you guys playing?

00:26:24.565 --> 00:26:26.317
Mah-jongg.

00:26:26.317 --> 00:26:27.985
And the stakes are high.

00:26:27.985 --> 00:26:29.069
Can I play?

00:26:29.069 --> 00:26:32.489
Surely you'll go easy on a beginner,
'cause I'm very beginning.

00:26:34.158 --> 00:26:36.368
- Hey there.
- What can I get you?

00:26:36.368 --> 00:26:38.245
A boat ride to Juniper City.

00:26:38.245 --> 00:26:39.330
Ask this guy.

00:26:41.874 --> 00:26:43.876
- Who's he?
- He's the captain.

00:26:43.876 --> 00:26:45.419
- Thanks.

00:26:48.547 --> 00:26:51.342
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

00:26:51.342 --> 00:26:53.219
Never played before, huh?

00:26:53.219 --> 00:26:55.221
I'm sorry, are you accusing me
of cheating?

00:26:55.221 --> 00:26:57.514
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

00:26:57.514 --> 00:26:59.516
I am the manager.

00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:04.230
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper City,
but I won't carry anything illegal.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.606
I don't want any trouble.

00:27:05.606 --> 00:27:07.566
Trouble runs from me.

00:27:07.566 --> 00:27:09.026
Then it'll cost you double.

00:27:09.026 --> 00:27:11.570
I'm confused.
Should I have said that I like trouble?

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.405
In that case, it'll cost you triple.

00:27:13.405 --> 00:27:16.075
Oh. Uh, maybe we can go back
to the double price?

00:27:19.078 --> 00:27:20.496
You got a deal.

00:27:20.496 --> 00:27:23.457
Great.
Do I shake his hand or your hand?

00:27:24.375 --> 00:27:25.876
Can I get anything else for you, ma'am?

00:27:25.876 --> 00:27:27.336
Yes. Everything, again.

00:27:27.336 --> 00:27:29.380
Except for the broth. It was very bland.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.965
- Keep stirring!

00:27:32.466 --> 00:27:35.135
Whoa! One of everything is my go-to order.

00:27:35.928 --> 00:27:37.179
But how did you pay for this?

00:27:37.179 --> 00:27:39.139
Legally. Lawfully. Fair and square.

00:27:39.139 --> 00:27:40.599
- I'm proud of you.

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.695
Oh, wow! Look at the time.

00:27:52.695 --> 00:27:55.614
Remember we have to do that thing
down by the place with that guy?

00:27:55.614 --> 00:28:00.119
Did you actually think you could
grift a meal out of me?

00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:03.163
There's gotta be some sort
of misunderstanding here.

00:28:05.124 --> 00:28:07.585
And apparently,
I'm the one misunderstanding.

00:28:07.585 --> 00:28:10.713
Please allow us to pay for our meal
and yours too.

00:28:10.713 --> 00:28:12.715
I'm only hungry for...

00:28:12.715 --> 00:28:14.174
- Dumplings?
- ...vengeance!

00:28:14.174 --> 00:28:16.135
Well, then, come and get it.

00:28:16.135 --> 00:28:18.137
No! No, no, no! Don't come and get it!

00:28:18.137 --> 00:28:20.180
- Destroy them!

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.903
I got it!

00:28:44.288 --> 00:28:45.414
There you go.

00:28:47.291 --> 00:28:48.834
- All better.

00:28:48.834 --> 00:28:51.587
- Come on! Gotcha.

00:28:51.587 --> 00:28:52.838
Keep stirring!

00:29:01.305 --> 00:29:02.723
Oh, yeah!

00:29:21.742 --> 00:29:22.993
I'll take that.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.373
Think this belongs to you.

00:29:40.344 --> 00:29:41.845
No stealing!

00:29:46.392 --> 00:29:49.103
Yeah, I think it's
a little too late for that.

00:29:49.103 --> 00:29:51.397
It's never too late to do the right thing.

00:29:51.397 --> 00:29:53.023
- Get them!

00:29:53.023 --> 00:29:54.775
Watch out!
- Whoa!

00:30:02.116 --> 00:30:03.993
- Skadoosh!

00:30:10.499 --> 00:30:14.211
- Whoa. Nice move. You gotta teach me that.

00:30:14.211 --> 00:30:16.338
You die, panda!

00:30:29.602 --> 00:30:30.811
Ah! Uh.

00:30:31.353 --> 00:30:33.314
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:30:35.274 --> 00:30:37.401
Who designs a tavern on a cliff?

00:30:37.401 --> 00:30:40.112
I shouldn't have eaten
all those dumplings.

00:30:41.155 --> 00:30:42.698
- Huh?

00:30:42.698 --> 00:30:43.949
Uh-oh.

00:30:48.621 --> 00:30:49.914
Sail ho!

00:30:56.503 --> 00:30:59.423
Back up! Move, move, move!

00:31:02.718 --> 00:31:04.762
- Not that I'm worried, but...

00:31:04.762 --> 00:31:07.181
...what if The Chameleon knows
we're coming?

00:31:07.181 --> 00:31:09.391
Why, she could be anywhere, anyone.

00:31:09.391 --> 00:31:12.269
Li, would you please show
a little backbone?

00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:15.773
I'm sorry, but bravery was never
really my specialty.

00:31:15.773 --> 00:31:20.569
You don't have to be brave.
You just have to act brave.

00:31:20.569 --> 00:31:22.738
Act brave? Got it.

00:31:23.405 --> 00:31:25.407
- Ah!
- Oh!

00:31:25.407 --> 00:31:26.825
Oh, Li!

00:31:26.825 --> 00:31:29.203
- Hold on!

00:31:29.203 --> 00:31:32.039
Hold me, Ping! It's all been for nothing!

00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:33.541
Please, no.

00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:35.960
- I'm too young!

00:31:39.547 --> 00:31:41.257
How was that for acting brave?

00:31:41.257 --> 00:31:43.175
Keep working on it.

00:31:47.221 --> 00:31:49.431
Juniper City.

00:31:49.431 --> 00:31:51.350
It's going to be great
to be back home again.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.352
Does your family live there too?

00:31:53.352 --> 00:31:55.688
They would. If I had a family.

00:31:56.355 --> 00:31:58.858
It wasn't easy being a little fox
in a big city.

00:31:59.775 --> 00:32:02.027
So I had to survive any way I could.

00:32:02.027 --> 00:32:03.070
Hey!

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.198
Grifting. Shilling. Gaffing.

00:32:06.198 --> 00:32:08.826
Stop running! Stop running!

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.917
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

00:32:16.917 --> 00:32:18.377
Well, I mean I was.

00:32:18.377 --> 00:32:22.298
My goose dad adopted me,
and then later, my panda dad found me.

00:32:22.298 --> 00:32:26.010
Goose dads, panda dads.
Guess it takes all kinds.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.553
- Right, Mom?

00:32:28.304 --> 00:32:30.431
Then, one day, a local took me in.

00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:33.893
Put a roof over my head,
gave me clothes to wear, food to eat.

00:32:33.893 --> 00:32:36.270
After that, I was never alone again.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.479
I guess we both got lucky.

00:32:37.479 --> 00:32:38.522
I guess.

00:32:38.522 --> 00:32:40.900
Hey, tell me something.
Back in the Valley of Geese...

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.942
Peace.

00:32:41.942 --> 00:32:43.444
...what did that angry little squirrel
mean...

00:32:43.444 --> 00:32:44.361
Red panda.

00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:46.405
...when he said you had to
find your successor?

00:32:47.573 --> 00:32:49.992
Now that I'm supposed to become
Spiritual Leader,

00:32:49.992 --> 00:32:53.078
I have to find a worthy successor
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

00:32:53.078 --> 00:32:55.247
Once you're on top,
that's where you wanna stay, right?

00:32:55.247 --> 00:32:58.334
No, it's just that-- What do I know
about being a Spiritual Leader?

00:32:58.334 --> 00:33:00.878
I can't even come up with
one of those cool-sounding proverbs.

00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:03.547
"Life's greatest enemy is"...

00:33:03.547 --> 00:33:05.758
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

00:33:06.342 --> 00:33:07.468
Okay.

00:33:07.468 --> 00:33:09.845
Everyone knows
life's greatest enemy is time.

00:33:10.804 --> 00:33:13.891
I guess it's just easier to hold on
to the life you know

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:15.392
than move on to the one you don't.

00:33:15.392 --> 00:33:17.186
Hey, that was pretty good.

00:33:17.186 --> 00:33:18.103
Yeah.

00:33:18.103 --> 00:33:21.941
Maybe she should be the Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Geese.

00:33:23.859 --> 00:33:25.903
Whoa, that guy.
He drinks like a fish.

00:33:25.903 --> 00:33:27.446
Should he be driving?

00:33:52.471 --> 00:33:55.599
We've come to pay tribute,
as you requested.

00:33:55.599 --> 00:33:57.476
Looks a little light.

00:33:57.476 --> 00:33:59.353
Go back out and get me more!

00:33:59.353 --> 00:34:00.271
More?

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:01.438
But-- But, Chameleon--

00:34:01.438 --> 00:34:05.067
Go! Before I toss you
down another flight of stairs.

00:34:07.903 --> 00:34:11.198
At last, my destiny approaches.

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:20.415
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City
to every city and town and village

00:34:20.415 --> 00:34:24.044
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond!

00:34:28.424 --> 00:34:33.344
They will all know the name
of The Chameleon!

00:34:33.344 --> 00:34:34.680
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:38.893
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.
I saw The Chameleon.

00:34:38.893 --> 00:34:41.937
She's gonna take over cities and towns
and the Valley of Peace.

00:34:41.937 --> 00:34:43.647
A vision?

00:34:43.647 --> 00:34:45.190
While you were asleep?

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.609
I'm pretty sure that's just a dream.

00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:48.402
Not a dream, a vision.

00:34:48.402 --> 00:34:50.487
Either I had a bad dumpling
before I went to sleep,

00:34:50.487 --> 00:34:52.323
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

00:34:52.323 --> 00:34:54.325
We got to get to The Chameleon
and take her down.

00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:56.285
Well, then you're in luck.

00:34:56.285 --> 00:34:58.454
Welcome to Juniper City.

00:35:03.667 --> 00:35:05.085
Whoa!

00:35:07.546 --> 00:35:10.382
This is the place where you can be
whatever you wanna be,

00:35:10.382 --> 00:35:12.676
do whatever you wanna do,

00:35:12.676 --> 00:35:15.971
and steal whatever you wanna steal.

00:35:15.971 --> 00:35:17.056
Uh, if that's your thing.

00:35:17.056 --> 00:35:20.684
Land ho!

00:35:21.936 --> 00:35:23.896
Whoa. That came out of nowhere.

00:35:34.323 --> 00:35:35.199
Ah!

00:35:36.408 --> 00:35:37.576
- Whoa!
- Move!

00:35:37.576 --> 00:35:39.328
- Look out!
- Sorry!

00:35:39.328 --> 00:35:40.412
Out of the way!

00:35:41.247 --> 00:35:43.207
I've never seen so much traffic before.

00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:45.292
You don't have rush hour
in the Valley of Peace?

00:35:45.292 --> 00:35:47.586
No one's ever in that much of a rush. Oof.

00:35:49.255 --> 00:35:50.631
Come on!

00:35:55.261 --> 00:35:57.179
Well, sure is good to be home again.

00:35:57.179 --> 00:35:59.014
The sights. The sounds.

00:35:59.014 --> 00:36:01.725
The smells.

00:36:05.938 --> 00:36:09.567
It's a wonton wonderland!

00:36:11.694 --> 00:36:12.736
Yeah!

00:36:16.031 --> 00:36:17.658
Po. Po!

00:36:17.658 --> 00:36:19.159
Focus!

00:36:19.159 --> 00:36:21.245
This city is the most amazing place
I've ever seen!

00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:24.623
I used to feel the same way
until The Chameleon got her claws into it.

00:36:35.885 --> 00:36:38.012
Tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

00:36:38.012 --> 00:36:39.138
Oh, yeah.

00:36:39.138 --> 00:36:42.808
I'll show you where this villainous
sorceress lurks as she dominates the city.

00:36:42.808 --> 00:36:45.853
Is she lurking in that villainous tower
dominating the city?

00:36:47.646 --> 00:36:48.647
How'd you know?

00:36:48.647 --> 00:36:50.649
Eh, not my first time
taking down a villain.

00:36:50.649 --> 00:36:51.734
Let's keep moving.

00:36:51.734 --> 00:36:53.152
Hey, Zhen!
- Heya, Zhen.

00:36:53.152 --> 00:36:54.320
Long time no see.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.237
How you doing, Zhen?

00:36:55.237 --> 00:36:57.489
Wow, you're quite the local celeb.

00:36:57.489 --> 00:37:00.743
Yeah, well, let's just say
a face like mine is hard to forget.

00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:05.581
What? You're a wanted criminal?

00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:09.168
You sound surprised. Is this surprising?
I don't think this is surprising.

00:37:09.168 --> 00:37:11.170
You never mentioned
you were wanted.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.504
Don't worry.

00:37:12.504 --> 00:37:14.715
The law has better things to do
than look for me.

00:37:14.715 --> 00:37:17.343
- Hey, fox.
- We've been looking for you.

00:37:17.343 --> 00:37:18.469
Must be a slow workweek.

00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:19.720
I'll handle this.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.890
Morning, officers.
Dragon Warrior here.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:26.352
The fox and I are here
on official Dragon Warrior biz.

00:37:26.352 --> 00:37:27.978
- Dragon who?
- Warrior what?

00:37:27.978 --> 00:37:29.438
Dragon Warrior.

00:37:29.438 --> 00:37:31.732
Anyone? Nothing?

00:37:31.732 --> 00:37:33.734
Perhaps you know me better as...

00:37:34.401 --> 00:37:36.862
the Kung Fu Panda!

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.907
- Wait, wait!

00:37:39.907 --> 00:37:41.784
Can you believe that guy?

00:37:41.784 --> 00:37:42.952
Aw, come on!

00:37:42.952 --> 00:37:46.247
Okay, so we tried it your way.
Now we try it mine.

00:37:47.873 --> 00:37:52.670
- Wait, what's your way--

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:53.754
Sorry.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.840
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

00:37:57.466 --> 00:38:00.052
You can't run away from the law.
You're a wanted criminal!

00:38:00.052 --> 00:38:02.763
Yeah? Well, it looks like
I'm not the only one.

00:38:02.763 --> 00:38:05.057
Wow. City life really is fast-paced.

00:38:05.057 --> 00:38:07.017
We gotta get out of here
before they call for...

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:10.563
...backup.

00:38:15.317 --> 00:38:16.735
That's a lot of bull.

00:38:16.735 --> 00:38:18.279
- Run!

00:38:24.994 --> 00:38:26.871
- Let's go, let's go!
- Oh!

00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:37.214
Ow!

00:39:04.825 --> 00:39:05.826
Let's go.

00:39:07.328 --> 00:39:09.538
Whoa! Whoa!

00:39:12.082 --> 00:39:13.751
I'm falling...

00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:15.586
very slowly.

00:39:17.296 --> 00:39:19.673
Ow!

00:39:31.101 --> 00:39:32.353
Sorry.

00:39:48.702 --> 00:39:49.662
Whew.

00:39:57.127 --> 00:39:58.128
There they are!

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:02.216
We don't have time for a drum solo!

00:40:03.842 --> 00:40:05.261
We're trapped.

00:40:17.606 --> 00:40:18.691
It isn't much farther now.

00:40:18.691 --> 00:40:21.360
You always say that,
and it's always so much farther.

00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:26.490
Whoa. What is this place?

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:27.950
Home sweet home.

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.537
Some of the best crooks and criminals
in all of Juniper City live here.

00:40:33.664 --> 00:40:37.084
Careful. These guys will steal your pants
right off ya, and you'll never know it.

00:40:40.462 --> 00:40:41.797
Uh-oh.

00:40:41.797 --> 00:40:44.049
Now, you kids be careful
with those fireworks.

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:49.763
Ooh!

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.186
Ow!

00:41:00.566 --> 00:41:03.485
Oh!

00:41:03.485 --> 00:41:05.738
So you're friends
with all these people?

00:41:05.738 --> 00:41:07.031
They're practically family.

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.365
Zhen!

00:41:13.495 --> 00:41:15.706
Oh! Is that really you?

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:18.167
Han, my old mentor.

00:41:18.167 --> 00:41:21.128
I always knew someday you'll find your way
home back to the den.

00:41:21.128 --> 00:41:22.588
And when you did...

00:41:24.173 --> 00:41:27.218
...I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

00:41:27.218 --> 00:41:28.552
Family, huh?

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:29.887
More like distant cousins.

00:41:29.887 --> 00:41:31.805
All right. How should we do this?

00:41:31.805 --> 00:41:34.975
Quick and painless?
Or slow and painful?

00:41:34.975 --> 00:41:38.395
Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

00:41:38.395 --> 00:41:41.148
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

00:41:41.148 --> 00:41:42.691
- Hooray!
- Yay!

00:41:42.691 --> 00:41:44.276
You really don't wanna do this.

00:41:44.276 --> 00:41:45.361
And why is that?

00:41:45.361 --> 00:41:47.613
Because if you so much as
lay one claw on me,

00:41:47.613 --> 00:41:49.281
you're gonna have to answer to...

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:51.992
the Dragon Warrior.

00:41:51.992 --> 00:41:54.620
Warrior, warrior, warrior,
warrior, warrior.

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:56.914
Who?

00:41:59.333 --> 00:42:02.628
Oh, man. Are my adventures
really that regional?

00:42:02.628 --> 00:42:04.046
Introduce them, Po,

00:42:04.964 --> 00:42:07.132
to your fists.

00:42:12.179 --> 00:42:16.392
Remember, Po, there are other ways
to bring peace than by kicking butt.

00:42:16.392 --> 00:42:18.394
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

00:42:18.394 --> 00:42:20.271
Yes, now.

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:23.607
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner Shifus
have differing opinions?

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:24.984
We are in total agreement...

00:42:24.984 --> 00:42:26.986
...with our mutual disappointment...

00:42:26.986 --> 00:42:28.153
...in you.

00:42:29.989 --> 00:42:30.990
Wait.

00:42:32.241 --> 00:42:35.661
He who resorts to violence now...

00:42:36.871 --> 00:42:40.207
will only find more violence later.

00:42:40.207 --> 00:42:41.166
Huh?

00:42:42.668 --> 00:42:46.714
So what you're saying is,
if we don't hurt Zhen a little now...

00:42:46.714 --> 00:42:48.674
We can hurt her a lot later.

00:42:48.674 --> 00:42:50.509
What? No, that's not what I said.

00:42:50.509 --> 00:42:54.555
Yes! And more violence later
is better than less violence now.

00:42:54.555 --> 00:42:56.932
No, no. I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of--

00:42:56.932 --> 00:42:58.350
- More violence!
- Hooray!

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.936
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

00:43:00.936 --> 00:43:03.063
You know, that panda
makes a lot of good points.

00:43:03.063 --> 00:43:06.692
- I like it.
Violence, violence, violence.

00:43:06.692 --> 00:43:07.902
No, no, no! Wait!

00:43:07.902 --> 00:43:08.986
Come back!

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.946
I'll come up with better wisdom.

00:43:11.739 --> 00:43:13.908
You have got to workshop
those proverbs.

00:43:15.618 --> 00:43:17.953
Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?
- Nope.

00:43:17.953 --> 00:43:19.788
The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

00:43:19.788 --> 00:43:21.707
Those are both very common names.

00:43:21.707 --> 00:43:23.500
- Mentored by Oogway?
- Sorry.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.169
Trained by Master Shifu?

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:27.379
- Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.
- Aha!

00:43:27.379 --> 00:43:29.840
Everyone's heard of
the legendary Master Shifu.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.883
But not you.

00:43:31.884 --> 00:43:34.345
Did someone say "legendary"?
Bring it in.

00:43:36.722 --> 00:43:37.723
Look, Han.

00:43:37.723 --> 00:43:40.726
I know we've had our differences,
but I'm really in a jam here,

00:43:40.726 --> 00:43:42.436
and I was hoping
you could help me out.

00:43:42.436 --> 00:43:44.271
- Thank you.
- Don't drink that.

00:43:46.232 --> 00:43:49.735
Oh!

00:43:49.735 --> 00:43:52.863
We just need someplace to lie low
for a while until the heat cools off.

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:54.406
And why should I help you?

00:43:54.406 --> 00:43:57.076
Because deep down
beneath that iron-scaled exterior

00:43:57.076 --> 00:43:58.577
is a good-hearted soul

00:43:58.577 --> 00:44:00.496
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:02.665
Fine.

00:44:02.665 --> 00:44:06.210
But if you're still here by nightfall,
I'm calling the bulls myself.

00:44:06.919 --> 00:44:07.878
Sleep tight.

00:44:12.299 --> 00:44:14.218
So tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:15.803
After you get your pants back.

00:44:16.679 --> 00:44:18.389
Not cool! You guys--

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.015
Come on! Give them back.

00:44:20.015 --> 00:44:21.433
Those are custom.

00:44:27.773 --> 00:44:31.151
Yeah, this place doesn't
look very friendly.

00:44:31.986 --> 00:44:34.363
Oh! Oh, my tail.

00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:37.533
I'm sure everything is fine.

00:44:37.533 --> 00:44:38.993
This is a restaurant.

00:44:38.993 --> 00:44:41.996
These are my people.
We speak the same language.

00:44:41.996 --> 00:44:43.247
You wait here.

00:44:45.374 --> 00:44:47.126
Salutations!

00:44:47.126 --> 00:44:49.712
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

00:44:49.712 --> 00:44:51.171
I know you're having a good time,

00:44:51.171 --> 00:44:55.843
but I was wondering if a panda
happened to be passing by these parts?

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:57.887
There was a panda here.

00:44:58.554 --> 00:44:59.638
You know him?

00:44:59.638 --> 00:45:02.433
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:06.729
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

00:45:07.354 --> 00:45:10.941
You need to pay
for what your son did to my tavern.

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:18.240
My boy wouldn't have done this
for no reason.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.201
Is it possible your broth was bland?

00:45:20.201 --> 00:45:21.577
Try it.

00:45:22.077 --> 00:45:24.330
No, no!

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:26.332
The broth smells excellent.

00:45:26.332 --> 00:45:30.085
You should not add a single thing,
especially not me!

00:45:30.085 --> 00:45:31.629
Hands off the goose.

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:36.634
The panda's back.

00:45:36.634 --> 00:45:38.093
- He's back?
- He's back?

00:45:38.093 --> 00:45:39.178
No.

00:45:39.845 --> 00:45:42.932
But you're about to wish he was,

00:45:42.932 --> 00:45:45.392
'cause if you think he made a mess
of this place,

00:45:45.392 --> 00:45:48.354
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

00:45:48.354 --> 00:45:51.315
Everything he learned, he learned from me.

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.528
Except one thing.

00:45:56.111 --> 00:45:57.071
Mercy.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.784
I don't know where he got that,
because I don't believe in it.

00:46:03.118 --> 00:46:06.622
Now, this can go one of two ways.

00:46:06.622 --> 00:46:11.001
The easy way,
in which you tell me where he is,

00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:12.086
or the hard way,

00:46:12.086 --> 00:46:14.838
in which you tell me where he is,

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.799
but it's hard to understand
what you're saying

00:46:16.799 --> 00:46:18.175
because you have no teeth.

00:46:25.432 --> 00:46:26.850
Mah-jongg.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.937
I eat mah-jongg tiles for breakfast!

00:46:57.464 --> 00:46:58.674
Huh?

00:47:10.769 --> 00:47:11.770
Stay there!

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:12.813
Where's our son?

00:47:12.813 --> 00:47:14.690
He took a boat to Juniper City.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:15.858
Which way?

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:19.111
You know, a wise goose once--

00:47:19.111 --> 00:47:20.404
Time to go.

00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:21.739
Uh, yeah. Right.

00:47:52.353 --> 00:47:54.104
Okay, let's try this again.

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:58.859
Stir the pot, roll the wok,
serve the dish, and ska-blam!

00:47:59.985 --> 00:48:02.696
Hey, where's the golden dragon
that's supposed to shoot out?

00:48:02.696 --> 00:48:04.532
Not gonna happen with a broom.

00:48:04.532 --> 00:48:05.699
Yeah? Still not bad though.

00:48:05.699 --> 00:48:11.038
Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,
and the word is "skadoosh."

00:48:11.038 --> 00:48:12.498
"Skadoosh" isn't a word.

00:48:12.498 --> 00:48:14.667
- And "ska-blam" is?

00:48:19.547 --> 00:48:20.631
Ska-blam!

00:48:26.178 --> 00:48:29.765
I gotta say, you're not
like any of the other masters I've met.

00:48:29.765 --> 00:48:31.892
Yeah, I know.
There's not a lot of pandas.

00:48:31.892 --> 00:48:34.812
No, you're, like, a good guy.

00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:37.231
Listen up. The coast is clear.

00:48:37.231 --> 00:48:39.692
Thieves, hit the streets.

00:48:39.692 --> 00:48:41.026
And you two,

00:48:41.026 --> 00:48:42.695
get out of my sight.

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:55.499
Huh?

00:49:03.382 --> 00:49:06.302
I know I promised that I'd lead you
right to The Chameleon's front door,

00:49:06.302 --> 00:49:09.054
but the back door seems
a little more practical.

00:49:09.054 --> 00:49:13.392
I gotta say, Zhen,
you really are a fox of your word.

00:49:13.392 --> 00:49:15.519
A chewed-up peach pit?

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:18.480
One from Master Oogway's peach tree
of heavenly wisdom.

00:49:19.607 --> 00:49:21.859
Eh, it's a Valley of Peace thing.

00:49:21.859 --> 00:49:26.113
It's supposed to remind me that every pit
holds the promise of a mighty tree.

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:30.117
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

00:49:36.415 --> 00:49:37.708
Are you sure you wanna do this?

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:40.586
As a wise Spiritual Leader once said,

00:49:40.586 --> 00:49:45.633
how may one kick butt,
if one doesn't seek a butt to kick?

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:49.887
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

00:49:49.887 --> 00:49:51.138
Thank you.

00:49:51.138 --> 00:49:53.766
Wait, was that a compliment or an insult?

00:49:53.766 --> 00:49:54.892
Yes.

00:50:03.526 --> 00:50:04.485
Whoa.

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.073
Have you seen our son?

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.206
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:50:17.206 --> 00:50:18.499
- Nope.
- Nah.

00:50:18.499 --> 00:50:20.459
Tell us you've seen our son.

00:50:23.087 --> 00:50:25.381
Wait, why are they leaving? You said yes.

00:50:26.215 --> 00:50:29.009
Hey, look. Po was here.

00:50:29.009 --> 00:50:31.470
Amazing, Li, but how can you tell?

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:34.515
Oh, we pandas have a gift
for seeing what others cannot.

00:50:34.515 --> 00:50:36.934
Come on. There may be more clues up ahead.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.345
Why?

00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:07.691
That was close.

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:09.068
Look out!

00:52:09.068 --> 00:52:10.319
Huh?

00:52:12.363 --> 00:52:14.198
- Po!
- Stand back.

00:52:16.784 --> 00:52:18.327
- Whoa!

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:22.289
- They're coming!
- Hurry! Help me lift the cage!

00:52:29.046 --> 00:52:30.130
It's no use.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:33.050
- We gotta brace it with something.
- Here, use my staff.

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:35.219
All right, stand back. Here I go.

00:52:37.346 --> 00:52:38.389
Zhen?

00:52:40.432 --> 00:52:42.184
Where are you taking my staff?

00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:46.897
I think you mean my staff?

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:50.734
You gave it to Zhen,
and now Zhen has given it to me.

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:53.946
"Given to gain,"
I believe, is how it works?

00:52:53.946 --> 00:52:55.573
You were right, Zhen.

00:52:55.573 --> 00:52:56.991
He was an easy mark.

00:52:56.991 --> 00:52:58.367
Zhen...

00:52:58.367 --> 00:53:01.537
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

00:53:01.537 --> 00:53:03.539
I taught her that.

00:53:03.539 --> 00:53:06.250
And you thought my apprentice
was your friend?

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:07.501
Apprentice?

00:53:07.501 --> 00:53:09.420
She's the one that took you in?

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.839
Best thing that ever happened to her.

00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:15.217
You should have seen
the little guttersnipe before I found her.

00:53:15.217 --> 00:53:17.303
Mangy and half-starved,

00:53:18.721 --> 00:53:21.807
hanging out with those rejects
from the Den of Thieves.

00:53:43.287 --> 00:53:44.955
She had no fear.

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:47.750
Such potential.

00:53:54.423 --> 00:53:56.050
So I took her in.

00:53:57.635 --> 00:53:59.929
I made her what she is today.

00:53:59.929 --> 00:54:01.513
Stand up straight.

00:54:01.513 --> 00:54:02.681
Yes, master.

00:54:02.681 --> 00:54:06.352
So you went through all of this just to
get me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

00:54:06.352 --> 00:54:07.436
Why?

00:54:07.436 --> 00:54:13.317
I, too, came from humble beginnings
and dreamed of becoming something more.

00:54:13.859 --> 00:54:15.361
I wanted respect and power.

00:54:15.361 --> 00:54:18.113
I wanted to be a master of kung fu.

00:54:18.113 --> 00:54:19.198
Say what?

00:54:19.198 --> 00:54:22.785
I was turned away
from every training hall I went to.

00:54:22.785 --> 00:54:26.872
They would say I was too small, too lowly,

00:54:26.872 --> 00:54:30.084
and that kung fu was not my destiny.

00:54:30.084 --> 00:54:33.337
And so, I chose a different path.

00:54:33.337 --> 00:54:35.089
Sorcery.

00:54:35.089 --> 00:54:36.340
I grew.

00:54:37.299 --> 00:54:38.634
I excelled.

00:54:38.634 --> 00:54:42.471
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

00:54:42.471 --> 00:54:45.432
- Everything except kung fu.

00:54:45.432 --> 00:54:49.645
Just because I can look like Tai Lung
doesn't mean I can fight like him.

00:54:50.771 --> 00:54:54.900
You see, Po, kung fu may be
performed by the body,

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.987
but its secrets are housed in the spirit.

00:54:57.987 --> 00:55:00.614
And now that I have access
to the Spirit Realm--

00:55:00.614 --> 00:55:02.825
You're gonna steal Tai Lung's kung fu.

00:55:02.825 --> 00:55:06.412
His and those of every master villain
that came before me.

00:55:06.412 --> 00:55:11.333
And once I do, no one will dare
underestimate me again.

00:55:11.333 --> 00:55:13.377
You forgot about me.

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.173
Don't bother, Po.

00:55:18.173 --> 00:55:23.345
Those bars are enchanted with
some very old and very powerful magic.

00:55:23.345 --> 00:55:27.308
You'd need at least ten Dragon Warriors
to get through them.

00:55:27.308 --> 00:55:28.851
Then I won't go through them.

00:55:28.851 --> 00:55:30.978
I'll go under them.

00:55:45.492 --> 00:55:47.912
Well, that's frustrating
for all sorts of reasons.

00:55:56.337 --> 00:55:57.671
Whoa!

00:56:25.241 --> 00:56:27.201
- Po!
- Zhen?

00:56:27.952 --> 00:56:29.328
My staff! Hand it over.

00:56:29.328 --> 00:56:32.331
I'm so sorry I lied to you.
I was just doing what I was told.

00:56:32.331 --> 00:56:34.667
Apologize later.
Right now, I have to stop The Chameleon.

00:56:34.667 --> 00:56:36.418
Po!

00:56:36.418 --> 00:56:37.753
Zhen?

00:56:42.883 --> 00:56:44.385
No!

00:56:50.474 --> 00:56:52.226
Well done, Zhen.

00:56:52.226 --> 00:56:54.436
You never said you were gonna hurt him.

00:56:54.436 --> 00:56:56.647
What's the second rule
of the streets?

00:56:57.606 --> 00:56:59.233
Someone always gets hurt.

00:56:59.233 --> 00:57:01.318
And make sure it's never you.

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:05.114
I just wish there had been another way.

00:57:05.114 --> 00:57:06.824
Third rule of the streets?

00:57:07.324 --> 00:57:08.576
Third rule?

00:57:08.576 --> 00:57:11.203
Some would say
it's the most important:

00:57:11.203 --> 00:57:14.832
No one is interested in your feelings.

00:57:16.584 --> 00:57:19.086
Chop-chop!
We have a Spirit Realm to plunder.

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.006
And smile.

00:57:22.006 --> 00:57:24.216
Nobody likes a grouch.

00:57:24.216 --> 00:57:27.845
Honestly, Zhen, I don't know where
you pick up such bad habits.

00:57:35.561 --> 00:57:36.562
If I could--

00:57:40.441 --> 00:57:41.400
Hey there.

00:57:42.193 --> 00:57:43.736
Whoa!

00:57:45.321 --> 00:57:47.781
Get off me! Ow! Ow!

00:57:52.995 --> 00:57:54.371
Son!

00:58:02.171 --> 00:58:04.590
- Now save me.

00:58:05.925 --> 00:58:06.926
Hi, Son.

00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:13.349
It's okay. We've got you, Po.
We've got you.

00:58:15.726 --> 00:58:17.102
So you followed me.

00:58:17.102 --> 00:58:18.479
- It was his idea.

00:58:18.479 --> 00:58:20.439
Okay, okay. It was both our ideas.

00:58:20.439 --> 00:58:22.608
We only follow because we love.

00:58:22.608 --> 00:58:25.569
No, you followed
because you didn't believe in me.

00:58:26.779 --> 00:58:27.905
And because we love?

00:58:29.073 --> 00:58:31.075
Well, you're right.

00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:33.536
I screwed up big-time.

00:58:34.411 --> 00:58:36.247
I trusted the wrong person.

00:58:36.247 --> 00:58:38.832
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

00:58:40.501 --> 00:58:41.502
Oh...

00:58:42.211 --> 00:58:46.840
Po, that was a very big-time screw-up.

00:58:49.677 --> 00:58:53.222
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace,

00:58:53.222 --> 00:58:56.809
The Chameleon wouldn't have my staff,
and none of this would be happening.

00:58:56.809 --> 00:58:59.770
I was just so determined
to keep things the way they were.

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:02.940
Everyone is afraid of change, Po.

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.567
Even me.

00:59:04.567 --> 00:59:07.444
There was a time not so long ago

00:59:07.444 --> 00:59:12.366
when all I wanted to be was
the greatest noodle chef in the valley.

00:59:12.366 --> 00:59:13.826
So what happened?

00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:16.912
I became the greatest noodle chef
in the valley.

00:59:16.912 --> 00:59:18.038
It's true.

00:59:18.038 --> 00:59:20.082
But I also became a father.

00:59:20.791 --> 00:59:23.919
And nothing...
nothing's ever been the same since.

00:59:25.045 --> 00:59:27.381
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

00:59:27.381 --> 00:59:30.968
Why do you think I always change
the menu at the restaurant?

00:59:32.595 --> 00:59:35.139
Because if things stayed the same forever,

00:59:35.139 --> 00:59:38.017
sooner or later,
they would lose their flavor.

00:59:39.643 --> 00:59:40.769
He's right, Po.

00:59:40.769 --> 00:59:44.064
Since I left my village,
I've become a bit of a warrior.

00:59:44.064 --> 00:59:45.983
- Strong. Brave.

00:59:47.401 --> 00:59:49.236
Move it.

00:59:49.236 --> 00:59:50.321
This way.

00:59:50.988 --> 00:59:53.657
Get those cages up there. Come on.

00:59:54.491 --> 00:59:56.577
Hmm. This looks bad.

00:59:56.577 --> 00:59:57.703
Really bad.

00:59:57.703 --> 00:59:58.787
Move it.

00:59:58.787 --> 01:00:00.706
Come on.

01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:10.174
Don't tell me you were actually starting
to become friends with that panda.

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:12.801
What? No. It's-It's just--

01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:16.555
When we want something, we must use
whatever is at our disposal to get it.

01:00:16.555 --> 01:00:19.808
That's all that panda was,
something to use.

01:00:21.477 --> 01:00:26.190
Is that why you took me in?
So I could help you get what you wanted?

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:27.608
Zhen.

01:00:27.608 --> 01:00:32.071
I took you in because you were clever
and ruthless and unsentimental,

01:00:32.071 --> 01:00:33.155
like me.

01:00:33.155 --> 01:00:35.533
And the day you stop being those things

01:00:35.533 --> 01:00:39.912
is the day when, yes,
you stop being useful to me.

01:00:39.912 --> 01:00:43.499
So for both of our sakes,
don't change.

01:00:49.755 --> 01:00:55.636
Tonight, when the blood moon rises
to its highest point in the night sky,

01:00:55.636 --> 01:01:01.559
I will open the door to the Spirit Realm,
and all of its secrets will be mine!

01:01:07.773 --> 01:01:10.067
Does the blood moon
always rise this slowly?

01:01:12.152 --> 01:01:14.572
I seem to remember it rising faster.

01:01:16.282 --> 01:01:17.575
No?

01:01:17.575 --> 01:01:18.659
Just me?

01:01:19.827 --> 01:01:20.828
Hmm.

01:01:22.955 --> 01:01:24.123
Ugh.

01:01:24.123 --> 01:01:26.292
It's just for dramatic effect anyway.

01:01:26.292 --> 01:01:29.253
I think I'm just gonna
open the Spirit Realm now.

01:01:41.223 --> 01:01:42.892
Bring me Tai Lung!

01:01:53.152 --> 01:01:54.153
Tai Lung.

01:01:55.237 --> 01:01:56.238
Big fan.

01:01:56.238 --> 01:01:59.116
Who are you,
and what are you doing with that staff?

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:02.244
This was given to me
by an old friend of yours.

01:02:02.244 --> 01:02:03.746
The puffy panda?

01:02:03.746 --> 01:02:05.206
Po might be an idiot,

01:02:05.206 --> 01:02:09.168
but he'd never willingly hand over
Oogway's staff to the likes of you.

01:02:09.168 --> 01:02:11.545
Who said anything about willingly?

01:02:20.429 --> 01:02:24.808
Hmm. Apparently I misjudged you, lizard.

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:27.311
Now, why have you brought me back?

01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:29.480
I summoned you here
so that you could teach me

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.565
your most legendary kung fu moves.

01:02:31.565 --> 01:02:34.693
I don't share my skills with anyone.

01:02:34.693 --> 01:02:36.403
It wasn't a request.

01:03:27.454 --> 01:03:29.456
Yes, I got it!

01:03:29.456 --> 01:03:31.542
The Tai Lung nerve strike.

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:33.711
The power, the precision.

01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:39.592
What have you done to me?

01:03:39.592 --> 01:03:43.178
All of your kung fu is now mine.

01:03:44.096 --> 01:03:48.559
And the best part is,
I'm just getting warmed up.

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.936
Bring me General Kai.

01:03:53.522 --> 01:03:57.276
Bring me Master Osprey.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.530
Master Bull.

01:04:08.204 --> 01:04:09.288
Po, wait!

01:04:09.288 --> 01:04:11.582
Please be reasonable.

01:04:11.582 --> 01:04:13.792
I'm not going anywhere
until I get my staff back.

01:04:13.792 --> 01:04:15.878
No staff is worth your life.

01:04:15.878 --> 01:04:18.297
As long as I'm still the Dragon Warrior,

01:04:18.297 --> 01:04:20.925
I won't let anyone else get hurt
because of me.

01:04:37.858 --> 01:04:38.817
Po!

01:04:39.777 --> 01:04:40.903
You're alive!

01:04:43.864 --> 01:04:46.033
Please. I made a mistake.

01:04:46.033 --> 01:04:48.911
So did I. Trusting you.

01:04:49.495 --> 01:04:50.454
I'm sorry.

01:04:51.038 --> 01:04:52.873
Did your master tell you
to say that too?

01:04:52.873 --> 01:04:56.085
She's not my master.
I'm leaving, for good.

01:04:56.919 --> 01:04:58.212
It's the truth.

01:04:58.212 --> 01:05:00.297
I was wrong about everything.

01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:04.009
- What are you doing?

01:05:04.009 --> 01:05:05.636
Stopping you.

01:05:05.636 --> 01:05:07.513
Get out of my way, Zhen.

01:05:07.513 --> 01:05:08.764
No.

01:05:09.557 --> 01:05:10.474
Move.

01:05:10.474 --> 01:05:12.226
You want me to move?

01:05:12.226 --> 01:05:13.519
Move me.

01:05:13.519 --> 01:05:16.105
First you betray me,
and now you wanna fight me?

01:05:17.231 --> 01:05:18.691
- Why are you doing this?

01:05:18.691 --> 01:05:21.694
To stop you from getting killed.

01:05:49.722 --> 01:05:51.891
What do you care
if I get killed or not?

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.366
Please, Po.

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:11.577
Just let me do one thing right.

01:06:16.749 --> 01:06:19.585
You're not the only one
who's made some bad choices lately.

01:06:21.587 --> 01:06:23.714
You're really gonna
go through with this, aren't you?

01:06:23.714 --> 01:06:24.840
'Fraid so.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.760
And there's nothing I can do
to talk you out of it?

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.928
I'm afraid not.

01:06:28.928 --> 01:06:30.930
You can't beat her, you know.

01:06:30.930 --> 01:06:32.514
You're probably right.

01:06:33.974 --> 01:06:35.392
But I have to try.

01:06:37.019 --> 01:06:38.979
Get as far away from this place
as you can.

01:06:38.979 --> 01:06:40.064
Po!

01:06:40.064 --> 01:06:42.274
We should never have
let him come here.

01:06:42.274 --> 01:06:44.527
We are such terrible fathers.

01:06:44.527 --> 01:06:46.445
At least you didn't lie and betray him.

01:06:46.445 --> 01:06:48.864
Well, that's true.
You're worse.

01:06:48.864 --> 01:06:50.783
I am a terrible friend.

01:06:50.783 --> 01:06:53.494
"Friend"?
That feels a little generous, no?

01:06:53.494 --> 01:06:55.704
Uh, l-let's just give up.
Surrender.

01:06:55.704 --> 01:06:57.373
We can't let him go in there alone.

01:06:57.373 --> 01:06:58.958
What can we do?

01:06:58.958 --> 01:07:01.418
There are just three of us
against an army.

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:04.213
Then I guess we'll just have to
get an army of our own.

01:07:17.226 --> 01:07:19.103
Hey! Listen up, everybody!

01:07:22.898 --> 01:07:25.526
Quack!

01:07:27.903 --> 01:07:29.154
Thank you.

01:07:29.154 --> 01:07:31.240
The Dragon Warrior's in trouble.

01:07:32.157 --> 01:07:34.243
- Who?
- You know, Po.

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:36.871
The panda.

01:07:39.915 --> 01:07:42.001
No, no. A different panda.

01:07:42.001 --> 01:07:44.211
- I'm his father.
- I'm also his father.

01:07:44.962 --> 01:07:46.130
Okay, that doesn't matter.

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:49.800
What matters is that my friend's
in trouble and he needs my help.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.760
So, I need yours.

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.596
Why should we help you?

01:07:53.596 --> 01:07:54.930
Because--

01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:56.015
Because...

01:07:56.891 --> 01:07:58.434
it's the right thing to do.

01:08:02.771 --> 01:08:04.732
Stop it. Stop.

01:08:04.732 --> 01:08:06.066
Stop laughing.

01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:09.695
Look, I know you think
it might be too late

01:08:09.695 --> 01:08:14.450
for a bunch of cheats, thieves and
cutthroats like us to change our ways,

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:19.537
but a good friend once told me
it's never too late to do the right thing.

01:08:19.537 --> 01:08:23.082
So what you're saying is,
the more right we do now,

01:08:23.082 --> 01:08:25.126
the more wrong we can do later.

01:08:25.126 --> 01:08:26.336
- What? No.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:28.881
And with The Chameleon out of the way...

01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:31.091
We can finally do all the wrong we want.

01:08:31.091 --> 01:08:33.135
I-I think you're missing
the fundamental point.

01:08:33.135 --> 01:08:35.763
Violence, violence, violence.

01:08:35.763 --> 01:08:39.600
Are you guys ready to do the right thing
for the wrong reasons?

01:08:44.647 --> 01:08:47.191
Now, you see, this mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made

01:08:47.191 --> 01:08:48.984
was underestimating his opponent.

01:08:48.984 --> 01:08:51.946
I never would have walked
into such an obvious trap.

01:08:51.946 --> 01:08:53.447
Hey.

01:08:56.033 --> 01:08:58.702
Now, you see, the mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made was that--

01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:00.371
Shut up, Larry.

01:09:05.042 --> 01:09:07.419
This place is crawling
with more guards than I've ever seen.

01:09:07.419 --> 01:09:09.505
I'm never gonna get to Po in time.

01:09:09.505 --> 01:09:12.299
You just get to Po.
We'll take care of the guards.

01:09:12.299 --> 01:09:13.676
We will?

01:09:13.676 --> 01:09:15.176
I-I mean, we will.

01:09:15.176 --> 01:09:16.387
But how?

01:09:16.887 --> 01:09:18.555
Just leave that to me.

01:09:49.795 --> 01:09:51.255
General Kai?

01:09:52.006 --> 01:09:53.256
Lord Shen?

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:57.219
Those are all my old nemesis-es.
Nemes-ee. Nemes-i?

01:09:57.219 --> 01:10:00.264
The Chameleon is pulling spirits
from the Spirit Realm

01:10:00.264 --> 01:10:02.308
and draining us of all our moves.

01:10:02.308 --> 01:10:05.144
And she's using your staff to do it.

01:10:05.144 --> 01:10:07.146
- I'm here to get it back.

01:10:07.146 --> 01:10:08.647
I won't hold my breath.

01:10:08.647 --> 01:10:10.191
Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?

01:10:10.191 --> 01:10:11.984
Do you know me? It's Scott.

01:10:13.777 --> 01:10:15.738
The fire-breathing crocodile?

01:10:15.738 --> 01:10:18.824
Oh, right! Scott!

01:10:18.824 --> 01:10:21.118
Master Shifu and I
were just talking about you.

01:10:21.118 --> 01:10:22.578
Panda.

01:10:23.204 --> 01:10:26.957
Oogway made a mistake
choosing you as the Dragon Warrior.

01:10:28.083 --> 01:10:32.213
I just didn't realize
how big a mistake it was until now.

01:10:32.213 --> 01:10:34.757
Whoa. Tai Lung?

01:10:34.757 --> 01:10:38.302
I'm gonna get that staff back,
restore your kung fu,

01:10:38.302 --> 01:10:40.763
and return you all
back to the Spirit Realm.

01:10:40.763 --> 01:10:42.097
You'll see.

01:10:42.097 --> 01:10:43.432
All I see

01:10:44.266 --> 01:10:46.185
is a broken promise.

01:10:51.315 --> 01:10:55.819
All right, you bunch of
cantankerous Komodos.

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:59.114
Now, this can go one of two ways.

01:10:59.114 --> 01:11:02.910
The easy way,
in which you surrender willingly,

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:07.039
or the hard way,
where you surrender woundedly.

01:11:07.039 --> 01:11:09.833
The choice is yours.

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:16.090
- I was kidding! I was kidding!

01:11:25.015 --> 01:11:26.016
Aw.

01:11:28.227 --> 01:11:29.770
- Ow! Ow!

01:11:32.106 --> 01:11:33.107
Thanks, Ping.

01:11:37.444 --> 01:11:38.571
Run away!

01:11:42.825 --> 01:11:45.661
Cannonball!

01:11:54.128 --> 01:11:55.337
- Oh, is it too spicy?

01:11:55.337 --> 01:11:58.090
Mmm. No. It's got the perfect kick.

01:11:58.090 --> 01:12:01.343
Ginseng. That's the secret
to my mulberry punch.

01:12:08.309 --> 01:12:11.562
That panda was right.
More violence later is better!

01:12:12.187 --> 01:12:13.522
Yay!

01:12:19.486 --> 01:12:22.072
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

01:12:25.451 --> 01:12:27.620
Can't you even die right?

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.580
Can't you even kill wrong?

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.916
No.
Wordplay didn't come together.

01:12:31.916 --> 01:12:33.250
Now, about that staff...

01:12:35.628 --> 01:12:36.629
Take it.

01:12:36.629 --> 01:12:39.298
I already have everything I need
from it anyway.

01:12:39.882 --> 01:12:42.092
I think this was destiny.

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:46.597
A final face-off
between formidable adversaries,

01:12:46.597 --> 01:12:49.433
alike in so many ways.

01:12:49.433 --> 01:12:51.060
If only I had a dumpling for every time

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.978
a villain told me
how much we had in common.

01:12:52.978 --> 01:12:54.063
It's true.

01:12:54.063 --> 01:12:56.398
We've both risen
to the highest of heights.

01:12:56.398 --> 01:12:59.527
It's a shame only one of us can
come out on top.

01:12:59.527 --> 01:13:02.154
It is a shame, for you.

01:13:02.154 --> 01:13:07.117
My combined powers of sorcery and kung fu
make me unstoppable.

01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:11.580
And once I dispense with you,
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City to--

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:13.374
Every other city and town and village

01:13:13.374 --> 01:13:15.125
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond.

01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:16.335
Yeah, I know.

01:13:16.335 --> 01:13:18.420
But how did you know?

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:22.383
I saw it in a vision
because I'm the Dragon Warrior...

01:13:24.552 --> 01:13:25.886
for now at least.

01:13:25.886 --> 01:13:29.473
But I've realized
that it's probably time I made a change.

01:13:30.558 --> 01:13:31.976
And so should you.

01:13:31.976 --> 01:13:34.853
I'm The Chameleon.
I do nothing but change.

01:13:34.853 --> 01:13:36.689
Only on the outside.

01:13:36.689 --> 01:13:39.441
Real change happens from within.

01:13:39.441 --> 01:13:41.902
And if we're really as alike as you say,

01:13:41.902 --> 01:13:43.946
then maybe we could both let go
of who we were

01:13:43.946 --> 01:13:46.365
and become something better
than we already are.

01:13:47.157 --> 01:13:49.660
- What do you say?
- I say...

01:13:52.246 --> 01:13:53.747
Well, I saw that coming.

01:13:56.041 --> 01:13:57.751
We're very proud of you.

01:13:57.751 --> 01:13:58.961
You tried it our way.

01:13:58.961 --> 01:14:01.088
Now try it yours.

01:14:01.088 --> 01:14:03.340
Kick her butt.

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:05.259
I'm way ahead of you.

01:14:13.309 --> 01:14:15.477
Master Elephant's Trunk Twist.

01:14:18.856 --> 01:14:20.774
Master Boar's Tusks of Terror.

01:14:21.859 --> 01:14:23.861
Master Wolf's Fangs of Fury.

01:14:28.908 --> 01:14:30.868
Master Bull's Horns of Doom.

01:14:33.287 --> 01:14:34.496
What?

01:14:34.496 --> 01:14:35.831
Recognize this move?

01:14:38.459 --> 01:14:41.170
Is that how I sound?
I don't sound like that, do I?

01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:44.423
You didn't earn those skills.
You just stole them!

01:14:45.507 --> 01:14:47.092
Give him a left, a right, uppercut.

01:14:47.092 --> 01:14:50.679
- Which one are you rooting for?
- I'm not sure. This is all very confusing.

01:14:50.679 --> 01:14:53.432
I'm stronger than every opponent
you've ever faced,

01:14:53.432 --> 01:14:56.852
because I am every opponent
you've ever faced.

01:14:56.852 --> 01:14:57.770
Po!

01:15:10.407 --> 01:15:13.202
Whoa. I gotta workshop
those heroic entrances.

01:15:13.202 --> 01:15:15.496
Nah, it was just right.

01:15:17.331 --> 01:15:20.668
I knew I should have left you
to rot in the gutter where you belong.

01:15:20.668 --> 01:15:23.295
Better to rot in the gutter
than under your thumb.

01:15:31.387 --> 01:15:33.305
- Two against one?

01:15:33.305 --> 01:15:35.516
Well, now, that doesn't seem fair.

01:15:35.516 --> 01:15:37.685
I'll have to even the odds.

01:15:38.894 --> 01:15:40.563
Master Cobra.

01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:43.315
Master Osprey.

01:15:43.315 --> 01:15:45.359
Master Scorpion.

01:15:45.359 --> 01:15:47.403
Master Wolf.

01:15:47.403 --> 01:15:49.864
General Kai.

01:15:49.864 --> 01:15:51.156
Lord Shen.

01:15:55.369 --> 01:15:58.414
That is awesome!

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.542
I mean, it's disturbing, but it's awesome.

01:16:18.934 --> 01:16:19.768
Whoa!

01:16:20.686 --> 01:16:22.187
Zhen!

01:16:34.575 --> 01:16:36.619
No!

01:16:43.042 --> 01:16:44.293
Whoa, whoa!

01:16:56.847 --> 01:16:58.098
Po!

01:17:04.939 --> 01:17:06.607
I thought we were friends.

01:17:08.484 --> 01:17:09.568
Stand back.

01:17:09.568 --> 01:17:11.904
I'm gonna kick my butt.

01:18:34.653 --> 01:18:35.946
Come on, Po, get out of there.

01:18:35.946 --> 01:18:38.407
- You have to do this.
- I can't beat The Chameleon.

01:18:38.407 --> 01:18:40.034
A wise, old tortoise once told me

01:18:40.034 --> 01:18:42.286
that you never know what you can do
until you do it.

01:18:42.286 --> 01:18:44.455
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance,

01:18:44.455 --> 01:18:47.041
and you're here giving me life advice
from a tortoise?

01:18:47.041 --> 01:18:48.626
Be the pit, Zhen.

01:18:49.251 --> 01:18:50.961
Be the pit.

01:19:00.721 --> 01:19:02.389
And what do you think you're doing?

01:19:02.389 --> 01:19:04.141
Finishing what Po started.

01:19:04.141 --> 01:19:07.019
Oh, please. How many times
do I have to tell you?

01:19:09.021 --> 01:19:10.439
Don't slouch.

01:19:20.449 --> 01:19:22.743
You ungrateful little urchin.

01:19:22.743 --> 01:19:26.914
After all I've done for you,
you betrayed me for the panda?

01:19:27.915 --> 01:19:31.669
First rule
of the streets: Never trust anyone.

01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:35.089
Ha! You can't defeat me.
I know all your moves.

01:19:35.089 --> 01:19:36.674
Not this one.

01:19:36.674 --> 01:19:40.302
Roll, stir, serve,

01:19:40.302 --> 01:19:42.429
and ska-blam!

01:19:47.142 --> 01:19:50.020
Yes!

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:53.315
Second rule: Someone always gets hurt.

01:19:53.941 --> 01:19:55.568
Now, that's a cool move.

01:19:55.568 --> 01:19:58.404
Po! You could have gotten out of that cage
anytime you wanted?

01:19:58.404 --> 01:19:59.572
You faker.

01:19:59.572 --> 01:20:01.657
It's not faking. It's Method.

01:20:01.657 --> 01:20:04.869
Besides, how's a peach pit
ever supposed to become a tree

01:20:04.869 --> 01:20:07.663
if you never give it
the chance to grow?

01:20:09.915 --> 01:20:12.751
And, hey, you stirred faster
and rolled higher.

01:20:12.751 --> 01:20:15.754
But for the last time, the word is...

01:20:22.887 --> 01:20:24.013
..."skadoosh."

01:20:49.788 --> 01:20:52.499
Maybe Oogway was right about you.

01:20:55.252 --> 01:20:57.588
You aren't completely useless after all.

01:20:58.464 --> 01:21:00.007
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much.

01:21:10.434 --> 01:21:12.895
That's my son.

01:21:12.895 --> 01:21:14.063
Our son.

01:21:15.105 --> 01:21:19.276
I think it's time you send us home, panda.

01:21:53.686 --> 01:21:56.063
Zhen, do something!

01:21:56.063 --> 01:21:59.859
Third rule:
No one's interested in your feelings.

01:22:04.947 --> 01:22:08.951
See you on the other side, Dragon Warrior.

01:22:31.432 --> 01:22:33.601
We packed some food
for your time in jail.

01:22:33.601 --> 01:22:36.395
Let's hope it's not
your final meal.

01:22:36.395 --> 01:22:37.938
Thanks, guys.

01:22:38.814 --> 01:22:43.527
I was thinking, after I serve my time
and I'm a free fox again,

01:22:43.527 --> 01:22:46.363
maybe I'll open one of those
acupuncture places that are all the rage.

01:22:46.363 --> 01:22:51.202
I think you're better suited for a job
with a little more room for growth.

01:22:55.039 --> 01:22:56.040
Jade Palace?

01:22:57.875 --> 01:22:59.627
Her?

01:22:59.627 --> 01:23:03.505
Out of all the candidates you choose
to train as your worthy successor,

01:23:03.505 --> 01:23:05.216
you chose the fox?

01:23:05.216 --> 01:23:07.301
You know when you know,
you know?

01:23:07.301 --> 01:23:09.929
Fine, choose who you want.
A thief, a stick, a carrot.

01:23:09.929 --> 01:23:11.722
I don't even know why I bother.

01:23:11.722 --> 01:23:14.558
I'm going to go meditate... a lot.

01:23:17.019 --> 01:23:18.896
Don't worry. He'll come around.

01:23:19.563 --> 01:23:21.565
Probably. Maybe.

01:23:23.359 --> 01:23:24.944
Hey, you okay?

01:23:26.904 --> 01:23:29.615
He's right.
What about me says I'm ready for this?

01:23:30.824 --> 01:23:33.118
Well, as I learned
from working in my dad's kitchen,

01:23:33.118 --> 01:23:37.706
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

01:23:37.706 --> 01:23:39.792
Hey, that's not bad.

01:23:39.792 --> 01:23:41.627
Okay, I see you, Spiritual Leader.

01:23:41.627 --> 01:23:44.463
Yeah. I'm getting the hang of
this proverb thing.

01:23:44.463 --> 01:23:47.591
One shouldn't do a deep squat
with a chopstick in one's pocket.

01:23:47.591 --> 01:23:49.593
Maybe you should
just stick to kicking butt.

01:23:49.593 --> 01:23:53.472
Money can't buy happiness,
but it sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

01:23:53.472 --> 01:23:55.808
Why does it always come back
to dumplings with you?

01:23:55.808 --> 01:24:00.563
When life gives you lemons,
make pear juice and blow everyone's minds.

01:24:00.563 --> 01:24:01.647
We get it.

01:24:01.647 --> 01:24:04.567
You can't have your mooncake
and eat it too.

01:24:05.150 --> 01:24:08.404
Although, I guess you could have mooncake
and then order mango pudding on the side.

01:24:08.404 --> 01:24:10.322
Can we just start the training now?

01:24:12.908 --> 01:24:14.326
Inner peace.

01:24:15.202 --> 01:24:16.662
Inner peace.

01:24:17.454 --> 01:24:18.747
Inner peace.

01:24:18.747 --> 01:24:19.832
Hey, Master Shifu.

01:24:19.832 --> 01:24:20.916
Look, there's two of us.

01:24:20.916 --> 01:24:23.043
- You're doing great, Shifu.
- You're not breathing with your belly.

01:24:23.043 --> 01:24:24.879
- You look a little tired.
- Are you tired?

01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:28.841
- You do look like a squirrel.
- Do you want a cookie?

01:24:33.596 --> 01:24:35.264
Inner peace.

01:24:36.682 --> 01:24:38.142
Inner peace.

01:24:39.518 --> 01:24:41.312
Inner peace.

01:24:49.778 --> 01:24:51.572
Are you ready to begin your training?

01:24:52.156 --> 01:24:53.407
Are you?

01:24:53.407 --> 01:24:55.993
Yes, and I brought a little help.
