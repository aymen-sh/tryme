00:00.450 --> 00:08.760
And so, we Miburo set out to fight the Blood
 Risshidan, who wanted to set the city ablaze.

00:10.330 --> 00:12.380
Who does Kondo Isami fight?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.520
I wanna hear what Okita Soji does.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.190
What about Hijikata Toshizo?

00:17.520 --> 00:19.950
No one cares what <i>I</i> did?

00:20.080 --> 00:23.280
Wait, you fought, too, Old Man Shinpachi?

00:23.280 --> 00:27.290
Yes. If not for the battle that night,

00:27.560 --> 00:33.260
I might not be living 
as a samurai should now.

00:33.790 --> 00:35.240
Sounds awesome.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.510
I can't wait to hear 
what happens next, Sensei!

00:39.520 --> 00:44.890
It was a windy, moonless night.

02:23.300 --> 02:27.180
So you're worried about this 
Nagi-san lady who has a bun in the oven,

02:27.180 --> 02:28.760
and you want to go check on her?

02:29.010 --> 02:32.950
Well, purely in terms of how I feel, 
that's what it boils down to, yeah.

02:33.260 --> 02:34.220
Okay!

02:34.220 --> 02:36.770
Forget the nitty-gritty. Let's go, Nio-kun!

02:36.770 --> 02:38.660
Th-Thank you.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.600
Talk about simple. Is that lady okay?

02:42.360 --> 02:43.880
Heisuke! Soji!

02:44.200 --> 02:45.950
We ain't got swords.

02:45.950 --> 02:48.140
Lend us something! We'll settle for daggers!

02:48.320 --> 02:49.280
Please!

02:49.280 --> 02:50.690
Wh-Why?

02:51.010 --> 02:56.050
Oh, right. You pawned your swords 
and lost the money gambling.

02:56.570 --> 02:57.790
Guess we have no choice.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.120
I owe you one.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.400
You'd better return it!

03:01.400 --> 03:02.810
All right, all right.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.370
They wanna set Kyoto on fire?
What a bunch of showoffs.

03:07.370 --> 03:09.870
We'll show 'em what the Miburo are made of.

03:10.030 --> 03:12.040
Stay on your toes, Yamanami.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.880
I don't need you to tell me that.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.430
I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!

03:18.430 --> 03:19.720
Shut up.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.800
It's the second bridge after the corner.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.960
I know.

03:23.180 --> 03:25.230
Noguchi, you're with me.

03:25.230 --> 03:26.440
Don't fall behind.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.400
Y-Yes, sir! Sorry!

03:40.310 --> 03:42.120
This wind is a problem.

03:42.750 --> 03:46.500
If they start a fire on this side of 
the bridges, it'll spread in a flash.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.460
Look.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.680
The Sanjo Bridge!

03:52.100 --> 03:53.120
Smoke signals!

03:53.120 --> 03:54.760
They're going up all over the place!

03:55.240 --> 03:56.640
Here they come!

03:56.640 --> 03:57.590
Spread out!

03:57.880 --> 03:58.880
Yeah!

04:16.060 --> 04:19.380

05:04.320 --> 05:05.950
Out of my way.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.430
Congratulations. You hit the jackpot.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.160
Naozumi-san!

05:17.290 --> 05:19.340
So <i>you're</i> the boss of these rebels!

05:19.580 --> 05:21.430
Serizawa-san, we're counting on you.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.320
Who do you think you're talking to?

05:28.320 --> 05:29.340
Go.

05:32.470 --> 05:33.680
<i>That sword looks like...</i>

05:36.100 --> 05:38.100
Don't stop! Run!

05:40.100 --> 05:42.850
B-Break through! Break through!

05:43.320 --> 05:44.430
Those little...

05:44.430 --> 05:45.520
Who cares?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.350
Ignore them.

05:55.810 --> 05:58.270
That scruffy guy could be bad news.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.000
Huh?

06:04.880 --> 06:07.260
I've got myself good steel.

06:10.600 --> 06:14.010
I'd know that silver sheath anywhere.
 My master made it.

06:14.530 --> 06:16.480
It's a one-of-a-kind long sword.

06:17.490 --> 06:20.520
The black blade, Tsugumori.

06:33.040 --> 06:38.450
It's hard to follow that blade with your eyes,
 and the new moon only makes it harder.

06:38.590 --> 06:42.710
Wh-What the hell? How do you 
block something you can't see?

06:43.120 --> 06:45.670
I can't believe anyone 
can use that heavy thing.

06:51.340 --> 06:52.650
F-Fall back!

06:52.650 --> 06:53.880
He'll hit us, too!

06:54.880 --> 06:58.800
Serizawa Kamo, right? You're famous.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.550
Oh?

07:03.920 --> 07:07.780
The toughest braggart in Mito. 
The Miburo's biggest star.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.790
But you're a walking contradiction.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.010
What?

07:12.720 --> 07:17.280
You trampled anyone in your way. 
You crushed vested interests.

07:17.580 --> 07:21.290
You were leading the anti-barbarian charge.

07:23.950 --> 07:28.440
And look at you now. You're the 
polar opposite. A shogunate lapdog.

07:34.310 --> 07:36.970
Clearing the way for your comrades?

07:37.400 --> 07:39.320
Saving the weak?

07:40.700 --> 07:44.980
What leg does your "justice"
 have to stand on?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.830
He... He blocked it.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.580
No way. Does that mean 
he can see that blade?

07:54.440 --> 07:56.590
What does it stand on?

07:57.830 --> 07:59.880
You've got it all wrong.

08:00.720 --> 08:05.240
What's right changes whenever 
I shift where <i>I'm</i> standing.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.140
Don't worry.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.480
Huh?

08:16.530 --> 08:17.890
Serizawa-san will not fall.

08:18.420 --> 08:23.320
Right now, Serizawa Kamo 
and his Mibu Roshigumi...

08:23.940 --> 08:28.310
are the sole arbiters of justice.

08:28.900 --> 08:31.910

08:34.740 --> 08:37.670

08:37.670 --> 08:39.330
Don't get it mixed up.

08:39.330 --> 08:40.870
I know that.

08:40.870 --> 08:43.660
You keep your eyes peeled, Sanosuke.

08:44.370 --> 08:47.110
Can we really count on you guys?

08:47.110 --> 08:48.880
Hirama and Hirayama!

08:48.880 --> 08:52.700
Only a real blockhead loses his sword 
just before an emergency.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.430
You're the Miburo's resident nincompoops!

08:54.430 --> 08:59.140
Shove it! You're just Serizawa's lackeys!

08:59.140 --> 09:01.390
That's right! Mind your own business!

09:07.040 --> 09:08.640
Excuse us. So sorry.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.640
Excuse us!

09:09.200 --> 09:11.240
Our bridge is farther ahead!

09:11.530 --> 09:12.900
Best of luck!

09:13.320 --> 09:15.600
Those guys can really move.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.600
Don't screw up, you hear?

09:17.760 --> 09:19.830
Shut up! Same to you!

09:29.210 --> 09:30.820
This is it. Nijo Bridge.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.040
You must be Miburo!

09:36.440 --> 09:37.680
Stay out of our way!

09:37.880 --> 09:40.770
One, two, three of 'em.

09:41.070 --> 09:42.930
I expected more.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.750
Hey, look. They don't have real swords.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.990
You're right. They only have wakizashi.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.200
I thought they were samurai.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.900
Let's decide who handles this.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.440
Yes, I agree.

10:00.970 --> 10:01.550
Tails.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.440
Too bad. It's heads.

10:05.380 --> 10:06.380
I see.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.680
Which one's heads?

10:10.680 --> 10:13.130
How should <i>I</i> know? 
Decide that before you flip it!

10:13.470 --> 10:16.060
And isn't that the money Nio and Taro made?

10:16.060 --> 10:17.610
I... I only borrowed it.

10:17.950 --> 10:22.030
You never change. Always leaving 
things to chance and failing.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.640
You didn't think so 
when you agreed to join me!

10:25.080 --> 10:26.510
That's enough out of you clowns!

10:32.400 --> 10:34.240
You'll pay for that!

10:38.580 --> 10:39.500
Whoops.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.780
All bark and no bite.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.860
They should've trained harder.

11:02.230 --> 11:04.120
Sanosuke! You're on fire!

11:06.220 --> 11:07.470
Hurry up and put it out!

11:11.240 --> 11:12.600
That was a close one.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.260
You let your guard down too soon.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.760
Well done.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.760
Are you the boss here?

11:20.630 --> 11:21.570
I know you!

11:25.600 --> 11:28.820
I hoped you wouldn't come.

11:29.250 --> 11:32.720
No, honestly, I hoped you would.

11:32.940 --> 11:34.450
The old guy from the gambling hall!

11:34.750 --> 11:37.880
This goes beyond bad luck. It's fate.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.960
You're in the Risshidan?

11:40.960 --> 11:44.720
I-I had no idea. You acted all buddy-buddy.

11:44.930 --> 11:47.500
I'd heard you were Miburo,

11:47.870 --> 11:50.910
but I didn't know we were 
to become enemies, either.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.950
We had a great time chatting with you.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.380
Why would you make us fight you now?

11:57.510 --> 11:59.870
We even drank together!

12:05.820 --> 12:08.410
Now, who wants to be first?

12:08.880 --> 12:11.400
Or I can take you both at once, if you'd rather.

12:12.020 --> 12:12.760

My ancestor was Kudo Suketsune, 
a Heian samurai.

13:17.610 --> 13:19.980
I have a real warrior pedigree.

13:21.100 --> 13:27.840
But I was nothing but a lesser samurai, 
growing rice in the northeast.

13:34.460 --> 13:38.000
A samurai killed my son and grandson.

13:39.710 --> 13:43.000
I assumed he'd be ordered to slit his belly,

13:44.330 --> 13:50.850
but he got off with the slap on the wrist 
that is exile because he'd "avenged an insult."

13:52.510 --> 13:55.940
I left my homeland to seek revenge.

13:58.340 --> 13:59.730
And what did I see?

14:01.080 --> 14:06.110
Scoundrels who pulled old priests 
off the road to test their blades.

14:07.450 --> 14:12.370
Animals who'd stop at nothing
 to sate their lusts.

14:13.490 --> 14:14.730
Vulgar grins.

14:15.090 --> 14:17.710
The reality of samurai in name only.

14:18.730 --> 14:22.860
The likes of them make the weak suffer.

14:24.690 --> 14:26.430
So I decided to get rid of them all.

14:27.890 --> 14:29.480
To exterminate them.

14:34.600 --> 14:40.180
I honed my skills to send as many 
samurai to hell as I possibly could.

14:41.050 --> 14:44.570
I was a bodyguard by day,
 an assassin by night.

14:45.610 --> 14:50.400
I chose as best I could and
 killed more than twenty men.

14:51.920 --> 14:55.270
I felt satisfied, but I didn't smile.

14:56.840 --> 15:03.950
For each one I killed, a sliver of guilt 
built up in me like silt in a river.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.710
And then, I met that man.

15:09.810 --> 15:12.530
Don't blame yourself, old-timer.

15:13.030 --> 15:15.970
I knew at a glance that he was different.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.090
Blame the times.

15:19.590 --> 15:21.880
Haven't you ever thought of changing them?

15:24.360 --> 15:27.640
He speaks in anachronisms.

15:28.260 --> 15:32.500
Maybe it's nothing but 
daydreams and crazy talk.

15:33.340 --> 15:38.700
But if the alternative is wasting away 
without ever setting foot on a battlefield,

15:39.030 --> 15:42.200
then there's something 
to be said for his ravings.

15:44.290 --> 15:46.200
This old man's tough.

15:46.460 --> 15:48.880
No one at our dojo could even—

15:51.800 --> 15:56.120
I'm known as the Hound, 
and I hunt the beasts called samurai.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.310
Now, draw your weapons!

15:58.750 --> 16:01.340
Do it, if you're real samurai!

16:04.960 --> 16:05.880
Old man.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.520
Are you dead set on doing this?

16:08.760 --> 16:09.470
Of course.

16:10.450 --> 16:11.800
Oh, well.

16:13.050 --> 16:13.940
I understand.

16:17.090 --> 16:20.120
If you want my head, take it. It's yours.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.080
Hey!

16:23.080 --> 16:25.550
This is no time for jokes, Shinpachi!

16:25.930 --> 16:27.130
It's no joke.

16:27.840 --> 16:28.340
Whoa!

16:28.630 --> 16:29.500
Watch out!

16:31.680 --> 16:33.780
You almost ended up skewered!

16:33.780 --> 16:34.890
I don't mind.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.480
Well, <i>I</i> do!

16:36.670 --> 16:37.960
What are you playing at?

16:38.500 --> 16:41.730
You wish to avenge your son and grandson.

16:42.360 --> 16:47.730
But the shogunate forbids parents 
from avenging their children.

16:47.960 --> 16:51.960
Yes. That's why I left my domain and my home.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.940
But that was 30 long years ago.

16:56.520 --> 17:00.240
My target must be dead
 in some ditch by now.

17:00.490 --> 17:04.980
You resent the samurai 
and wish to kill as many as you can.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.640
I just told you that.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.880
But there are no samurai in the Miburo.

17:15.380 --> 17:19.890
Most of us are farmers or ronin. 
Some, I don't even know.

17:20.310 --> 17:25.390
But only Serizawa Kamo and I come 
from proper samurai lineages.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.050
I can bear your grudge.

17:29.370 --> 17:31.130
I can't kill you.

17:32.390 --> 17:35.410
What you're trying to do is wrong,

17:36.040 --> 17:38.560
but I understand your frustration.

17:39.200 --> 17:44.530
Would you take the head of 
Nagakura Shinpachi and leave it at that?

17:44.670 --> 17:46.870
Then you die first!

17:50.750 --> 17:52.780
What do you think you're doing, Sanosuke?

17:55.450 --> 17:56.400
Shut up.

17:59.630 --> 18:02.600
You've got rotten luck, old man.

18:02.750 --> 18:03.440
What?

18:03.760 --> 18:06.190
How many decades have you been at this?

18:06.600 --> 18:08.080
You've got no talent for it.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.790
You cocky brat!

18:15.360 --> 18:16.020
What?

18:17.890 --> 18:18.850
What did I tell you?

18:19.350 --> 18:20.890
I can see it all.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.720
People tell me I've got good eyes.

18:34.050 --> 18:35.990
I'm not a softy like Shinpachi.

18:36.810 --> 18:39.010
I don't care what your deal is.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.430
When it comes to killing, I won't hold back.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.490
Just kidding.

18:50.450 --> 18:54.920
I'm not bad with a sword, 
but this comes so much more natural.

18:59.330 --> 19:01.870
I've been rowdy since I was a kid.

19:02.370 --> 19:07.040
I acted out. I brawled. 
Basically, I never got along anywhere.

19:07.430 --> 19:09.450
But I've finally found...

19:10.190 --> 19:12.680
a place I can belong.

19:17.950 --> 19:20.370
What kind of group are you?

19:21.270 --> 19:24.580
Why do you grow your beards 
and wear your hair loose?

19:24.970 --> 19:28.180
Why not try to look the part of a samurai?

19:31.050 --> 19:32.190
Tell him.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.150
I don't like to share this,

19:37.040 --> 19:40.870
but I felt sensitive about 
being a samurai in the Miburo.

19:41.640 --> 19:46.100
Even when people don't mean 
to form cliques or put up walls,

19:46.100 --> 19:49.090
those on the outside have a way
 of feeling them anyway.

19:50.580 --> 19:54.740
I wanted to at least look 
the part of a ronin.

19:55.030 --> 19:56.210
And, well...

19:57.080 --> 20:00.460
I've started feeling like a fool 
since <i>he</i> joined up.

20:00.660 --> 20:01.440
"He"? Who?

20:01.680 --> 20:04.120
Oh, this kid from a dango shop.

20:05.190 --> 20:07.000
A child? From a dango shop?

20:07.320 --> 20:10.680
Indeed. He's awfully soft, you see.

20:11.620 --> 20:13.560
Not cut out for battle.

20:14.250 --> 20:17.480
But he still shows off, 
and he cries all the time.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.770
And he's stubborn, too, 
so he can be a real pain.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.640
He's so green and reckless that 
you can't take your eyes off him.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.410
Taro, pick up the pace!

20:25.130 --> 20:28.000
He's never at the center of things,

20:26.420 --> 20:28.000
You're slower than me!

20:28.360 --> 20:29.240
This way.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.000
but somehow, he brings everyone together.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.320
Yeah. And we've got an even brattier kid.

20:37.540 --> 20:38.710
A mini samurai.

20:39.160 --> 20:44.270
And a beggar boy we took in
 to help with odd jobs.

20:44.950 --> 20:48.770
We're outcasts, but the Miburo 
make us feel like we belong.

20:52.240 --> 20:56.320
Unlike you guys, we don't fuss 
over birth or breeding.

20:59.370 --> 21:03.650
You should've come to us instead, old man.

21:04.070 --> 21:05.520
I wish you had.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.320
I see. You may be right.

21:12.820 --> 21:15.310
Oh, hey! I know.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.920
I'll put in a good word for you 
if you switch sides.

21:18.320 --> 21:22.820
True. We're a gaggle of outdated swordsman.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.670
Those skills you've honed won't go to waste.

21:44.950 --> 21:49.950
<b>A
Place</b>

21:44.950 --> 21:49.950
<b>to 
Belong</b>

23:20.080 --> 23:25.460
<b>Next time</b>

23:22.840 --> 23:24.050
Hijikata Toshizo here.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.600
Nagakura and Sanosuke are fighting 
a formidable foe on another bridge.

23:29.610 --> 23:31.280
I can't afford to lose, either.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.110
The sword Sakura made for me 
is holding up well.

23:34.980 --> 23:39.140
No matter how skilled my enemies are,
I'll do things my way,

23:39.510 --> 23:41.740
and keep swinging my blade.

23:42.810 --> 23:44.790
Next time: "Man of the Soil."

23:45.520 --> 23:47.550
Watch. That is all.

23:47.110 --> 23:49.950
<b>Man
of</b>

23:47.110 --> 23:49.950
<b>the
Soil</b>
