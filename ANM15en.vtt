WEBVTT

00:00.440 --> 00:04.600
Well, well. Long time no see.

00:04.740 --> 00:08.470
So? Since you came to me, 
I'm guessing you want money?

00:10.230 --> 00:13.110
Who will you kill, Jiro?

00:13.710 --> 00:18.040
Or is it Saito Hajime II now?

00:20.180 --> 00:24.000
How does it feel to be called that name?

00:24.610 --> 00:27.600
Nothing special. I gave up 
my old one long ago.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.130
It means nothing to me.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.600
Oh, really?

00:31.020 --> 00:33.680
I don't believe that for a minute.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.010
A name is the first thing 
parents give their child.

00:39.730 --> 00:42.110
You're awful chatty for a snake.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.390
Temper, temper.

00:44.390 --> 00:47.640
Your patience is a far cry
 from your namesake's.

00:48.650 --> 00:51.850
The surliness hasn't changed, though.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.080
You must have gotten that from him.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.810
You want to talk work?

01:00.000 --> 01:00.660
That's right.

01:04.830 --> 01:11.960
<b>5 ryo</b>

01:04.830 --> 01:11.960
<b>10
ryo</b>

01:04.830 --> 01:11.960
<b>20 ryo</b>

01:04.830 --> 01:11.960

01:05.040 --> 01:07.220

Red Eye: 5 ryo.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.240
The Frog: 20 ryo.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.870
The Lady Bandit: 30 ryo.

01:13.870 --> 01:16.070
Scar: 100 ryo.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.880
<b>100 ryo</b>

01:17.510 --> 01:20.430
Can I assume the reward 
matches how well they fight?

01:20.610 --> 01:22.060
Who knows?

01:22.060 --> 01:25.700
Could be the strength of the target.
Could be the depth of the grudge.

01:25.700 --> 01:28.490
The client sets the rate.

01:28.990 --> 01:33.220
Still, 100 ryo? That's something special.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.720
Now, take your pick, successor.

01:37.620 --> 01:39.490
Who will you kill?

01:59.850 --> 02:04.150

01:59.850 --> 02:04.150

03:27.580 --> 03:29.560
We're sure not finding any jobs, huh?

03:29.560 --> 03:33.150
Damn it. Why don't we just rob somebody?

03:34.750 --> 03:36.810
Huh? I know you, boy.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.560
Funazo-san.

03:41.810 --> 03:43.900
It's me, Nio. It's been a long time.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.160
I owe you for back then.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.960
My daughter and I are getting by now.

03:49.110 --> 03:50.620
I'm glad to hear it.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.080
Wh-Who's this?

03:52.260 --> 03:53.580
You know this guy?

03:53.590 --> 03:55.590
<b>Any work welcome</b>

03:53.590 --> 03:55.590
<b>Gimme money</b>

03:53.840 --> 03:54.550
Yup.

03:54.550 --> 03:55.570
Huh...

03:56.100 --> 03:58.530
Are you looking for work, young Nio?

03:58.980 --> 04:00.600
I know just the thing.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.400
What? Really?

04:12.800 --> 04:16.230
F-Funazo-san, is this your new bride?

04:16.580 --> 04:19.810
P-Perish the thought. 
She's merely an acquaintance.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.530
Forgive me.

04:22.900 --> 04:23.710
I'm Nio.

04:24.380 --> 04:26.160
What pretty hair you have.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.150
Like somen noodles.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.030
Thank you.

04:30.030 --> 04:33.190
This is Nagi-san, the lady 
of a proper samurai house.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.620
What are you clapping for?

04:37.020 --> 04:38.510
I see you're with child.

04:38.870 --> 04:40.470
When is the baby due?

04:40.700 --> 04:43.430
I don't know, but it can't be long now.

04:43.430 --> 04:44.450
Don't you care?

04:44.660 --> 04:47.430
Nagi-san wants to take a boat downriver.

04:47.430 --> 04:50.470
I'll give you some pocket money 
if you'll help me take her.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.320
We'd love to help.

04:52.540 --> 04:54.720
Don't make us work for cheap!

04:59.140 --> 05:00.790
Please watch your step.

05:00.790 --> 05:01.730
Right.

05:01.970 --> 05:04.770
So why do you want to go downriver?

05:05.190 --> 05:06.070
That's my secret.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.500
Forgive me. I didn't mean to pry.

05:10.030 --> 05:11.540
L-Like this?

05:11.720 --> 05:13.570
You've got a knack for it, young Taro.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.250
Yes, praise me more.

05:15.820 --> 05:16.960
Step right this way.

05:16.960 --> 05:17.650
Okay.

05:20.370 --> 05:22.390
Nagi-san, that's the river!

05:22.390 --> 05:23.910
This way! Over here!

05:24.380 --> 05:25.990
That gave me a fright.

05:25.990 --> 05:27.970
You took the words out of my mouth!

05:27.970 --> 05:29.600
P-Please try to be careful!

05:29.740 --> 05:31.900
H-Hey, Nio. C'mere a sec.

05:31.900 --> 05:32.510
What is it?

05:32.510 --> 05:34.510
You've got to watch your step, Nagi-san.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.700
This lady's fishy.

05:34.510 --> 05:35.820
Yes, of course.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.140
Y-You think so?

05:37.480 --> 05:40.520
What pregnant woman wants to go downriver?

05:40.820 --> 05:43.210
Are you sure she's not 
planning to drown herself?

05:43.210 --> 05:45.540
Drown herself? Surely not.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.120
What a cool breeze.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.660
It feels lovely.

05:53.660 --> 05:55.160
I-It sure does.

05:55.160 --> 05:58.030
Look, the water's sparkling.

05:58.030 --> 05:59.500
I feel like it could suck me in.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.120
Please don't!

06:03.110 --> 06:04.760
There's a boat coming the other way!

06:04.930 --> 06:06.300
We're fine. Stay on course.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.370
It's going to get a little bumpy.

06:14.030 --> 06:15.900
P-Please hold on tight.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.540
Hold on?

06:20.930 --> 06:23.890
T-To the boat. Like this.

06:23.890 --> 06:25.980
Oh, to the boat?

06:27.570 --> 06:29.360
<i>I might as well just ask her.</i>

06:30.620 --> 06:32.210
E-Excuse me, Nagi-san...

06:33.060 --> 06:37.110
If something's troubling you, 
I'd be happy to listen.

06:37.110 --> 06:38.280
Troubling me?

06:38.790 --> 06:40.220
Let me see...

06:40.220 --> 06:42.750
I have so many worries, 
it's hard to pick just one.

06:43.720 --> 06:48.710
W-Well, you have a baby on the way, 
so please don't do anything rash.

06:48.710 --> 06:52.880
When I was little, 
everyone called me "Ollow."

06:53.270 --> 06:55.390
I asked them, "What's that mean?"

06:55.760 --> 06:59.490
They said, "You're always in such a daze, 
your head must be <i>hollow</i>."

07:00.260 --> 07:02.840
I thought that was a good one.

07:03.150 --> 07:05.880
<i>"Hollow"? As in "empty"?</i>

07:07.430 --> 07:08.050
A bridge!

07:09.640 --> 07:11.450
Isn't the river nice?

07:19.420 --> 07:20.670
Does it bother you?

07:21.270 --> 07:23.200
No, not a bit.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.290
Huh? Really?

07:25.290 --> 07:28.020
I lost my parents when I was young.

07:28.020 --> 07:30.790
I just happened to meet a good man.

07:30.790 --> 07:35.280
My family weren't samurai, 
and I'm so clumsy, I'm always a burden.

07:37.220 --> 07:38.530
But that makes me think.

07:39.280 --> 07:39.980
Look.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.160
A crescent moon?

07:43.550 --> 07:45.490
Gorgeous, isn't it?

07:46.050 --> 07:50.640
Isn't it funny how everything 
beautiful is missing something?

07:52.850 --> 07:55.240
Maybe the same goes for us.

07:56.370 --> 07:57.740
Like this river.

07:58.220 --> 08:03.000
Even if it gets weak or rough 
or takes an unexpected turn,

08:03.150 --> 08:04.690
or if it gets silty sometimes,

08:05.060 --> 08:09.510
we have to show respect, 
deference, and humility.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.510
And live gracefully as the current takes us.

08:19.660 --> 08:23.390
Um, aren't you scared to give birth?

08:23.660 --> 08:25.090
It seems like it must hurt.

08:25.090 --> 08:27.040
Of course I'm scared.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.030
But I'm in no rush.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.030
No rush?

08:30.480 --> 08:34.520
Well, tomorrow's me 
will figure something out.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.380
Huh? Is that funny?

08:39.380 --> 08:41.080
Did I say something funny?

08:41.630 --> 08:45.040
<i>This person is strong. I guess 
this is another kind of strength.</i>

08:45.990 --> 08:47.370
Hey!

08:47.550 --> 08:49.090
Nagi-san!

08:49.590 --> 08:51.180
I finally found you!

08:52.340 --> 08:53.360
My husband.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.840
Sorry, Funazo-san. My wife made some 
more unreasonable demands, didn't she?

09:00.840 --> 09:01.800
Not at all.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.750
"Unreasonable demands"? I would never.

09:04.750 --> 09:07.200
These boys were good enough to help.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.390
Oh, I see.

09:08.390 --> 09:09.160
I'm Nio.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.520
A-And I'm Taro.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.520
I really appreciate it.

09:13.030 --> 09:17.530
I'm Yotaro, and I run a dojo on 
the other side of Sanjo-oohashi.

09:17.950 --> 09:20.760
Please stop by if you're 
ever in the neighborhood.

09:21.130 --> 09:22.160
We'd love to.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.790
Let's head home before it gets dark.

09:24.790 --> 09:25.390
Okay.

09:27.120 --> 09:27.960
Excuse me.

09:29.380 --> 09:32.160
How can I learn to be strong like you?

09:35.820 --> 09:38.550
You're plenty strong already.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.940
Oh, dear. I still need to buy tofu.

09:43.110 --> 09:43.970
Bye now.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.810
Whoops. Watch your step.

09:53.290 --> 09:55.340
You don't look even a little tough.

09:56.530 --> 09:57.880
Whoa. Watch it.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.460
Taro-kun, let's get strong.

09:59.460 --> 10:02.120
What? No, stop. We're supposed
 to be making money.

10:02.570 --> 10:05.610
<i>I don't understand, 
but that's what makes me think.</i>

10:07.240 --> 10:09.400
Taro-kun, let's make money the strong way.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.960
What even <i>is</i> the strong way?

10:11.400 --> 10:13.120
<i>So that I can keep getting closer.</i>

10:13.840 --> 10:14.760
Funazo-san!

10:15.140 --> 10:16.930
I'll help you take your boat back.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.440
Will you help me hawk fish?

10:19.440 --> 10:20.800
Not for nothing.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.280
Now you're talking.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.680
He <i>is</i> strong.

10:28.950 --> 10:32.800
I can't believe we walked 
all over town hawking fish.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.800
But we made Funazo-san happy.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.280
Oh! Hey!

10:36.810 --> 10:37.700
Hey, Nio!

10:38.600 --> 10:39.510
Guys!

10:41.320 --> 10:42.560
You're late.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.040
Hajime-kun. You beat us home.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.190
You smell funny. 
And you're all beat up, too.

10:50.190 --> 10:51.790
Shut up, monkey brains.

10:52.170 --> 10:52.990
I'm back.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.670
He's beat up even worse than you!

11:00.200 --> 11:03.300
I have returned.

11:03.550 --> 11:04.400
And drunk.

11:04.870 --> 11:06.680
Did you make a lot of money?

11:06.680 --> 11:09.180
What a foolish question!

11:10.600 --> 11:12.680
<i>Good thing we've got adults we can count on!</i>

11:16.010 --> 11:17.690
All done.

11:18.230 --> 11:20.230
We're all done gathering funds.

11:22.270 --> 11:23.630
I see we're all here.

11:23.940 --> 11:25.320
Let's count up our earnings.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.160
How much do we need 
to have those coats made?

11:28.420 --> 11:29.040
Nio!

11:29.430 --> 11:31.080
We need 250 ryo, sir.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.710
Now, put your earnings in the bowl!

11:34.760 --> 11:35.710
Yeah!

11:35.710 --> 11:36.390
At last.

11:36.390 --> 11:37.080
Leave it to me.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.400
And me.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.340
Count me in!

11:39.520 --> 11:40.700
All right! Good work, men!

11:40.700 --> 11:41.470
Whoa!

11:41.470 --> 11:42.960
Keep it coming!

11:42.960 --> 11:44.470
All done.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.230
So how much did we make?

11:55.290 --> 11:56.200
Eight mon?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.870
Are you kidding me?!

11:58.870 --> 12:01.120
You'd better not be holding out on us!

12:01.120 --> 12:02.610
Same to you!

12:02.830 --> 12:05.240
Okay, who put in these mon coins?

12:05.400 --> 12:07.320
Me and Taro-kun.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.230
We helped sell fish.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.920
I'm sorry it's only a drop in the bucket.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.970
D-Don't apologize, Nio.

12:13.970 --> 12:15.630
What were you guys doing?

12:15.630 --> 12:17.740
We lost everything gambling!

12:17.740 --> 12:20.380
We pawned our swords 
and can't get them back.

12:20.380 --> 12:22.360
We are samurai no more.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.760
You reap what you sow.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.260
What about you two?

12:25.260 --> 12:29.140
We worked as bodyguards, 
secretly following this real cutie around.

12:29.140 --> 12:29.960
<i>Creepy.</i>

12:29.960 --> 12:32.410
She turned out to come from a good family.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.800
Her father insisted we accept 
a token of his gratitude.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.640
What? That's amazing.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.400
This fine erotic print.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.380
Wow.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.390
Why?

12:41.680 --> 12:42.770
And you, Kondo-san?

12:43.010 --> 12:43.490
Right.

12:44.490 --> 12:47.500
To my great shame, I failed to catch a cat.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.320
Some help you are!

12:49.450 --> 12:51.440
I helped out in the fields.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.920
Oh, Gen-san.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.410
Words of thanks were my reward.

12:55.410 --> 12:56.590
Get money next time!

12:56.800 --> 12:58.470
A-And your group, Serizawa-san?

12:58.470 --> 13:02.800
We challenged dojos! 
Naturally, we won every bout.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.320
Making money couldn't be simpler.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.970
They paid us to return their signboards.

13:09.470 --> 13:12.630
That put us in a grand mood.

13:12.630 --> 13:15.030
So grand that we spent it all drinking.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.500
Wh-What are we going to do?

13:18.500 --> 13:21.020
We'll never make any money like this!

13:25.430 --> 13:26.170
There's 10 ryo.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.430
What?! Did you say 10 ryo?!

13:28.430 --> 13:29.750
Whoa.

13:29.860 --> 13:32.270
I bet you won it gambling, you lucky devil.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.860
Don't lump me in with you.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.440
I knew I smelled blood on you.

13:36.760 --> 13:37.630
Shut up.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.140
This still isn't nearly enough.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.940
Only the children turned a profit.

13:50.940 --> 13:52.030
We'll never...

13:52.030 --> 13:53.780
...get those coats made.

13:54.470 --> 13:55.320
No.

13:56.170 --> 13:59.520
We borrowed the full 
250 ryo from the Aizu Domain.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.020
Yamanami-san! Niimi-san!

14:05.330 --> 14:06.610
Which means...

14:09.670 --> 14:11.720
We can make the coats!

14:14.610 --> 14:15.700
Always a step ahead.

14:16.910 --> 14:19.050
It's a loan with no interest or due date.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.150
It seems the Shogun's influence
 worked in our favor.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.760
I see. Then we owe Nio.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.950
Still, I liked that old man 
we met at the gambling hall.

14:29.950 --> 14:31.480
He even bought us a drink.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.640
Yes, he was quite an agreeable fellow.

14:34.860 --> 14:36.710
I hope our paths cross again.

14:43.770 --> 14:46.380
In any case, elder, have a seat.

14:46.650 --> 14:48.890
No. Tonight, we celebrate our rising.

14:49.110 --> 14:52.160
I ought to wait till we've all assembled.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.810
I'm sure the others will be late.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.510
Let's start without them.

14:58.110 --> 15:01.540
Make merry. We'll drink this night away.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.200
Well, we're already drinking.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.440
What do you say we wash down 
the wine with words?

15:10.720 --> 15:14.180
We, the Blood Risshidan, 
have our target: the Miburo.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.120
Oh?

15:16.800 --> 15:19.120
Listen, I've got an idea.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.410
Here's the plan.

15:21.650 --> 15:22.360
Who's there?

15:26.630 --> 15:29.110
Naozumi-niisan, it's me, Nagi.

15:29.110 --> 15:30.580
Oh, Nagi.

15:30.580 --> 15:34.320
You may have married my brother, 
but that's no excuse for eavesdropping.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.780
I bought some fine tofu. 
Don't you like tofu?

15:39.190 --> 15:41.040
N-Now's not the time!

15:41.250 --> 15:42.120
My.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.360
Women don't belong near the dojo.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.030
Yes, yes.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.930
What to do?

15:50.930 --> 15:52.400
Nagi-san.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.640
You shouldn't slip out of bed like that.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.680
It's bad for the baby.

15:58.330 --> 15:59.940
Yotaro-san.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.750
Uh, your brother and 
his friends are in the dojo—

16:02.750 --> 16:06.230
Don't worry. You can leave them to me.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.620
How was it?

16:18.620 --> 16:20.080
Don't move, Nagi-san.

16:20.290 --> 16:22.040
It's over. Everything's fine now.

16:22.310 --> 16:23.370
Is it really?

16:23.570 --> 16:25.890
Yeah. Let's turn in. It's getting late.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.340
Something's been bothering me.

16:32.510 --> 16:33.660
You startled me.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.090
What's bothering you?

16:35.340 --> 16:39.360
It's been two months since 
your father left so suddenly.

16:39.490 --> 16:40.840
Yes, it has.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.550
It's strange.

16:42.550 --> 16:45.300
He used to visit the dojo every day.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.110
You know my father.

16:47.420 --> 16:51.070
Maybe he went off on a training journey 
without telling anyone.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.600
That's not all.

16:52.830 --> 16:56.400
It's also the way the students 
in the dojo look at you.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.120
At me?

16:57.360 --> 17:00.850
They, well... It's like they're mocking you.

17:01.030 --> 17:03.310
They act almost contemptuous, I suppose.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.490
You can tell, Nagi-san?

17:05.830 --> 17:09.260
I can. And I don't just mean a handful.

17:09.640 --> 17:15.810
So many people from who-knows-where 
have started visiting, like those men in there.

17:16.000 --> 17:16.760
True.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.150
It all started when Naozumi-san 
returned from his tour of the country.

17:23.030 --> 17:23.440
True.

17:24.560 --> 17:28.890
My brother seems to be enjoying himself.
 Maybe I should ask him to let me join in.

17:29.070 --> 17:30.600
I have no business with you.

17:31.830 --> 17:34.930
Go away. You're killing the mood.

17:35.620 --> 17:38.510
I... I guess I'll try another time.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.240
Okay, my mind's made up. 
I'll talk things out with my brother.

17:45.880 --> 17:49.510
So try to relax and focus on 
giving birth to a healthy child.

17:52.210 --> 17:52.780
All right.

18:00.010 --> 18:02.540
Yes, good. Shout nice and loud.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.830
Nishimura-san, did you hurt your wrist?

18:12.270 --> 18:15.230
Did you get in a fight? 
You need to stop that.

18:15.230 --> 18:19.280
You're a strong man. If you draw 
your sword in the heat of the moment—

18:21.800 --> 18:25.290
D-Did I offend you? I'm sorry.

18:31.530 --> 18:33.800
<i>I certainly have a hard road ahead.</i>

18:35.930 --> 18:39.610
We'll make this city 
of Kyoto our battlefield.

18:41.360 --> 18:45.220
That leaves one problem: 
how to talk Yotaro around.

18:50.790 --> 18:53.480
<i>Mother, please protect me.</i>

18:54.050 --> 18:55.400
M-Mistress!

18:59.570 --> 19:02.200
I thought I'd find you here on her deathday.

19:03.220 --> 19:05.600
What has you so flustered?

19:05.940 --> 19:09.480
The night before last, a man 
caused trouble near Nijo Castle,

19:09.820 --> 19:12.140
then bit through his tongue and died.

19:12.140 --> 19:14.510
The magistrate wants to know 
if he was one of our students.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.140
M-Mistress! You shouldn't run!

19:29.420 --> 19:31.610
Our target: the Miburo.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.520
<i>What are the "Miburo"?</i>

19:35.370 --> 19:38.190
Nagi-san, look after this place.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.340
<i>I know something's about to happen.</i>

19:44.070 --> 19:45.700
<i>Something dreadful.</i>

19:48.700 --> 19:51.120
E-Excuse me. Let me see.

19:51.730 --> 19:54.000
Thank you for yesterday, Yotaro-san.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.900
It's so good to see you.

19:57.090 --> 19:59.170
Thank you for coming, Nio-kun.

19:59.170 --> 20:01.140
Is Nagi-san inside?

20:01.480 --> 20:05.350
She's probably visiting the graveyard today, 
but I think she'll be home soon.

20:06.000 --> 20:06.960
<i>Nio-kun.</i>

20:07.850 --> 20:10.110
He assisted my wife yesterday.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.600
Did he? I'm glad to hear it.

20:12.890 --> 20:14.800
Sorry for dropping in so suddenly.

20:15.130 --> 20:18.420
You see, we borrowed money 
from Aizu at the Konkai-Komyoji Temple,

20:18.420 --> 20:20.370
and are on our way back 
from thanking them.

20:20.450 --> 20:23.370
Oh, so you're men of Aizu?

20:23.510 --> 20:25.560
Oh, no, we're not.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.240
We're Miburo.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.180
<i>Miburo?</i>

20:30.190 --> 20:32.960
Still, it's always nice to be in a dojo.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.420
You like dojos?

20:34.690 --> 20:35.210
Yes.

20:36.220 --> 20:42.510
I should've introduced myself. I'm Kyohachi 
Yotaro, head of the Kyohachi School here.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.780
You run a dojo at your age?

20:44.780 --> 20:45.850
I'm 29.

20:45.850 --> 20:46.630
So am I.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.350
I have my own dojo in Edo.

20:49.350 --> 20:50.820
Really? You do?

20:50.820 --> 20:52.470
Would you care to spar?

20:52.680 --> 20:54.910
That's a great idea.
I'd love to learn from you.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.640
Naozumi, I know Yotaro's 
your little brother,

20:58.640 --> 21:01.740
but you don't <i>need</i> to put him 
at the head of the Risshidan.

21:02.310 --> 21:06.650
He can't be honest with you or his wife. 
Not even his students respect him.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.040
No, we need him.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.690
You don't know the real Yotaro.

21:14.130 --> 21:18.050
He's the only man fit to lead the Risshidan.
 He's a paragon of the sword.

21:19.080 --> 21:22.580
He's a true martial god. 
No one could ever defeat him.

21:23.620 --> 21:26.390
And what if he loses?

21:28.780 --> 21:30.780
If someone can pull that off,

21:31.670 --> 21:34.070
he'll be more than any of us can handle.

21:45.030 --> 21:50.040
<b>Like</b>

21:45.030 --> 21:50.040
<b>a
River's
Flow</b>

23:20.160 --> 23:25.550
<b>Next time</b>

23:24.530 --> 23:26.000
It is I, Kondo Isami.

23:26.630 --> 23:30.970
I always like a dojo, and I like to match 
blades with skilled opponents even more.

23:31.840 --> 23:37.720
For my Shieikan in Edo, 
and for the Miburo, I must master the way.

23:38.590 --> 23:42.330
I shall hone my techniques, 
strengthen my body, and temper my spirit.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.680
Next time: "To Battle."

23:45.190 --> 23:46.460
It is not to be missed.

23:47.190 --> 23:50.030
<b>To Battle</b>
