00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:09.696
And that's your biggest worry?

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.864
Yes, any kind
of virus.

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:13.348
But most probably
something similar to influenza.

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:14.433
Because of air travel.

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:15.474
Through the air.

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:17.019
- Coughing...
- I'm sorry.

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:18.812
I meant people. On planes.

00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:20.456
That was something you described
in your book.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.442
Yes, a new virus
in Madagascar, say, could be in Chicago

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:24.526
within a matter of weeks,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.571
and we end up with a global pandemic.
Pan meaning "all."

00:00:27.654 --> 00:00:29.948
The whole world becomes sick
all at once.

00:00:31.283 --> 00:00:33.827
And, Dr. Neuman,
you're also an epidemiologist.

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:34.912
I presume the prospect

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:36.848
of a viral pandemic keeps you up
at night as well.

00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:38.165
- No.
- No?

00:00:38.248 --> 00:00:40.000
- No.
- All right, well, that's our show.

00:00:41.084 --> 00:00:43.879
No, mankind has been
at war with the virus from the start.

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:47.174
Sometimes, millions of people die,
as in an actual war.

00:00:47.257 --> 00:00:49.676
But in the end, we always win.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.013
Just to be clear, you do think
microorganisms pose a threat.

00:00:53.263 --> 00:00:55.057
Oh, in the most dire terms.

00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.184
- Bacteria.
- No.

00:00:57.267 --> 00:00:59.061
- You like saying no.
- Yes.

00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:02.522
Not bacteria. Not viruses.

00:01:02.606 --> 00:01:04.399
- So?
- Fungus.

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:08.070
Yes, that's the usual response.

00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:09.863
Fungi seem harmless enough.

00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:11.657
Many species know otherwise.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.910
Because there are some fungi
who seek not to kill,

00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:16.453
but to control.

00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:19.164
Let me ask you,
where do we get LSD from?

00:01:19.248 --> 00:01:21.166
Where do you get it from?

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.460
It comes from ergot, a fungus.

00:01:23.543 --> 00:01:25.837
Psilocybin, also a fungus.

00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:29.800
Viruses can make us ill,
but fungi can alter our very minds.

00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:31.927
There's a fungus that infects insects.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.887
Gets inside an ant, for example,

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:37.182
travels through its circulatory system
to the ant's brain,

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.142
and then floods it with hallucinogens,

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:42.521
thus bending the ant's mind to its will.

00:01:42.604 --> 00:01:44.564
The fungus starts to direct
the ant's behavior,

00:01:44.648 --> 00:01:46.275
telling it where to go, what to do,

00:01:46.358 --> 00:01:48.402
like a puppeteer with a marionette.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.945
And it gets worse.

00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:51.405
The fungus needs food to live,

00:01:51.488 --> 00:01:54.825
so it begins to devour
its host from within,

00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:57.411
replacing the ant's flesh with its own,

00:01:57.494 --> 00:01:59.329
but it doesn't let its victim die.

00:01:59.413 --> 00:02:04.584
No, it keeps its puppet alive
by preventing decomposition.

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:08.046
- How? Where do we get penicillin from?
- Fungus.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.067
Dr. Schoenheiss, you're in distress.

00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:14.052
Fungal infection of this kind is real,
but not in humans.

00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:16.054
True, fungi cannot survive

00:02:16.138 --> 00:02:19.891
if its host's internal temperature
is over 94 degrees.

00:02:19.975 --> 00:02:22.519
And currently, there are no reasons
for fungi to evolve

00:02:22.602 --> 00:02:24.289
to be able to withstand
higher temperatures.

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:25.498
But what if that were to change?

00:02:25.522 --> 00:02:28.317
What if, for instance,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.819
the world were to get slightly warmer?

00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:34.531
Well, now there is reason to evolve.

00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:38.869
One gene mutates and an ascomycete,
candida, ergot,

00:02:38.952 --> 00:02:41.955
cordyceps, aspergillus,
any one of them could become

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:44.082
capable of burrowing into our brains

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:46.543
and taking control,
not of millions of us,

00:02:46.626 --> 00:02:47.836
but billions of us.

00:02:48.378 --> 00:02:51.214
Billions of puppets with poisoned minds

00:02:51.298 --> 00:02:54.051
permanently fixed on one unifying goal:

00:02:54.426 --> 00:02:58.597
to spread the infection
to every last human alive

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.973
by any means necessary.

00:03:00.057 --> 00:03:01.534
And there are no treatments for this.

00:03:01.558 --> 00:03:04.019
No preventatives, no cures.

00:03:04.102 --> 00:03:06.938
They don't exist.
It's not even possible to make them.

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:09.733
So, if that happens...

00:03:11.777 --> 00:03:12.861
We lose.

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:18.450
We'll be back.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.261
Alarm.

00:05:02.804 --> 00:05:03.930
Alarm!

00:05:20.447 --> 00:05:22.866
- Where's the pancake mix?
- Oh, was I...

00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:24.576
Yeah, I was. Sorry.

00:05:24.743 --> 00:05:26.411
I was gonna make you birthday pancakes.

00:05:26.495 --> 00:05:27.746
I swear.

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:29.456
You know I don't really like pancakes.

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.083
I know you don't like them.
It was for my benefit.

00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:37.213
Vitamin C.

00:05:46.056 --> 00:05:47.766
You get your homework done?

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:51.186
Fractions?

00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:56.441
- How old are you again?
- Thirty-six.

00:05:57.526 --> 00:06:00.246
- You're gonna have to wear diapers soon.
- Who says I don't already?

00:06:03.532 --> 00:06:04.448
Shell.

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:05.575
Calcium.

00:06:06.326 --> 00:06:07.326
Lovely.

00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:10.306
Is there enough for Uncle Tommy?

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.706
Well, there would've been.

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:14.583
Hey.

00:06:14.584 --> 00:06:15.984
You're still alive, you old fucker.

00:06:16.336 --> 00:06:17.629
Aw. He loves you.

00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:19.589
He's dependent on me. Not the same.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.132
I think it's the same.

00:06:21.216 --> 00:06:23.552
It's definitely the same.
I thought we was having pancakes.

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:25.780
We'll pick you somethin' up on the road.

00:06:25.804 --> 00:06:28.014
- Concrete guys gonna be there?
- Yeah, they said maybe.

00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:31.184
Maybe? We can't frame until we pour.
We're not getting paid until we frame.

00:06:31.268 --> 00:06:33.454
Well, we could bring someone else on,
get the job done faster.

00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:36.198
No, no. I'm not splitting this job.
I barely wanna split it with you.

00:06:36.815 --> 00:06:37.816
We could work a double.

00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:40.694
- Literally? Today?
- I know. I'll be done by 9:00.

00:06:40.777 --> 00:06:42.112
By 9:00, right?

00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:43.821
Yeah.

00:06:45.073 --> 00:06:46.241
I'll bring back a cake.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:47.866
I promise.

00:06:50.495 --> 00:06:52.831
...continued
disturbances in Jakarta,

00:06:52.914 --> 00:06:54.249
but are advising US citizens...

00:06:54.332 --> 00:06:56.376
Jakarta. Where is that, Middle East?

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:58.437
It doesn't ring a bell.
It's definitely a country.

00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:00.672
- Or maybe part of Asia?
- Jakarta isn't a country.

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:03.425
Being a part of Asia isn't
mutually exclusive with being a country,

00:07:03.508 --> 00:07:05.427
and in fact,
it's the capital of Indonesia.

00:07:05.927 --> 00:07:08.013
Shit. Hope for us yet.

00:07:14.853 --> 00:07:15.853
All right.

00:07:16.646 --> 00:07:18.315
Finish up quick, we'll drop you off.

00:07:18.398 --> 00:07:20.984
- I'm still eating my eggshells.
- You got seven minutes.

00:07:21.067 --> 00:07:22.777
Your t-shirt's inside out.

00:07:26.114 --> 00:07:27.449
Shit.

00:07:29.993 --> 00:07:30.993
He's losing it.

00:08:12.243 --> 00:08:14.329
Sarah!

00:08:20.502 --> 00:08:21.586
Hey, neighbor!

00:08:22.295 --> 00:08:23.296
Oh, hi.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.717
Connie was asking after you,
since you haven't been over in a while.

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:29.177
You make 'em happy.

00:08:30.595 --> 00:08:33.890
I could come by after school,
but just for, like, a little bit.

00:08:33.973 --> 00:08:35.266
She'll take whatcha got.

00:08:35.684 --> 00:08:37.894
Y'all can bake or whatever.

00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:39.437
Speaking of,

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:41.564
we got a lot of extra here.

00:08:41.648 --> 00:08:43.149
Y'all want some biscuits?

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.694
Dad, you love biscuits.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.533
I do.

00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:52.951
But I'm on Atkins.

00:08:53.493 --> 00:08:56.121
- On what now?
- It's a... You know what?

00:08:56.204 --> 00:08:57.872
We gotta run, but Sarah'll be by later.

00:08:57.956 --> 00:08:59.582
She'll stay as long as you want,

00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:01.918
tell you all about Atkins.

00:09:02.001 --> 00:09:04.003
Great! I'll let Connie know.

00:09:04.713 --> 00:09:05.713
Solid.

00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:11.946
Can't tell you how exciting it was
listening to that fucking conversation.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.971
Put that out.

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:15.724
Happy birthday to you.

00:09:26.025 --> 00:09:29.195
I want you to write this diagram out
exactly as I have it.

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:31.906
Always subject and predicate,

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.658
verb and noun.

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:37.370
Okay? The sentence is,
"Where are you going?" Subject is "You".

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:39.330
"You are going",

00:09:40.165 --> 00:09:41.624
predicate.

00:09:41.708 --> 00:09:43.251
"Where", adverb.

00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:45.879
You see it? Okay.
I have some nods, shaking of heads.

00:09:45.962 --> 00:09:47.922
I swear you will use this later in life.

00:09:48.006 --> 00:09:49.799
Believe me, that's why you're here.

00:09:49.883 --> 00:09:51.009
Okay? So...

00:09:57.515 --> 00:09:59.235
Yes, you need
to know this!

00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:01.227
Yes, it's on your test next week!

00:10:01.978 --> 00:10:05.523
Homework is due end of class tomorrow!

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:01.119
Twenty.

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:02.579
That's it?

00:11:02.831 --> 00:11:03.957
Okay, 30.

00:11:05.124 --> 00:11:06.167
Twenty's good.

00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:08.461
It's a spring. I'll do it right now.

00:11:27.897 --> 00:11:30.066
All day. I swear.

00:11:33.152 --> 00:11:34.152
We're closing.

00:11:35.989 --> 00:11:37.240
We're done for today.

00:11:37.323 --> 00:11:38.908
It's 3:15, we close at 7:00.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.873
- I'm very sorry. He cannot finish.
- I'm already finished.

00:11:48.877 --> 00:11:50.169
You should go home.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.649
- There you are, sweetie.
- Sorry.

00:12:11.733 --> 00:12:13.026
I was getting worried.

00:12:13.109 --> 00:12:14.903
I was getting something for my dad.

00:12:15.695 --> 00:12:16.738
Hi, Mercy.

00:12:18.948 --> 00:12:22.243
Hey, is everything okay?
Like, on the news?

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.703
Like what, hon?

00:12:24.329 --> 00:12:27.540
Well, no, there was just a lot of police
and stuff on the road today.

00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:29.459
Well, that's true every day, isn't it?

00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:32.128
People out there need
to get right with Jesus.

00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:36.299
Three nails plus one cross
equals four-given.

00:12:37.467 --> 00:12:39.427
I was thinking we'd make some cookies.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.678
Chocolate chip?

00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:42.262
Raisin.

00:12:51.022 --> 00:12:53.191
Come on, Mama. It's green.

00:12:53.274 --> 00:12:54.754
You love that.

00:12:55.401 --> 00:12:56.653
Here we go!

00:12:58.154 --> 00:12:59.739
I don't know why I talk to her.

00:12:59.822 --> 00:13:01.366
She's completely deaf.

00:13:30.478 --> 00:13:31.562
Wanna give me a hand?

00:13:31.646 --> 00:13:32.855
Be right there!

00:13:55.128 --> 00:13:56.462
Hey, Mrs. Adler?

00:13:56.546 --> 00:13:58.089
Could I borrow this?

00:14:00.842 --> 00:14:02.385
Yeah, sure.

00:14:02.844 --> 00:14:04.053
It's one of Danny's.

00:14:05.346 --> 00:14:07.265
You know what?
My dad's gonna be back real soon.

00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:09.058
- I should go.
- You sure?

00:14:09.142 --> 00:14:11.561
- Yeah.
- Well, then you're taking some cookies.

00:15:00.777 --> 00:15:03.088
No comment today
from the Austin Police Department

00:15:03.112 --> 00:15:06.199
regarding a rash of violent incidents
across the city,

00:15:06.282 --> 00:15:09.535
some suggesting a new street drug
may be to blame.

00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:13.164
More on that when we return,
with Manuela Sanchez reporting live...

00:15:20.546 --> 00:15:22.048
You locked the door for once.

00:15:22.715 --> 00:15:24.717
- Good job.
- Yeah.

00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:31.516
- It's 10:00.
- I know.

00:15:32.016 --> 00:15:35.061
They gave us the wrong size
for the headers.

00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:38.314
That doesn't mean anything to you.
I'm sorry.

00:15:39.315 --> 00:15:40.315
Where's the cake?

00:15:41.234 --> 00:15:43.194
- Shit.
- Come on, man.

00:15:43.277 --> 00:15:44.557
I'll get us one tomorrow.

00:15:44.821 --> 00:15:47.657
Swear? Or you don't get your present.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.992
- You got me a present?
- Swear.

00:15:50.827 --> 00:15:51.828
On my life.

00:15:59.544 --> 00:16:00.545
Wow.

00:16:04.674 --> 00:16:05.674
Fixed it for you.

00:16:13.349 --> 00:16:14.642
- Did you?
- What?

00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:15.852
I don't hear anything.

00:16:17.311 --> 00:16:18.311
That was lame.

00:16:18.354 --> 00:16:20.189
- You're lame.
- Yeah, I know.

00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:23.109
Where'd you get the money for this?

00:16:23.693 --> 00:16:25.528
Drugs. I sell hardcore drugs.

00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:26.696
It's better than what I do.

00:16:26.779 --> 00:16:29.115
It was only $20, which I stole from you.

00:16:30.616 --> 00:16:31.826
I could've stolen $60,

00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:33.804
but I put the change back
because I'm an honest thief.

00:16:33.828 --> 00:16:35.955
- Hmm.
- Besides, it's the thought that counts.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.249
And you were never gonna
do it for yourself, so.

00:16:43.713 --> 00:16:44.713
Thank you.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.550
There's one more.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.763
Borrowed it from the Adlers.

00:16:52.847 --> 00:16:54.891
Oh, this is the one
with the deleted scenes.

00:16:54.974 --> 00:16:57.018
Yeah, imagine how bad those have to be.

00:16:57.101 --> 00:16:59.187
Come on, pop it in.
While it's still your birthday.

00:17:08.988 --> 00:17:10.823
- Don't fall asleep.
- 'Course, I won't.

00:17:11.073 --> 00:17:12.953
It's too riveting.

00:17:34.722 --> 00:17:35.638
Hello?

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.058
Joel, it's me.

00:17:37.141 --> 00:17:38.267
I'm okay.

00:17:39.227 --> 00:17:40.895
- Yeah?
- But I'm in jail.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.523
- God damn it.
- Wasn't my fault this time.

00:17:44.607 --> 00:17:47.485
I was at the bar, some guy goes crazy,
starts swinging at a waitress,

00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:49.368
I stepped in, knocked him out,
cops show up...

00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:50.780
Look, it doesn't fucking matter.

00:17:50.863 --> 00:17:52.281
- You gotta bail me out.
- Now?

00:17:52.365 --> 00:17:53.842
It's Friday,
you don't get me out tonight,

00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:54.909
I'm in here all weekend.

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:56.994
It's a fucking madhouse, Joel.

00:17:57.078 --> 00:17:59.580
- I gotta get out.
- Which jail? Travis County?

00:17:59.664 --> 00:18:00.915
Yeah, on 10th.

00:18:00.998 --> 00:18:03.542
- God damn it, Tommy.
- I'm sorry.

00:18:05.628 --> 00:18:06.629
Please.

00:18:07.922 --> 00:18:08.922
Okay.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.466
Fucking idiot.

00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:14.321
Dad?

00:19:23.622 --> 00:19:24.622
Dad?

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:46.687
Law enforcement
and emergency services are in the area

00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:49.023
and will be in contact
with further instructions.

00:19:51.192 --> 00:19:53.402
Stay indoors. Law enforcement...

00:20:00.618 --> 00:20:02.328
Easy. Easy, Mercy.

00:20:03.496 --> 00:20:04.830
What are you doing out here, boy?

00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:35.029
Come on, let's get you home.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.698
Come on, Mercy. Please.

00:20:40.825 --> 00:20:41.867
Mercy!

00:20:53.129 --> 00:20:54.255
Mrs. Adler?

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:16.318
Mrs. Adler?

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.391
Mrs. Adler?

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:03.072
Help me.

00:22:53.415 --> 00:22:55.709
Get in the truck! Right now!

00:22:56.252 --> 00:22:57.628
Move!

00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:10.182
What are we doing, Joel?

00:23:26.532 --> 00:23:28.826
- You killed her.
- Baby, I'm sorry.

00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:30.703
- Joel, we gotta go.
- Sarah, listen to me.

00:23:31.078 --> 00:23:32.496
It's not just the Adlers.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.664
But we're gonna be brave,

00:23:33.747 --> 00:23:35.587
and we're gonna get outta this.

00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:37.668
Hey. Let's go. Come on.

00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:39.670
Get in.

00:23:41.505 --> 00:23:42.506
Joel?

00:23:42.965 --> 00:23:44.717
Denise, you get back inside the house!

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.886
- You lock your doors! Now!
- Come on, get in!

00:23:57.062 --> 00:23:58.647
- Get your seat belt on.
- Hold on.

00:24:02.526 --> 00:24:04.153
Jesus Christ, Joel!

00:24:08.532 --> 00:24:10.326
- You take 71.
- 71, I know.

00:24:19.543 --> 00:24:20.586
- Daddy...
- We don't know.

00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:23.088
They're saying it's a virus.
Some kind of parasite.

00:24:23.422 --> 00:24:24.715
Is it from terrorists?

00:24:24.798 --> 00:24:26.884
We don't know.

00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:29.678
- Are we sick?
- No. Of course not.

00:24:29.803 --> 00:24:30.971
Why did things blow up?

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.681
No cellphone, no radio.

00:24:33.349 --> 00:24:34.868
A minute ago, newsman wouldn't shut up.

00:24:34.892 --> 00:24:36.492
- How do you know?
- What?

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.050
How do you know we're not sick?

00:24:39.104 --> 00:24:41.224
They're saying
it's mostly people in the city.

00:24:41.649 --> 00:24:43.400
That's why they got
the highway blocked off.

00:24:47.112 --> 00:24:48.112
God.

00:24:48.656 --> 00:24:49.740
That's Jimmy's place.

00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:01.377
The Adlers would take Nana into the city

00:25:02.002 --> 00:25:03.337
to the hospital for stuff.

00:25:03.796 --> 00:25:06.173
That's right. They would.
That's probably why.

00:25:09.093 --> 00:25:12.638
But, you'd have to go a lot, right?

00:25:13.138 --> 00:25:14.306
We're fine. Trust me.

00:25:18.268 --> 00:25:19.269
All right.

00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:26.276
Here! Right here!

00:25:26.694 --> 00:25:28.153
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

00:25:28.237 --> 00:25:30.364
- They got a kid, Joel.
- So do we. Keep driving.

00:25:30.447 --> 00:25:32.807
- Please, no! No, no!
- We could put them in the back.

00:25:36.453 --> 00:25:37.830
Somebody else will come along.

00:25:48.966 --> 00:25:51.176
Fuck! Everybody had
the same fucking idea.

00:25:52.553 --> 00:25:55.431
- I can't get through this.
- All right. Let's think it through.

00:25:55.514 --> 00:25:56.866
- Fuck!
- All right, take the field.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.767
We cut across
and we pick up on the west side.

00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:00.561
Yeah, yeah.
West, west, all right.

00:26:00.644 --> 00:26:01.645
All right, hang on.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.411
Shit! Fucking Army.

00:26:17.494 --> 00:26:19.374
- Isn't that good?
- It's good for them,

00:26:19.455 --> 00:26:21.415
but that's the highway
we're trying to get to.

00:26:21.498 --> 00:26:22.809
All right, keep moving.
Head north.

00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:24.769
- Could be a lot of people.
- Well, we can't go south,

00:26:24.793 --> 00:26:27.313
we can't go east, we can't go west.
Hell else we supposed to go?

00:26:28.922 --> 00:26:29.922
Tommy, come on!

00:26:37.055 --> 00:26:38.056
Yeah, I know that place.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.659
- This can work.
- Yeah, but then what?

00:26:39.683 --> 00:26:41.518
I don't know. Mexico. Just far.

00:26:41.602 --> 00:26:44.897
- Far as we can. How much gas?
- Three-quarter tank.

00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:47.801
Go through town, golf course
by the river, straight across,

00:26:48.192 --> 00:26:50.569
we pick up the highway
on the other side of the blockade,

00:26:50.694 --> 00:26:51.694
then we're out.

00:27:00.412 --> 00:27:01.413
Maybe it's everywhere.

00:27:04.041 --> 00:27:05.167
Maybe there's nowhere to go.

00:27:10.923 --> 00:27:12.341
What the fuck?

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.855
Son of a bitch. Gotta go around.

00:27:27.189 --> 00:27:28.190
Grab something!

00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:45.499
All right, keep going, keep going.

00:27:45.582 --> 00:27:46.750
Shit. Tommy!

00:27:51.046 --> 00:27:52.214
Tommy, you can't stop here.

00:27:52.881 --> 00:27:54.359
- I can't drive through 'em all.
- Are you serious?

00:27:54.383 --> 00:27:55.384
Just keep going!

00:28:00.764 --> 00:28:02.182
Go, go, go. Back, back,

00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:03.934
- back, back!
- I'm trying!

00:28:08.647 --> 00:28:10.065
Tommy, go faster! We gotta go!

00:28:10.148 --> 00:28:11.501
I'm trying!
There's nowhere to fucking go!

00:28:11.525 --> 00:28:12.794
- Find an alley!
- What alley?

00:28:12.818 --> 00:28:14.546
- There's people everywhere!
- Roll the fuck over them!

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:15.988
We gotta get off this street now!

00:28:16.071 --> 00:28:17.340
That's what I'm trying to do, Joel.

00:28:17.364 --> 00:28:19.164
We're gonna be okay.
Just keep driving.

00:28:19.241 --> 00:28:20.242
Dad?

00:28:21.285 --> 00:28:22.327
Holy shit!

00:28:23.328 --> 00:28:25.497
Move. Move!

00:28:57.738 --> 00:28:59.823
Sarah, Sarah.

00:28:59.907 --> 00:29:01.241
Stay right there. Don't move.

00:29:02.618 --> 00:29:03.952
Tommy, you okay?

00:29:04.036 --> 00:29:04.952
Yeah, okay.

00:29:19.134 --> 00:29:20.719
Sarah, don't look.

00:29:21.428 --> 00:29:23.263
You look at me, okay?

00:29:23.347 --> 00:29:25.267
I'm sorry, baby, I know, I know.

00:29:25.307 --> 00:29:26.576
Come here. Put your arms around me.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.768
Come here, come here.

00:29:28.644 --> 00:29:30.854
I got you. I got you.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.480
Got you.

00:29:34.942 --> 00:29:37.027
Are you okay? Are you okay?

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.695
- My ankle.
- All right, okay.

00:29:38.779 --> 00:29:41.019
We gotta get off the street! Shit!

00:29:45.285 --> 00:29:46.285
Tommy?

00:29:47.162 --> 00:29:48.246
Tommy!

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:49.831
Tommy!

00:29:51.583 --> 00:29:53.460
Head to the river! I'll find a way.

00:29:54.503 --> 00:29:55.663
Get her outta here, Joel! Go!

00:29:57.798 --> 00:29:59.275
- We can't leave him.
- He'll be fine.

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:00.509
- Can you run?
- No.

00:30:02.219 --> 00:30:03.579
- You keep your eyes on me.
- Okay.

00:30:03.637 --> 00:30:04.553
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:30:04.554 --> 00:30:05.764
And don't look anywhere else.

00:30:06.473 --> 00:30:07.473
All right.

00:31:05.866 --> 00:31:07.743
It's okay, baby. You're safe.

00:31:08.452 --> 00:31:09.453
Don't move!

00:31:11.455 --> 00:31:14.041
- My daughter's hurt her ankle.
- Stop right there!

00:31:15.542 --> 00:31:16.543
Okay.

00:31:17.294 --> 00:31:19.713
Easy now. We're not sick!

00:31:20.297 --> 00:31:22.966
I've got two civilians by the river,
one of them injured.

00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:25.510
Ankle.

00:31:26.553 --> 00:31:27.846
What about Uncle Tommy?

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.223
We're gonna get you
somewhere safe first.

00:31:30.307 --> 00:31:31.987
- Then we'll go back for him, okay?
- Okay.

00:31:32.225 --> 00:31:33.727
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, repeat?

00:31:33.935 --> 00:31:35.729
Hey. No one told you to move.

00:31:37.773 --> 00:31:38.773
Yes, sir.

00:31:40.567 --> 00:31:41.967
Yes, sir.

00:31:44.654 --> 00:31:45.697
Yes, sir.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:51.536
We're not sick.

00:31:54.372 --> 00:31:55.457
Sir,

00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:58.001
we are not sick!

00:32:11.014 --> 00:32:12.014
I'm sorry.

00:32:13.475 --> 00:32:14.643
Please, don't.

00:32:24.486 --> 00:32:25.737
Oh, God.

00:32:31.326 --> 00:32:32.494
No.

00:32:32.786 --> 00:32:34.621
No, no. No.

00:32:35.747 --> 00:32:37.582
Okay. You're okay.

00:32:38.166 --> 00:32:39.960
You're okay. Move your hand, baby.

00:32:40.043 --> 00:32:41.086
Move your hand.

00:32:47.801 --> 00:32:49.886
I know, baby, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.096
I know it hurts.

00:32:51.847 --> 00:32:54.349
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

00:32:54.432 --> 00:32:57.018
Come on, baby. You're okay, you're okay.

00:32:57.561 --> 00:33:00.939
I know, I know, I know, I know, baby,
I know, I know. I know this hurts.

00:33:01.606 --> 00:33:02.774
You're gonna be okay.

00:33:02.858 --> 00:33:06.528
All right. Baby, baby, listen to me.

00:33:06.611 --> 00:33:08.613
I gotta get you up, okay?

00:33:08.697 --> 00:33:09.697
I gotta get you up.

00:33:10.198 --> 00:33:12.117
All right? Come on.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.077
You come on. I know, baby.

00:33:14.411 --> 00:33:16.997
No, no. I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.080
Tommy, help me!

00:33:19.583 --> 00:33:20.584
Joel.

00:33:22.002 --> 00:33:23.086
Come on, baby girl.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:24.963
Come on, baby girl. I gotta get you up.

00:33:25.046 --> 00:33:26.173
Come on.

00:33:26.256 --> 00:33:27.382
Come on, we'll get up.

00:33:27.465 --> 00:33:29.785
Come on, baby girl.

00:33:30.218 --> 00:33:32.929
Come on, come on, please.

00:36:18.428 --> 00:36:20.108
We don't want you
falling out of the chair.

00:36:21.222 --> 00:36:22.265
What's your name?

00:36:24.517 --> 00:36:25.810
Are you alone?

00:36:31.941 --> 00:36:33.193
And...

00:36:34.235 --> 00:36:35.904
how did you get this?

00:36:39.449 --> 00:36:42.160
It's gonna be
a little tickle right here.

00:36:51.753 --> 00:36:54.172
What if I told you
that after we gave you some medicine,

00:36:54.714 --> 00:36:56.591
we're gonna find you
your favorite food to eat?

00:36:57.133 --> 00:36:58.218
Would you like that?

00:36:59.386 --> 00:37:02.222
And then we'll get you
some new clothes and toys,

00:37:02.972 --> 00:37:04.682
as many as you wanna play with.

00:37:09.521 --> 00:37:10.939
It's just a little needle.

00:37:12.774 --> 00:37:14.109
It's okay.

00:37:18.947 --> 00:37:19.989
You're safe.

00:38:24.804 --> 00:38:25.804
I can't.

00:39:05.803 --> 00:39:06.803
Ten.

00:39:17.815 --> 00:39:20.652
- You got anything else?
- Nothing today.

00:39:20.735 --> 00:39:24.864
Tomorrow, we got street sweeping,
or sewer maintenance.

00:39:25.365 --> 00:39:26.533
Which pays more?

00:39:27.116 --> 00:39:28.618
That'd be the one with the shit.

00:39:33.456 --> 00:39:34.874
Late crew. 4:00 p.m. start.

00:40:11.869 --> 00:40:15.206
...violation
of EMC 342.3,

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:17.709
unauthorized exit
from a Quarantine Zone.

00:40:18.334 --> 00:40:23.298
Maria Elisiano, violation of EMC 342.7,

00:40:23.381 --> 00:40:26.426
unauthorized entry
into a Quarantine Zone.

00:40:26.509 --> 00:40:29.429
Each of you have been tried
in a military court ofjustice,

00:40:29.512 --> 00:40:33.600
and each of you having been found guilty
by the court martial panel,

00:40:33.683 --> 00:40:35.685
and with a sentence of death
by execution,

00:40:35.768 --> 00:40:40.023
as empowered under the EMPA,
Article 1, Section 5...

00:40:55.538 --> 00:40:56.538
Come on.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:05.715
- Or I could just shoot you.
- Yeah, but then what would you do?

00:41:07.759 --> 00:41:09.010
You're short five.

00:41:29.614 --> 00:41:31.407
- Oxy?
- Hydro.

00:41:32.408 --> 00:41:33.785
- How old?
- Three months.

00:41:33.868 --> 00:41:35.763
- From Atlanta?
- I don't know where he gets 'em from.

00:41:35.787 --> 00:41:38.227
- I just know they're real.
- If it's real, it's from Atlanta.

00:41:38.498 --> 00:41:40.541
FEDRA's got a factory
down there in the QZ.

00:41:40.625 --> 00:41:42.877
Supposedly only makes two things.

00:41:44.671 --> 00:41:46.714
Pills and bullets, bullets and pills.

00:41:46.798 --> 00:41:49.151
Well, the more you shoot people,
the harder it is to sleep, I guess.

00:41:49.175 --> 00:41:51.219
Oh, you guess?

00:41:52.512 --> 00:41:53.513
You want 'em or not?

00:41:58.935 --> 00:42:00.478
I need the bag back.

00:42:05.191 --> 00:42:07.031
- How are we doing with the vehicle?
- All set.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.986
Had to get one last guy in the depot
to buy in.

00:42:09.696 --> 00:42:10.863
Okay, how much?

00:42:10.947 --> 00:42:14.325
Four of them on that shift plus me,
600 total.

00:42:15.576 --> 00:42:18.079
Look, those trucks are shitheaped
for a reason.

00:42:18.162 --> 00:42:20.206
And they don't have
any batteries. I know.

00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:23.584
I can see about 200 for the other guys,
200 for you.

00:42:26.045 --> 00:42:27.045
Deal.

00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:30.508
Hey. Do yourself a favor,

00:42:31.467 --> 00:42:33.227
stay off the streets
for the next few nights.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.847
Fucking Fireflies been
blowing shit up all week.

00:42:36.389 --> 00:42:37.866
Two of our guys got shot this morning.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:41.144
Boss has got us working doubles.
Guys are jumpy and tired.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.188
It's easy to make a mistake in the dark.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.526
Stay safe.

00:42:49.318 --> 00:42:50.653
Yeah, you too.

00:43:11.716 --> 00:43:13.396
What do you want me
to say, Tess?

00:43:14.177 --> 00:43:16.304
I'm not asking you
to say anything.

00:43:18.181 --> 00:43:19.223
Sure.

00:43:22.435 --> 00:43:26.898
It's not like I planned
on ripping you off.

00:43:27.565 --> 00:43:28.565
I'm sorry.

00:43:29.901 --> 00:43:30.943
Well...

00:43:32.987 --> 00:43:35.031
how about we just let it go?

00:43:42.622 --> 00:43:44.540
What else are you gonna do?

00:43:44.624 --> 00:43:45.625
You gonna keep me here?

00:43:46.042 --> 00:43:48.211
- Kill me?
- Tess, come on.

00:43:48.294 --> 00:43:50.421
Then, Robert, what do you want?

00:43:50.505 --> 00:43:51.899
I want you to forget this ever happened.

00:43:51.923 --> 00:43:52.965
Done.

00:43:53.424 --> 00:43:54.634
- Don't do that.
- What?

00:43:54.717 --> 00:43:56.177
It's just a truck battery.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.263
I paid you for it, you sold it
to someone else, and you spent my money.

00:43:59.347 --> 00:44:00.741
You think I've
never done shit like that?

00:44:00.765 --> 00:44:03.267
- My guys fucked you up.
- Yeah, so discipline them.

00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:05.520
Cut off a finger
or whatever the fuck you want.

00:44:05.603 --> 00:44:07.203
I don't care. They're your fucking guys.

00:44:08.147 --> 00:44:09.398
What about your guy?

00:44:10.024 --> 00:44:12.211
'Cause when he sees you,
I mean... put yourself in my shoes.

00:44:12.235 --> 00:44:13.820
Look, he answers to me.

00:44:14.612 --> 00:44:17.406
So, I give you my word
that he won't hurt you.

00:44:18.157 --> 00:44:21.828
I'll tell him
that I got jumped by some guys,

00:44:21.911 --> 00:44:24.789
and then you
and I can just move the fuck on.

00:44:27.416 --> 00:44:30.711
Now your shit has
pretty much ruined my week,

00:44:30.795 --> 00:44:34.882
and I'd like to go home
and drink 'til my face stops hurting.

00:44:34.966 --> 00:44:36.342
So, are we good?

00:44:42.598 --> 00:44:43.598
Yeah.

00:44:57.238 --> 00:44:58.948
All citizens must

00:44:59.031 --> 00:45:01.325
clear the surrounding area immediately.

00:45:01.409 --> 00:45:04.245
Do not return
until FEDRA authorities permit.

00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:12.587
All citizens must clear
the surrounding area immediately.

00:45:13.296 --> 00:45:16.299
Do not return
until FEDRA authorities permit.

00:45:17.884 --> 00:45:21.929
All citizens must clear
the surrounding area immediately.

00:45:22.013 --> 00:45:24.557
Do not return
until FEDRA authorities permit.

00:45:28.144 --> 00:45:32.148
All citizens must clear
the surrounding area immediately.

00:45:32.231 --> 00:45:35.151
Do not return
until FEDRA authorities permit.

00:45:38.446 --> 00:45:42.158
All citizens must clear
the surrounding area immediately.

00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:45.745
Do not return
until FEDRA authorities permit.

00:45:45.828 --> 00:45:47.622
Shit.

00:45:48.122 --> 00:45:49.790
Firefly, up top!

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:52.501
Free Boston now, motherfuckers!

00:45:58.007 --> 00:46:00.343
Move, move, move.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:04.931
They're shooting.

00:46:05.014 --> 00:46:07.117
- They're shooting at us.
- On your knees. On your knees.

00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:08.392
No, no! I'm not a F...

00:46:12.146 --> 00:46:14.482
I'm not a Firefly!

00:46:45.346 --> 00:46:47.014
Count slowly and clearly
from one to ten.

00:46:47.098 --> 00:46:49.809
- One, two, three, four...
- Slowly, and clearly.

00:46:51.602 --> 00:46:52.602
One.

00:46:53.312 --> 00:46:54.312
Two.

00:46:54.689 --> 00:46:55.689
Three.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440
Four.

00:46:58.025 --> 00:46:59.025
Five.

00:46:59.235 --> 00:47:00.236
Six.

00:47:00.695 --> 00:47:01.695
Seven.

00:47:02.279 --> 00:47:03.322
Eight.

00:47:03.406 --> 00:47:04.824
Fuck

00:47:04.907 --> 00:47:06.075
you.

00:47:08.369 --> 00:47:09.578
And hold out your...

00:47:11.455 --> 00:47:13.833
- State your name, slowly and clearly.
- Veronica.

00:47:14.542 --> 00:47:19.964
Same as yesterday, and the day before,
and the day before, and the...

00:47:20.464 --> 00:47:22.104
Hey.
People are gonna come looking for me.

00:47:22.425 --> 00:47:24.010
People from FEDRA, you hear me?

00:47:24.093 --> 00:47:26.429
Let me out
or you're gonna pay, motherfuckers!

00:47:28.889 --> 00:47:31.225
I'm not supposed to be here!

00:48:05.426 --> 00:48:06.466
Hey, there's a line.

00:48:06.927 --> 00:48:08.679
"Tell Dad it's a girl.

00:48:09.305 --> 00:48:11.515
That would be good, right?

00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:13.642
He wanted a granddaughter.

00:48:13.726 --> 00:48:15.019
Love, Becca."

00:48:15.644 --> 00:48:16.854
End message. Read back.

00:48:21.901 --> 00:48:22.901
Correct.

00:48:22.902 --> 00:48:24.112
73-K Orlando, out.

00:48:42.963 --> 00:48:44.006
Nothing?

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.944
Is there any chance
it's coming in at night?

00:48:47.968 --> 00:48:49.261
You're asleep and you miss it?

00:48:54.642 --> 00:48:58.145
When I'm sleeping, Gabriela listens
or my son, the smart one,

00:48:58.229 --> 00:48:59.730
not the other one, God bless him.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.109
If Tommy responded, we'd know.

00:49:03.776 --> 00:49:05.653
- And you're talking to the tower?
- Every day.

00:49:05.736 --> 00:49:06.694
They gave him your message.

00:49:06.695 --> 00:49:08.365
They haven't seen
or heard from him since.

00:49:08.447 --> 00:49:09.447
And that's it.

00:49:10.407 --> 00:49:12.618
- It hasn't been that long.
- It's been three weeks.

00:49:12.993 --> 00:49:14.873
It's never taken him
more than a day to respond.

00:49:16.747 --> 00:49:17.915
I'm sure he's okay.

00:49:23.879 --> 00:49:25.089
Show me where the tower is.

00:49:26.715 --> 00:49:27.967
You can't be serious.

00:49:29.593 --> 00:49:31.595
Joel, it's in Wyoming.

00:49:32.763 --> 00:49:34.348
All this open country?

00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:36.475
You're a capable guy,

00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:38.894
but there are worse things
than Infected out there.

00:49:38.978 --> 00:49:40.729
I hear everything on this.

00:49:40.813 --> 00:49:42.731
There are raiders, there are slavers...

00:49:42.815 --> 00:49:44.733
But you're "sure" Tommy is okay?

00:49:52.032 --> 00:49:53.159
It's...

00:49:53.242 --> 00:49:54.743
It's the Cody Tower.

00:49:55.911 --> 00:49:58.706
Q-Bar 4,
but I don't know exactly where...

00:50:04.628 --> 00:50:05.628
Next!

00:51:51.318 --> 00:51:52.318
Joel!

00:52:50.419 --> 00:52:52.504
I got jumped by a couple guys.

00:52:52.838 --> 00:52:55.090
- What guys?
- Just a couple teenagers.

00:52:55.174 --> 00:52:57.176
Said some shit
I probably shouldn't have.

00:52:59.094 --> 00:53:01.472
Come on. You know these guys
were born after the outbreak.

00:53:01.555 --> 00:53:03.849
Never learned how to argue.
They just start swinging.

00:53:03.932 --> 00:53:05.976
Fucking 19-year-old pieces of shit.

00:53:07.311 --> 00:53:08.520
It's a miracle you're alive.

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:11.523
It's a miracle any of us are alive.

00:53:14.026 --> 00:53:15.026
These aren't new.

00:53:15.861 --> 00:53:16.861
No.

00:53:17.821 --> 00:53:20.449
I was in FEDRA lockup all day.

00:53:21.867 --> 00:53:22.907
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

00:53:24.495 --> 00:53:26.497
- I need you to take a breath.
- What?

00:53:29.249 --> 00:53:30.334
- Joel.
- What?

00:53:32.461 --> 00:53:34.630
The guys who jumped me were with Robert.

00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:36.757
He sold our battery to someone else.

00:53:38.384 --> 00:53:39.510
Nothing's lost.

00:53:39.593 --> 00:53:41.428
Shit like this is gonna happen.

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.222
Now we just shake it off,

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:45.891
and we go get our cards back
or the battery.

00:53:45.974 --> 00:53:47.601
I need the battery, Tess.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:49.686
The truck's no good without one

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:51.873
and if I don't get to Tommy soon,
he's gonna die out there!

00:53:51.897 --> 00:53:54.566
Okay, fuck it. We get our money back
and the battery.

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:55.818
But, Joel, listen.

00:53:56.193 --> 00:53:57.986
Robert is terrified of you.

00:53:58.070 --> 00:53:59.830
So, you march out of here
all Clint Eastwood,

00:53:59.863 --> 00:54:01.615
he's going to get wind of it and skip.

00:54:01.698 --> 00:54:03.992
I need you to take a breath.

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:10.916
Who'd he sell it to?

00:54:10.999 --> 00:54:12.584
- Don't know.
- Well, where is he?

00:54:12.668 --> 00:54:13.669
Don't know...

00:54:14.378 --> 00:54:15.378
...yet.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:19.049
But we're gonna find out quietly.

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:20.550
Understand?

00:54:22.052 --> 00:54:24.471
Now, I promised Robert
that you wouldn't hurt him.

00:54:25.597 --> 00:54:27.766
But I would very much like for you
to hurt him.

00:54:28.934 --> 00:54:31.228
So, let's go hunt that motherfucker down

00:54:31.895 --> 00:54:33.939
and get our battery and our truck.

00:54:34.565 --> 00:54:35.983
And then we'll go find Tommy.

00:54:36.942 --> 00:54:37.942
All right?

00:54:41.029 --> 00:54:42.029
All right.

00:55:05.637 --> 00:55:07.014
The team in place at Southeast 3?

00:55:08.765 --> 00:55:09.766
I held them back.

00:55:11.101 --> 00:55:12.186
I have some questions.

00:55:13.896 --> 00:55:14.896
Okay.

00:55:15.898 --> 00:55:17.978
We've been blowing up
meaningless FEDRA targets

00:55:18.025 --> 00:55:20.319
spread out all over the QZ
for two weeks.

00:55:20.402 --> 00:55:22.404
We've already lost four people,
and we're...

00:55:23.655 --> 00:55:24.656
What's the point of this?

00:55:26.283 --> 00:55:27.326
Is that your question?

00:55:28.076 --> 00:55:29.119
That's one of them.

00:55:29.786 --> 00:55:31.306
My answer is to follow fucking orders.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.200
And why do you have
some random girl locked in a room?

00:55:34.374 --> 00:55:36.752
And the guys you have guarding her
won't tell me shit.

00:55:36.835 --> 00:55:40.672
Our people are asking what's going on,
and I don't know what to tell them.

00:55:40.756 --> 00:55:42.424
Tell them to follow fucking orders.

00:55:42.841 --> 00:55:44.259
You two, go to Southeast 3. Now.

00:55:51.225 --> 00:55:53.018
- Kim.
- Marlene.

00:55:53.101 --> 00:55:55.729
We are in a war
against a military dictatorship

00:55:55.812 --> 00:55:58.607
to restore democracy and freedom.
Does that sound about right?

00:55:58.690 --> 00:55:59.900
- Yes.
- Are we winning?

00:55:59.983 --> 00:56:00.983
Are we beating FEDRA here?

00:56:00.984 --> 00:56:02.546
Are the Fireflies beating
FEDRA anywhere?

00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:03.737
Rebellion takes time.

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:06.260
If you fight 20 years and get nowhere,
you're not a rebellion.

00:56:06.657 --> 00:56:07.908
Just spray paint.

00:56:09.451 --> 00:56:11.537
We're not hitting FEDRA all over the QZ.

00:56:11.995 --> 00:56:15.541
We hit 'em here, here, here, here, here.

00:56:16.375 --> 00:56:17.459
Where are we right now?

00:56:19.545 --> 00:56:21.213
I want FEDRA everywhere but here.

00:56:22.005 --> 00:56:23.549
I want them as distracted as possible.

00:56:23.632 --> 00:56:27.135
Because tonight, every Firefly in Boston
is gonna gather in this building,

00:56:27.219 --> 00:56:29.429
and we are gonna leave
the QZ. Permanently.

00:56:30.722 --> 00:56:31.722
We're quitting?

00:56:31.723 --> 00:56:35.519
No, we're taking that random girl
locked in that room west.

00:56:37.604 --> 00:56:39.606
From our guy
in the radio tower in Salem.

00:56:48.365 --> 00:56:49.365
Is this real?

00:56:50.534 --> 00:56:51.577
I believe it is.

00:56:55.539 --> 00:56:56.539
Keep it quiet.

00:57:00.043 --> 00:57:01.043
Whatever you need.

00:57:01.878 --> 00:57:02.878
Whatever it takes.

00:57:03.422 --> 00:57:04.923
We'll get her where she needs to go.

00:57:34.494 --> 00:57:35.495
Hey, friend.

00:57:37.706 --> 00:57:39.106
Don't worry. I don't want anything.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.376
But if you're feeling lost...

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.962
You tell me to "Look for the light"
and I'll break your jaw.

00:57:54.556 --> 00:57:57.809
Well, I mean, it'd cost us
a couple of cards, but we got him.

00:57:58.685 --> 00:58:01.897
He's supposedly taking the battery
to a red-tagged building.

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.108
But get this,
the corner of Stillman and Cross.

00:58:05.609 --> 00:58:08.570
- The one Miguel used to use?
- Yeah, I'm thinking so.

00:58:08.654 --> 00:58:10.774
I mean, we can take the subway tunnel
under Haymarket,

00:58:10.822 --> 00:58:13.867
get into the building from below
and take Robert by surprise.

00:58:14.451 --> 00:58:15.744
Pay this fucker back.

00:58:24.127 --> 00:58:25.128
Come on.

00:58:30.634 --> 00:58:32.511
You fucker!

00:58:39.142 --> 00:58:41.061
One, two, three, four...

00:59:09.464 --> 00:59:10.632
You're not scared?

00:59:13.677 --> 00:59:14.886
Then unlock me.

00:59:15.554 --> 00:59:17.097
How about we start with "Thank you"?

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.390
For what?

00:59:18.473 --> 00:59:19.725
For saving your life.

00:59:20.267 --> 00:59:22.602
I am the one who told them
not to shoot you, if you recall.

00:59:31.111 --> 00:59:32.154
Why did you stop them?

00:59:33.363 --> 00:59:34.363
We'll get to that.

00:59:48.754 --> 00:59:50.881
So, Veronica...

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.300
how you feeling?

00:59:56.386 --> 00:59:57.386
The same.

00:59:59.639 --> 01:00:00.682
Is it gonna happen?

01:00:03.435 --> 01:00:04.435
No.

01:00:07.689 --> 01:00:08.815
So, can I go?

01:00:09.816 --> 01:00:10.859
No.

01:00:10.942 --> 01:00:13.612
I won't tell anyone
about any of this, I swear.

01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:15.071
Where you gonna go?

01:00:15.155 --> 01:00:18.074
Back to FEDRA military school?
You that anxious to be a soldier?

01:00:18.158 --> 01:00:19.534
You think I chose that place?

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.828
They put me there when I was a baby.

01:00:21.912 --> 01:00:23.205
It's for orphans.

01:00:23.288 --> 01:00:24.790
"They" didn't put you there.

01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:28.042
I did.

01:00:29.002 --> 01:00:30.045
Ellie.

01:00:33.965 --> 01:00:35.509
You my fucking mom or something?

01:00:36.176 --> 01:00:37.511
Do I look like your mom?

01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:40.639
No, you do not.

01:00:41.848 --> 01:00:42.974
My name is Marlene.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.685
I'm the leader of the Fireflies
in the Boston QZ.

01:00:47.312 --> 01:00:49.022
Why would a terrorist dump me
with FEDRA?

01:00:49.105 --> 01:00:50.500
Because it's where you'd be safest.

01:00:50.524 --> 01:00:52.585
And you were safe there
until you decided to sneak out.

01:00:52.609 --> 01:00:53.860
And "terrorist?"

01:00:54.945 --> 01:00:56.071
Was Riley a terrorist?

01:01:13.088 --> 01:01:14.798
Why won't you let me go home?

01:01:18.927 --> 01:01:22.055
Because you have a greater purpose
than any of us could have ever imagined.

01:01:23.306 --> 01:01:26.434
So, we're leaving tonight,
and we're taking you with us.

01:01:29.312 --> 01:01:30.772
- He's here.
- Five minutes.

01:01:35.986 --> 01:01:38.488
What I'm about to tell you
cannot be repeated to anyone.

01:01:39.197 --> 01:01:40.365
Because if you do,

01:01:41.116 --> 01:01:42.367
I assure you...

01:01:44.035 --> 01:01:45.161
you will die.

01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:09.019
Okay.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.020
Ready?

01:02:11.438 --> 01:02:12.439
Yeah.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.082
That's the one.

01:02:57.567 --> 01:02:58.610
Oh, shit!

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:01.820
This one's done.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.240
Yeah.

01:03:06.034 --> 01:03:08.286
I know, I just... I wasn't expecting it.

01:03:08.787 --> 01:03:10.547
Take it he wasn't down here
last time?

01:03:11.623 --> 01:03:12.623
No.

01:03:15.251 --> 01:03:17.087
You think he came down
after he was infected?

01:03:18.964 --> 01:03:21.341
Or maybe down here
is where he was infected.

01:03:26.429 --> 01:03:27.429
Let's keep moving.

01:03:42.153 --> 01:03:44.239
It's like they reframed
the whole structure.

01:03:44.698 --> 01:03:46.032
Probably in the '80s.

01:03:46.116 --> 01:03:47.993
Everyone was cutting down
on apartment sizes

01:03:48.076 --> 01:03:49.285
to sell more condos.

01:03:49.369 --> 01:03:54.499
Oh. "This has been
Construction Corner with Joel Miller."

01:03:54.582 --> 01:03:55.750
How far up are we going?

01:03:55.834 --> 01:03:57.085
Uh,

01:03:58.461 --> 01:03:59.587
this far.

01:04:02.382 --> 01:04:06.094
So, this opens into the hallway.

01:04:07.303 --> 01:04:10.181
What the fuck?
Someone put a piano in front of this?

01:04:13.268 --> 01:04:14.352
You smell that?

01:04:16.521 --> 01:04:18.356
Yeah, gunpowder.

01:04:24.654 --> 01:04:25.697
Tess.

01:04:47.552 --> 01:04:48.845
Well, the battery's no good.

01:04:49.679 --> 01:04:51.306
And he still tried to sell it.

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:53.433
Twice.

01:04:54.184 --> 01:04:55.769
You greedy fuck.

01:05:06.112 --> 01:05:07.697
Just fucking help me up.

01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:11.326
Shit.

01:05:12.243 --> 01:05:13.201
God.

01:05:13.203 --> 01:05:14.621
Just... Okay.

01:05:15.538 --> 01:05:17.707
Shit, come on.

01:05:24.923 --> 01:05:25.924
Fuck.

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:29.594
Joel?

01:05:30.887 --> 01:05:33.181
Marlene?

01:05:33.807 --> 01:05:34.723
You okay?

01:05:34.724 --> 01:05:35.810
Yeah.

01:05:38.353 --> 01:05:39.354
Ellie.

01:05:39.854 --> 01:05:40.939
Ellie!

01:05:43.441 --> 01:05:44.357
Oh, shit!

01:05:44.359 --> 01:05:46.039
No, it's okay.
I'll be all right.

01:05:46.361 --> 01:05:48.363
And you can't be stupid like this.

01:05:49.823 --> 01:05:52.283
So this is who Robert screwed us
over with?

01:05:52.367 --> 01:05:54.244
The Che Guevara of Boston?

01:05:54.327 --> 01:05:56.013
I mean, war must be going
pretty shitty for you

01:05:56.037 --> 01:05:57.580
to be buying from scumbags like him.

01:05:57.664 --> 01:05:58.915
Yeah, it kinda has been.

01:05:58.998 --> 01:06:00.333
The merch was bad,

01:06:00.542 --> 01:06:02.269
and he obviously didn't take
"fuck off" for an answer.

01:06:02.293 --> 01:06:04.533
- Give me my knife.
- What do you need a car battery for?

01:06:05.255 --> 01:06:06.506
- Don't.
- Not at her.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.800
Point it at me.

01:06:23.523 --> 01:06:25.793
And to answer your question, I need it
for a better reason than you do.

01:06:25.817 --> 01:06:27.694
No offense, but Tommy's just one man.

01:06:28.862 --> 01:06:31.072
- It's our business to know things.
- "To know things."

01:06:31.865 --> 01:06:34.218
You're the cause of it.
You turned my own brother against me.

01:06:34.242 --> 01:06:35.719
- Okay, Joel.
- That was a lot of gunfire.

01:06:35.743 --> 01:06:37.453
- FEDRA's gonna be on the way.
- I know.

01:06:42.876 --> 01:06:44.796
We were gonna move Ellie
out of the zone tonight.

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.839
But we won't make it anywhere like this.
Not for a while anyway.

01:06:47.922 --> 01:06:49.507
So now I'm thinking...

01:06:50.717 --> 01:06:51.633
you're gonna do it.

01:06:51.634 --> 01:06:52.696
- The hell we are.
- I'm not going with them!

01:06:52.719 --> 01:06:54.864
- Let me take her.
- Tess, we don't have time for this.

01:06:54.888 --> 01:06:56.448
- Oh, you don't have time?
- Who is she?

01:06:56.472 --> 01:06:58.325
- To you? She's cargo.
- We don't smuggle people.

01:06:58.349 --> 01:06:59.475
- Sorry.
- I can do it.

01:06:59.559 --> 01:07:01.579
Kim, you don't have a fucking ear
on your fucking head.

01:07:01.603 --> 01:07:02.603
Could you please?

01:07:04.189 --> 01:07:06.858
There's a team of Fireflies waiting
for her at the old Statehouse.

01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:08.651
I know what's out there.

01:07:08.735 --> 01:07:11.696
We were going with an entire squadron
for that very reason.

01:07:11.779 --> 01:07:13.591
But now I don't have a truck,
I don't have a squadron,

01:07:13.615 --> 01:07:16.367
FEDRA's five minutes away.
What I do have is you.

01:07:17.327 --> 01:07:18.995
And I know what you're both capable of.

01:07:19.704 --> 01:07:21.122
For better or worse.

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:25.543
What are they capable of?

01:07:25.627 --> 01:07:28.421
You get her there safely,
and they'll give you what you need.

01:07:28.504 --> 01:07:30.340
Not just a battery. The whole thing.

01:07:30.423 --> 01:07:32.759
Fueled up truck, guns,
supplies, all of it.

01:07:33.176 --> 01:07:34.176
I swear.

01:07:37.305 --> 01:07:38.389
I swear.

01:07:46.397 --> 01:07:47.482
Asshole!

01:07:53.404 --> 01:07:54.405
You trust her?

01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:57.033
No, me neither, but she seems desperate.

01:07:57.116 --> 01:07:59.702
Firefly vehicle usually means
repurposed FEDRA stuff.

01:07:59.786 --> 01:08:02.223
So better than a decent chance
of making it to Tommy in one of those.

01:08:02.247 --> 01:08:04.642
- The second we hand that kid over...
- Y'all talk it through,

01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:06.459
but please remember
that I'm bleeding out.

01:08:10.922 --> 01:08:12.340
Okay. Here's the deal.

01:08:13.466 --> 01:08:15.226
We'll get her to your crew
at the Statehouse.

01:08:15.593 --> 01:08:18.638
But before we hand her over,
they give us everything that we want.

01:08:18.721 --> 01:08:20.515
If not, we kill her. There and then.

01:08:20.598 --> 01:08:22.725
- Deal.
- Really? That fast?

01:08:23.184 --> 01:08:25.937
You are all that matters.
My team will not jeopardize that.

01:08:26.437 --> 01:08:27.605
Remember what I told you?

01:08:28.064 --> 01:08:29.065
Now go get your backpack.

01:08:30.525 --> 01:08:32.151
Now, Ellie.

01:08:42.537 --> 01:08:43.579
Let's go.

01:08:51.462 --> 01:08:52.463
Joel.

01:08:54.966 --> 01:08:56.009
Don't fuck this up.

01:08:58.803 --> 01:08:59.803
Please.

01:09:51.272 --> 01:09:52.440
Give us a minute, all right?

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:54.108
What the fuck...

01:09:55.777 --> 01:09:56.944
So, what's the plan?

01:09:58.654 --> 01:10:00.094
There's not a lot of options.

01:10:00.448 --> 01:10:02.241
There's the short way
or the long way.

01:10:02.575 --> 01:10:03.826
The short way is pretty much...

01:10:04.869 --> 01:10:06.149
That leaves the long way.

01:10:06.829 --> 01:10:08.748
Things look bad,
we'll come up with something.

01:10:08.831 --> 01:10:10.625
We have to drop,
head to Bill and Frank's.

01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:12.668
Stock up on anything we may need.

01:10:28.643 --> 01:10:31.729
We leave after dark.
Stay with the kid.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.000
Wait. Why do I have to... Tess!

01:10:44.575 --> 01:10:46.119
So, who's Bill and Frank?

01:10:49.747 --> 01:10:51.207
The radio's a smuggling code, right?

01:10:51.833 --> 01:10:53.433
60's song, they don't have anything new.

01:10:53.501 --> 01:10:54.836
70's, they got new stuff.

01:10:54.919 --> 01:10:56.087
What's 80's?

01:11:03.136 --> 01:11:05.346
- What are you doing?
- Killing time.

01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:07.870
- What am I supposed to do?
- I'm sure you'll figure that out.

01:11:15.857 --> 01:11:16.941
Your watch is broken.

01:11:32.748 --> 01:11:34.125
You mumble in your sleep.

01:11:42.216 --> 01:11:44.093
I've never been on the other side
of the wall.

01:11:45.761 --> 01:11:46.971
Look how dark it is.

01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:55.646
You guys go out there a lot?

01:11:57.106 --> 01:11:58.983
- I guess.
- When was the last time?

01:11:59.567 --> 01:12:00.818
Maybe a year. What's it matter?

01:12:00.902 --> 01:12:02.222
But you know where to go.

01:12:03.696 --> 01:12:04.947
So we're gonna be okay.

01:12:09.994 --> 01:12:10.994
Yeah.

01:12:18.503 --> 01:12:19.730
So what's the deal with you anyway?

01:12:19.754 --> 01:12:21.554
You some kinda bigwig's daughter
or something?

01:12:23.841 --> 01:12:25.009
Something like that.

01:12:34.852 --> 01:12:36.479
The radio came on
when you were sleeping.

01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:39.357
What? What was the song?

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.483
He kept saying like,

01:12:40.816 --> 01:12:42.860
"Wake me up before you go-go"?

01:12:44.195 --> 01:12:45.196
Shit.

01:12:46.489 --> 01:12:47.489
Gotcha.

01:12:47.949 --> 01:12:50.034
80's means trouble.

01:12:50.952 --> 01:12:52.453
Code broken.

01:12:55.623 --> 01:12:56.863
Listen...

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.382
The spot under Lancaster looks good.

01:13:05.049 --> 01:13:06.926
- You got a jacket in your pack?
- Yeah.

01:13:07.009 --> 01:13:08.970
Okay, get it. It's time to go.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.001
...mandatory curfew

01:13:23.025 --> 01:13:25.528
to fight the infection and insurrection.

01:13:28.489 --> 01:13:30.700
Observe mandatory curfew

01:13:30.783 --> 01:13:33.494
to fight infection and insurrection.

01:14:22.585 --> 01:14:25.254
Holy shit. I'm actually outside.

01:14:25.338 --> 01:14:26.756
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, shit.

01:14:29.925 --> 01:14:32.970
Okay, we're gonna take
the left edge around the buffer zone.

01:14:33.596 --> 01:14:35.640
You stay close and you follow my lead.

01:14:36.557 --> 01:14:37.557
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

01:14:39.101 --> 01:14:40.101
Let's go.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.361
What the hell?

01:16:12.445 --> 01:16:14.071
Hey! Don't move.

01:16:15.823 --> 01:16:16.866
Don't move!

01:16:23.205 --> 01:16:24.205
You gotta be shitting me.

01:16:24.874 --> 01:16:26.709
- Okay, let's talk this out.
- Turn around.

01:16:26.792 --> 01:16:28.919
- Hold on...
- Get on your fucking knees.

01:16:29.003 --> 01:16:30.647
- Now hold on...
- What did I fucking tell you, man?

01:16:30.671 --> 01:16:33.299
I said stay the fuck home.
Get on your knees!

01:16:34.216 --> 01:16:36.010
Just get on your knees.

01:16:36.093 --> 01:16:38.471
Listen, you let us do this run,

01:16:38.929 --> 01:16:40.389
we'll split the cards with you.

01:16:40.473 --> 01:16:41.640
- Oh, will you?
- Yeah.

01:16:41.724 --> 01:16:44.518
I'm so blessed.
Hands on your head. Eyes forward.

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.520
Hands on your head!

01:16:50.107 --> 01:16:52.568
- Really, man?
- Yep. We're doing this by the book.

01:16:53.736 --> 01:16:54.904
Jesus Christ.

01:16:55.362 --> 01:16:56.864
All right. What about three-quarters?

01:16:58.365 --> 01:17:00.493
Unauthorized exit.
They'll hang you for that.

01:17:00.576 --> 01:17:02.411
Fine. Everything off of this run,

01:17:02.495 --> 01:17:04.789
- and half off on all of the pills.
- Half off?

01:17:05.456 --> 01:17:06.456
All off.

01:17:06.457 --> 01:17:09.543
Risk my job for half off.
Out of your fucking mind.

01:17:09.627 --> 01:17:11.712
Ellie! Ellie, what the...

01:17:11.796 --> 01:17:13.172
Fucking bitch!

01:17:15.299 --> 01:17:17.301
- Get out of the fucking way!
- Whoa. Whoa.

01:17:19.136 --> 01:17:20.137
We can fix this.

01:17:20.846 --> 01:17:21.846
Move.

01:17:25.976 --> 01:17:27.061
Move.

01:18:04.682 --> 01:18:06.308
No, no! No, I'm not sick!

01:18:06.392 --> 01:18:08.894
- Joel! Joel!
- I am not sick!

01:18:08.978 --> 01:18:11.730
Look! Look! This is three weeks old.

01:18:11.814 --> 01:18:13.148
Nobody lasts more than a day!

01:18:13.232 --> 01:18:14.900
Does this look a day old to you?

01:18:15.651 --> 01:18:17.671
- You would've killed me!
- I should fucking kill you!

01:18:17.695 --> 01:18:18.946
When did it happen?

01:18:19.029 --> 01:18:20.909
It doesn't matter.
You have to trust me!

01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:23.409
They're gonna catch us if we don't run!

01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:26.245
Joel, we gotta move.

01:18:26.579 --> 01:18:28.205
We gotta move, Joel!

01:18:40.509 --> 01:18:41.552
Joel!

01:19:33.103 --> 01:19:36.607
I'm taking a ride with my best friend

01:19:40.903 --> 01:19:45.658
I hope he never lets me down again

01:19:49.995 --> 01:19:53.958
He knows where he's taking me

01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:58.462
Taking me where I want to be

01:19:59.004 --> 01:20:03.801
I'm taking a ride with my best friend

01:20:17.106 --> 01:20:19.817
We're flying high

01:20:20.192 --> 01:20:24.321
We're watching the world pass us by

01:20:26.782 --> 01:20:28.909
Never want to come down

01:20:28.993 --> 01:20:33.163
Never want to put my feet back
Down on the ground
