00:01.390 --> 00:04.360
So <i>this</i> is the Miburo's headquarters?

00:05.370 --> 00:07.620
Yagi-san is putting us up in his compound.

00:07.930 --> 00:10.080
You'll eat and sleep here, too.

00:11.080 --> 00:15.500
Come to think of it, I heard the
 local kids talking about this place.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.820
Huh? What did they say about it?

00:20.270 --> 00:21.660
"Demons live there."

00:23.880 --> 00:25.210
Meaning us.

00:27.780 --> 00:30.630
Honestly, Hijikata-san. 
Don't scare him like that.

00:31.210 --> 00:33.800
So, um, where is everyone?

00:33.800 --> 00:35.880
I think Yagi-san's at a meeting.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.260
Wait in the yard.

00:38.990 --> 00:41.480
<i>Granny. Iroha.</i>

00:42.320 --> 00:46.530
<i>I think this place might be bad news.</i>

A-Are you hurt?

02:36.930 --> 02:37.880
Not good enough!

02:38.320 --> 02:40.030
You'll have to do better, Sanosuke!

02:40.030 --> 02:44.300

02:48.870 --> 02:49.680
Huh?

02:50.990 --> 02:54.320
Hey! Who're you? 
You can't just wander in here!

02:54.320 --> 02:55.920
Oh, um, I'm...

02:56.200 --> 02:57.360
He's a new recruit.

02:58.990 --> 03:00.140
He's one of us.

03:01.110 --> 03:02.620
A new recruit?

03:02.620 --> 03:05.200
Are you screwing with us, Hijikata?

03:05.200 --> 03:09.040
This ain't no game! I won't stand for it!

03:09.040 --> 03:11.660
You're the one messing around, Sanosuke.

03:11.660 --> 03:15.370
Go wash your face and cool your head, idiot.

03:15.570 --> 03:20.000
Soji, I've had it with 
these pranks of yours.

03:20.480 --> 03:25.130
Are you sure you want to do this?
It doesn't pay to take me lightly, Nagakura-san.

03:25.130 --> 03:27.900
You're the one getting cocky here!

03:25.130 --> 03:27.900
Quit your yapping.

03:27.900 --> 03:31.130
<i>O-Oh no. This is turning into a brawl.</i>

03:31.130 --> 03:33.260
Fine! We'll sumo wrestle to settle it!

03:34.150 --> 03:35.330
Fine by me.

03:35.330 --> 03:36.900
Show me what you're made of!

03:36.900 --> 03:38.240
Make it a best-of-three!

03:38.240 --> 03:40.030
Now you're talking!

03:40.580 --> 03:44.520
<i>Huh? Sumo wrestle? Wh-Why that?</i>

03:45.780 --> 03:48.780
Sorry. You see how it is.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.400
I'll referee, then.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.570
We're taking Hajime!

03:53.080 --> 03:54.520
Huh? Why me?

03:54.520 --> 03:56.230
We need a kid to fight a kid.

03:56.230 --> 03:57.990
Don't treat me like a kid!

03:57.990 --> 04:01.040
See what I mean? What a child.

04:07.190 --> 04:09.200
Chirinu Nio accepts your challenge!

04:09.780 --> 04:12.370
Now <i>that's</i> what I call maturity.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.770
I-I'll take you on!

04:15.770 --> 04:17.600
Loser has to run laps. Got that?

04:17.930 --> 04:20.290
You'd better not lose, Nio!

04:20.290 --> 04:20.880
Yes, sir!

04:22.160 --> 04:25.110
All right. If you lose, I'll run with you.

04:25.670 --> 04:26.640
He's still in the ring!

04:26.640 --> 04:28.190
Loser doesn't get dinner!

04:28.190 --> 04:29.120
Crush 'em!

04:29.550 --> 04:30.600
Whoa!

04:30.600 --> 04:32.410
That boy's tougher than he looks!

04:32.410 --> 04:33.960
Grab his belt, Nio!

04:33.960 --> 04:35.530
Trip him, Hajime!

04:38.630 --> 04:39.740
Who won?

04:38.630 --> 04:39.740
Who won?

04:42.390 --> 04:44.100
A tie! It's a tie!

04:44.840 --> 04:45.470
Damn it.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.330
One more round.

04:50.060 --> 04:50.930
Aw, crap.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.890
Huh? What?

04:57.580 --> 04:59.690
How could you wrestle without me?

05:02.370 --> 05:03.730
Whoa! Here he comes!

05:03.730 --> 05:04.960
Somebody stop him!

05:04.960 --> 05:06.370
He'll throw us all!

05:07.340 --> 05:08.450
I'll take you on!

05:09.840 --> 05:11.010
Alas!

05:11.450 --> 05:14.590
Hey, asshole! Don't underestimate me!

05:16.880 --> 05:18.240
He even got Sano!

05:18.680 --> 05:19.530
It's hopeless.

05:19.530 --> 05:21.070
H-He's too strong.

05:24.270 --> 05:25.520
Sir Kondo!

05:25.520 --> 05:30.340
I, Serizawa Kamo, shall be your opponent.

05:41.020 --> 05:42.440
He has <i>ten</i> arms?!

05:44.920 --> 05:47.400
Face the Serizawa Five!

05:47.400 --> 05:50.400
They're just standing behind him!

05:50.400 --> 05:53.980
We may have five faces, 
but our hearts beat as one!

05:55.610 --> 05:57.660
You scared, Kondo?

06:01.960 --> 06:03.740
All together now!

06:19.850 --> 06:20.530
Look.

06:20.530 --> 06:21.360
There he goes.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.860

08:06.600 --> 08:08.570
I don't know much about these things,

08:09.260 --> 08:13.290
but is it always bad people who get killed 
and good people who do the killing?

08:14.790 --> 08:19.330
Do people who are trying to make the
 world better really do things like this?

08:23.860 --> 08:26.510
Extremists have been 
frequenting a particular inn.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.750
We raid it tonight.

08:51.210 --> 08:53.310
Are you really sure, Nio?

08:53.510 --> 08:56.240
Y-Yes, sir. I want to know.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.270
I want to find out 
what's happening in Kyoto.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.270
All right. Stay behind us.

09:05.750 --> 09:06.360

09:08.440 --> 09:11.280

09:15.630 --> 09:19.400

09:29.760 --> 09:31.400
Die!

09:39.420 --> 09:40.290
<i>He killed him.</i>

09:40.290 --> 09:41.610
<i>He actually killed him!</i>

09:45.680 --> 09:46.600
<i>Okita-san.</i>

09:51.070 --> 09:53.060
Th-This wasn't the deal!

09:53.950 --> 09:54.810
What deal?

09:55.120 --> 09:59.400
W-We just had to off this one bad guy.
Easy money, they said.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.830
We were supposed to get 
our fill of wine and women.

10:05.140 --> 10:07.830
It's refreshing to see 
such a shameless scumbag.

10:08.110 --> 10:09.560
W-Wait!

10:09.830 --> 10:13.590
I just tossed the dead guy's ear 
into the house they told me to!

10:14.350 --> 10:16.210
I just learned something new.

10:16.590 --> 10:22.350
So, without righteousness or conviction, 
people can end up like you, huh?

10:36.400 --> 10:38.480
Ahem, Hijikata-san.

10:39.420 --> 10:41.720
Think about where the blood's spattering.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.110
Be quiet.

10:47.290 --> 10:49.920
We'd better hurry home 
so you can have a bath.

11:19.690 --> 11:20.680
Can't sleep?

11:22.700 --> 11:25.620
Did you want them to live, 
however vile they were?

11:25.840 --> 11:28.560
Huh? Oh, no.

11:29.360 --> 11:33.080
Anyone who kills for money needs to pay.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.880
So what's bothering you?

11:36.420 --> 11:39.400
Nothing's bothering me, exactly. 
I was just thinking.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.330
Oh? What about?

11:41.950 --> 11:44.520
What if someone 
I'm supposed to kill is like me?

11:45.150 --> 11:47.390
What if they also want to 
make the world a better place?

11:48.250 --> 11:51.360
What should I do then?

11:54.320 --> 12:00.460
Hijikata-san, I always thought there 
were bad people who steal and kill,

12:00.460 --> 12:02.990
and good people who try to stop them,

12:03.430 --> 12:06.300
and that was why Kyoto is such a mess.

12:10.520 --> 12:14.950
But it's not really good versus evil, is it?

12:15.330 --> 12:19.670
Good people are fighting 
each other until it rains blood.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.220
No one's evil to start with.

12:25.780 --> 12:31.880
At least, almost no one thinks 
that they could be the bad guy.

12:32.790 --> 12:35.350
What should I do?

12:35.920 --> 12:36.820
Huh?

12:36.820 --> 12:40.160
How can I learn to act 
like you and Okita-san?

12:42.200 --> 12:44.380
That's simple, Nio.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.990
Have principles you'll never compromise on.

12:49.420 --> 12:54.680
If nothing and no one can 
take them from you...

12:56.170 --> 12:58.260
that's your idea of justice.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.830
As long as you have that, 
you can cut down anyone you need to.

13:06.400 --> 13:09.310
Damn, I'm sleepy. Time for some shut-eye.

13:15.530 --> 13:17.720
<i>I see. I get it now.</i>

13:18.330 --> 13:21.010
<i>The faint smell that clings to this house...</i>

13:23.180 --> 13:24.130
<i>is blood.</i>

13:24.970 --> 13:26.200
<i>It smells like blood.</i>

13:28.380 --> 13:30.270
<i>I don't know anything yet.</i>

13:31.090 --> 13:35.490
<i>I need to see and think about many more things
 so that I can make up my own mind.</i>

13:38.020 --> 13:39.560
<i>What is justice?</i>

13:40.440 --> 13:43.410
<i>What's right? What can't I give up?</i>

13:45.490 --> 13:47.640
<i>For as long as I live, I'll keep on wondering...</i>

13:48.820 --> 13:52.220
<i>until I find what I think is right.</i>

13:58.080 --> 14:00.680
Something on your mind, Nio-kun?

14:01.070 --> 14:05.810
Oh, Okita-san. Yeah, I guess. 
I was wondering what justice is.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.680
Oh, justice, huh?

14:08.370 --> 14:09.570
Do you know?

14:10.240 --> 14:12.360
You have to figure it out for yourself.

14:14.450 --> 14:16.030
R-Right.

14:17.050 --> 14:19.820
It's not something someone can teach you.

14:19.820 --> 14:24.070
Oh, that reminds me. I haven't paid
 my respects to the Yagi family.

14:24.070 --> 14:28.820
Gennojo-san just stepped out. 
You'll run into him sooner or later.

14:28.820 --> 14:32.270
You really don't stand on 
ceremony, do you, Okita-san?

14:34.260 --> 14:36.310
That's <i>my</i> justice.

14:36.860 --> 14:38.010
Good one, right?

14:38.440 --> 14:40.420
Nio! Get over here now!

14:40.420 --> 14:44.440
Oh, that reminds me. 
Hijikata-san wants to see you.

14:44.810 --> 14:45.830
What?

14:45.830 --> 14:48.230
O-On my way, sir!

14:49.720 --> 14:52.010
The three of us are going on patrol.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.040
Patrol, sir? You can count on me.

14:56.790 --> 14:58.400
Wait, the <i>three</i> of us?

15:00.870 --> 15:02.300
Kondo-san.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.720
I-I don't think we've been 
properly introduced. I'm Nio.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.300
It's a pleasure to serve with you.

15:07.620 --> 15:10.130
Indeed. Kondo Isami is my name.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.100
The pleasure's mine.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.790
Th-Thank you, sir.

15:24.560 --> 15:30.070
Give me a break. You won't last 
an hour like that. Try to relax.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.060
Uh, yes, sir.

15:32.550 --> 15:36.570
I thought Kyoto would be 
full of simpering bluebloods,

15:37.110 --> 15:41.080
but I see plenty of samurai 
wearing proper sets of swords, too.

15:41.410 --> 15:47.040
The lord of Aizu led a thousand troops 
to the city in the twelfth month last year.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.100
It seems like there have been 
lots more samurai ever since.

15:50.100 --> 15:53.590
Oh? In that case, Kyoto is
as fine a place as they say.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.280
I'm glad I came here, Toshi.

15:57.610 --> 15:59.290
It's good having you here, Nio.

15:59.910 --> 16:03.720
Three of you locals have joined up now. 
We can use your expertise.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.900
Oh, no, I don't know anything that...

16:07.240 --> 16:09.880
Wait, that reminds me. 
Who are the other two?

16:09.450 --> 16:09.880
Look.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.080
Follow him.

16:14.750 --> 16:15.360
Yes, sir!

16:19.740 --> 16:22.220
<i>H-He's so fast. Well, he </i>is<i> an adult, I suppose.</i>

16:23.800 --> 16:24.750
<i>Why's </i>he<i> so slow?</i>

16:24.750 --> 16:26.840
Forget about me! Don't let him get away!

16:27.090 --> 16:28.330
Y-Yes, sir.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.920
He must have run down there.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.920
This area is full of narrow alleys.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.390
We'd better split up.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.410
I'll go left.

16:42.630 --> 16:44.620
Kondo-san, you go straight ahead.

16:44.620 --> 16:45.600
Nio, take the right.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.600
Shout your head off if you find him.

16:47.820 --> 16:48.350
Yes, sir.

16:51.470 --> 16:55.530
<i>I don't know what that guy did, 
but cornered people can turn dangerous.</i>

16:59.800 --> 17:00.840
<i>A kid?</i>

17:01.190 --> 17:03.450
<i>But she's outside of our search area.</i>

17:12.360 --> 17:13.180
Are you okay?

17:17.200 --> 17:17.770
Come here.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.520
You don't have to say anything.

17:27.710 --> 17:28.840
Here. For you.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.080
You must really care about these sandals. 
Did your big sister give them to you?

17:35.080 --> 17:36.810
Yeah. Thanks.

17:36.810 --> 17:39.320
You're welcome. Can you get home on your own?

17:41.160 --> 17:42.480
Murderer!

17:43.730 --> 17:44.830
He ran for it!

17:53.880 --> 17:54.720
Nio!

17:54.720 --> 17:56.920
Out of my way!

18:07.230 --> 18:08.310
It'll be all right.

18:10.790 --> 18:14.950
Curse that man. No real samurai 
would turn and run like that.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.870
But he won't get far. 
Toshi can run like the devil.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.430
Does no one in Kyoto know how to fight?

18:47.840 --> 18:49.200
I'm sorry, sir.

18:49.790 --> 18:52.000
Huh? What for?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.980
I ignored orders.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.640
And then I ran away.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.530
Oh, right. You shielded that girl.

19:00.110 --> 19:03.250
I saw a child crying. 
I couldn't just leave her.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.280
I was so frantic to protect her.

19:09.800 --> 19:13.600
I heard that both my parents were murdered.

19:14.870 --> 19:16.640
You "heard"?

19:16.850 --> 19:21.240
Oh, a temple took me in when 
I was still too young to remember.

19:21.810 --> 19:24.550
I think they had about ten kids like me.

19:26.070 --> 19:29.560
We were taught to hold back
 our tears and smiles.

19:30.580 --> 19:31.560
Why?

19:31.980 --> 19:34.060
Because they wouldn't get adopted otherwise.

19:34.060 --> 19:37.030
Yes, sir. I think they were right about that.

19:37.800 --> 19:41.120
Thanks to that advice, 
I got to live with Granny and my sister.

19:42.760 --> 19:46.400
But I think, deep down, I wanted to cry.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.880
I wanted someone to hold me tight 
while I cried my eyes out.

19:55.230 --> 20:00.840
I left home spouting a lot of big talk 
about wanting to make the world better.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.080
But in truth...

20:05.410 --> 20:09.520
I just want a world 
where kids feel safe to cry.

20:11.240 --> 20:14.730
And I'd like to be there 
for them when they do.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.480
I want a world where that can happen.

20:22.190 --> 20:26.960
I'm sorry. I didn't help at all. I'm a disgrace.

20:29.880 --> 20:30.890
Full marks.

20:30.890 --> 20:31.350
Huh?

20:32.340 --> 20:35.200
You helped that girl. 
I couldn't have asked for more.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.570
R-Really, sir?

20:38.900 --> 20:39.720
Yes.

20:41.380 --> 20:42.940
That was the right thing to do?

20:44.500 --> 20:45.360
It was.

20:49.820 --> 20:51.890
<i>I'll never forget...</i>

20:53.620 --> 20:56.640
Looks like you <i>do</i> know 
what justice means to you.

20:57.760 --> 21:02.980
<i>...what Hijikata-san said to me, 
or how big Kondo-san seemed in that moment.</i>

21:05.240 --> 21:07.140
Welcome to the Miburo.

21:14.510 --> 21:19.380
<i>But back then, I had no way of knowing...</i>

21:24.650 --> 21:27.000
Y-You played me...

21:32.450 --> 21:34.790
Serizawa.

21:37.810 --> 21:41.130
<i>...that the Miburo's first purge had begun.</i>

21:44.910 --> 21:49.910
<b>A World
Where</b>

21:44.910 --> 21:49.910
<b>It's Okay
 to Cry</b>

23:20.040 --> 23:25.460
<b>Next time</b>

23:23.310 --> 23:27.210
I'm Chirinu Nio, and my life with
 the Miburo has only just begun.

23:27.600 --> 23:31.030
I do get lonely living away 
from Granny and Iroha,

23:31.380 --> 23:33.950
but everyone here is fun
 to be around, so I can handle it.

23:34.720 --> 23:38.040
Something's been bothering me, though.

23:38.770 --> 23:42.500
It's about another boy my age 
named Tanaka Taro-kun.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.610
Next time: "Where the Soul Dwells."

23:45.920 --> 23:47.070
It won't disappoint!

23:47.070 --> 23:49.900
<b>Where 
the</b>

23:47.070 --> 23:49.900
<b>Soul 
Dwells</b>
