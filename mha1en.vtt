WEBVTT

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.669
How many days has it been
since I last did laundry?

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.797
Izuku Midoriya

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:24.925
is trying to fulfill the responsibility
that comes with his power,

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.095
but he's just a regular
high school student

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.556
who still has a lot to learn!

00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:32.224
Please

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.813
continue to let this place
be his Hero Academia!

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:42.818
I was really

00:00:43.903 --> 00:00:44.862
able to come back.

00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:52.203
Don't get too fixated on it.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:55.581
Sometimes killing is what's merciful.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.418
Don't forget that.

00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:03.839
Maybe killing him is the only way
to stop him,

00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:07.259
and I don't even know exactly
what I need to do.

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.596
But I want to save him!

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:15.059
The battle is drawing close.

00:01:16.852 --> 00:01:19.605
But surprisingly, I feel no fear.

00:01:24.944 --> 00:01:26.779
Together, all of us
will bring it all back.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.831
We will overcome despair

00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:38.916
and go beyond.

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.252
To the future.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.801
{\an8}ORIGINAL STORY BY KOHEI HORIKOSHI

00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:34.865
I'm here now in Japan's biggest city,
Tokyo.

00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:38.369
{\an8}As you can see, the city is down,

00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:42.414
and other cities have received
similar damage.

00:03:43.332 --> 00:03:45.835
The group behind the recent incidents
in Japan

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:48.420
is an organization called
the Paranormal Liberation Front.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:50.339
{\an8}The leader

00:03:50.422 --> 00:03:53.342
{\an8}is the infamous symbol of evil,
All For One,

00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:56.887
{\an8}and his successor, Tomura Shigaraki.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.476
They released convicts
who were imprisoned nationwide.

00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:05.479
{\an8}The villains who escaped from prison

00:04:05.563 --> 00:04:08.065
{\an8}have been inflicting
heavy damage to the city.

00:04:08.941 --> 00:04:12.236
Heroes in Japan
are working with the police

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.071
to capture the convicts,

00:04:14.864 --> 00:04:17.032
but they are overwhelmingly outnumbered.

00:04:17.116 --> 00:04:19.076
Therefore, the Japanese government

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.495
is requesting help from heroes worldwide...

00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:24.498
{\an8}What are you doing?

00:04:24.582 --> 00:04:26.625
{\an8}Oh, I'm...

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:28.794
{\an8}reporting the state of this country.

00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:31.630
{\an8}You've no right to do that, foreigner.

00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:35.467
{\an8}Is it fun to stick your nose
into other people's problems?

00:04:36.135 --> 00:04:37.428
That little!

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:39.722
Have we received orders to assist?

00:04:39.805 --> 00:04:42.725
Not yet. The incidents unfolding in Japan

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.228
have invigorated villains worldwide
to take action.

00:04:46.896 --> 00:04:48.731
The situation is urgent,

00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:51.233
and the White House is being cautious.

00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:52.735
Damn it.

00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:54.570
We have the means

00:04:54.653 --> 00:04:57.406
to send heroes to Japan
in just two to three hours!

00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:58.532
Then...

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:04.747
will you take me, Bros?

00:05:05.664 --> 00:05:06.749
Star...

00:05:11.045 --> 00:05:13.631
You better take responsibility
for this, Star.

00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:15.966
I'm going, and that's a fact.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.385
It's just a matter of speed right now.

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:19.720
Plus,

00:05:19.803 --> 00:05:22.139
it's a personal request from All Might.

00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:24.600
Master is in trouble.

00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:27.603
Why in the world would I hesitate to help?

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.571
This is a crucial moment.

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:42.326
Thanks to the havoc
wreaked by the escaped prisoners,

00:05:42.993 --> 00:05:46.163
the police and heroes are busy
dealing with them

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:49.124
and can't give
their undivided attention to us.

00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:52.670
We have won the game of hide-and-seek

00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:54.630
on this small island of a country.

00:05:55.798 --> 00:05:57.633
We could've won by leaving
the country too.

00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:00.928
That's a different premise.

00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:04.139
Winning the game of hide-and-seek
was just a short-term goal.

00:06:04.223 --> 00:06:07.685
Gaining possession of One For All

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:09.269
is the mid-term goal.

00:06:09.353 --> 00:06:11.313
That's not the final goal?

00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:15.693
I have planned for a very long life.

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:17.361
And right now,

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:20.656
I'm simultaneously facing
the greatest challenge

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:23.409
and greatest opportunity of my life.

00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:29.665
I have many friends worldwide.

00:06:29.748 --> 00:06:31.750
All Might may have eradicated

00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:34.294
organized crime here in Japan,

00:06:34.378 --> 00:06:37.423
but it's a whole different story
in other countries.

00:06:37.923 --> 00:06:39.758
Once I get them to wreak havoc,

00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:41.802
all countries will inevitably

00:06:41.885 --> 00:06:45.222
have to decide whether
to protect themselves or others.

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:47.725
What's the challenge and opportunity
you mentioned?

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:49.852
Star and Stripe.

00:06:50.602 --> 00:06:52.896
The strongest woman.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.274
She's a hero that reigns
in the land of the free

00:06:55.357 --> 00:06:58.569
and the home of the heroes!

00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:01.113
She won't bother with any petty tricks.

00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:04.116
I'm taking a gamble!

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.369
It'll be quite the hassle
if she gets in our way.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.123
But if I can take her Quirk,

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:13.625
then victory is as good as ours.

00:07:14.543 --> 00:07:16.712
Now, Iguchi,

00:07:16.795 --> 00:07:18.672
unlike Toya and the others,

00:07:18.756 --> 00:07:22.009
you've shown devotion as my guard,

00:07:22.092 --> 00:07:24.553
but it's time for you to take action.

00:07:25.054 --> 00:07:26.847
From here on out,

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.142
you will be the one to support
Tomura Shigaraki with his battles.

00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:31.727
Spinner!

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.522
You can spin and weave the future,
just as your name suggests.

00:07:35.606 --> 00:07:37.733
You were nobody.

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:41.487
You led a difficlt life as a heteromorph.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.322
You can hear it already, right?

00:07:43.405 --> 00:07:48.035
There are many people
who silently sympathize with you.

00:07:48.118 --> 00:07:49.453
LIBERATE THE PARANORMALS

00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:55.626
{\an8}SPINNER IS OUR ADVOCATE

00:07:56.251 --> 00:07:58.587
Re-Destro was taken

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.174
by the despicable old regime.

00:08:02.257 --> 00:08:04.176
But look.

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.304
Our dream has not collapsed.

00:08:07.388 --> 00:08:10.933
The spark of liberation
is still smoldering.

00:08:11.517 --> 00:08:14.686
We are the Vanguard Action Support Squad.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.146
Because of what we stand for,

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.733
we were assigned to Spinner's squad.

00:08:19.817 --> 00:08:24.238
Skeptic, who is still unharmed, said this.

00:08:25.489 --> 00:08:26.865
Press on with the liberation!

00:08:27.616 --> 00:08:30.536
Eliminate the remaining resistance
from the old regime

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:34.206
and work to fulfill
Re-Destro's revolution.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.958
Gather the warriors.

00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:40.587
And go about it
in the most convenient way for you all.

00:08:42.423 --> 00:08:44.341
The League may be an irritating bunch

00:08:44.425 --> 00:08:47.719
but joining them is an opportunity
we can't pass up.

00:08:48.345 --> 00:08:51.515
They're people that Re-Destro
regarded as a ray of light.

00:08:52.057 --> 00:08:55.227
Whether the League of Villains will become

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.813
true liberators or not
is of no importance.

00:08:57.896 --> 00:08:59.356
Hold them in high regard!

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.484
We will be the ones to take them
to higher ground.

00:09:02.568 --> 00:09:05.487
Once Tomura Shigaraki brings
everything to destruction,

00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:08.240
we will sow the seeds of our future.

00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:16.081
She'll be entering the airspace soon.

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:19.668
Once we meet up with her,

00:09:19.751 --> 00:09:21.503
let's start planning.

00:09:21.587 --> 00:09:25.466
It's so reassuring to have Star with us,

00:09:25.549 --> 00:09:27.634
but I wonder if she'll get
into trouble back home.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.929
The type of attitude she possesses
will be of great help to us.

00:09:31.013 --> 00:09:32.598
For some time now,

00:09:32.681 --> 00:09:36.435
I've been wanting to talk to her
about the prized vintage denim

00:09:36.518 --> 00:09:38.228
from the Gold Rush.

00:09:38.729 --> 00:09:39.646
This is Tsukauchi.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.940
Endeavor, Hawks, do you copy?

00:09:42.024 --> 00:09:43.567
We got a message.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.195
We're about 50 kilometers
from the landing site...

00:09:46.278 --> 00:09:48.530
It's him! He has shown himself!

00:10:03.462 --> 00:10:05.464
This is quite the welcome.

00:10:06.131 --> 00:10:07.424
You do as you please, huh?

00:10:10.302 --> 00:10:12.971
Are you the villain called All For One?

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:16.350
I wonder...

00:10:17.893 --> 00:10:21.271
What am I?

00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:35.911
He's All For One.

00:10:35.994 --> 00:10:37.663
No, he's not, Star.

00:10:37.746 --> 00:10:39.915
He's Tomura Shigaraki.

00:10:40.666 --> 00:10:44.002
According to intel, he destroys
everything with the touch of a finger.

00:10:44.503 --> 00:10:46.588
He has superpower
and regenerating ability.

00:10:46.672 --> 00:10:48.715
He also uses EMP blasts.

00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:51.468
Deactivate auto-pilot.

00:10:52.094 --> 00:10:53.804
Deploy the Anti-Pulse Field.

00:10:54.429 --> 00:10:56.223
Roger. Bravo Leader.

00:10:56.306 --> 00:10:58.267
Deploy the Anti-Pulse Field.

00:11:03.272 --> 00:11:06.483
Let me ask just in case.
Do you want to attack or avert?

00:11:06.567 --> 00:11:08.026
Of course, we'll...

00:11:08.652 --> 00:11:09.736
smash!

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.571
Okay, Star.

00:11:11.655 --> 00:11:14.241
I hope at least one aircraft
will land safely.

00:11:14.324 --> 00:11:15.659
Deploy the battle formation.

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:19.371
All aircraft! Formation Delta.

00:11:19.454 --> 00:11:21.623
Roger. Bravo Leader.

00:11:22.207 --> 00:11:24.751
Now it's time to take down the villain!

00:11:24.835 --> 00:11:28.922
I'll make sure your remains are returned
to your family.

00:11:29.006 --> 00:11:31.008
Fight without any hesitation!

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:37.264
This feels weird.

00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:41.768
I can say with certainty
that I'm Tomura Shigaraki.

00:11:42.728 --> 00:11:43.854
But at the same time,

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:47.024
I don't have any doubt
that this is me as well.

00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:50.527
This is how it's been
ever since I woke up.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.362
Radio Waves

00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:54.740
plus Air Cannon plus Heavy Payload.

00:11:55.741 --> 00:11:56.908
Prepare to dodge!

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.874
I know what your Quirk is.

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:07.836
Which one of us will be the first
to touch the other, huh, America?

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:09.796
Even if you know all my cards,

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.009
none of your strategies will work,
and that's why I'm the best, young boy.

00:12:14.926 --> 00:12:15.761
Air.

00:12:15.844 --> 00:12:19.264
"From this moment,
air does not exist anywhere

00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:22.392
in the 100-meter area ahead of me."

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.484
Let that kill you!

00:12:30.567 --> 00:12:31.401
{\an8}STAR AND STRIPE
QUIRK: NEW ORDER

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:34.696
{\an8}Star and Stripe. Her Quirk is New Order.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.990
{\an8}It allows her to impose
a rule onto a target

00:12:37.074 --> 00:12:39.576
{\an8}by touching it and calling out its name.

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:42.537
In this case, she touched the air

00:12:42.621 --> 00:12:46.249
and imposed a rule that it cannot
exist within a designated space,

00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:48.543
which removed air from that area.

00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:51.963
This Quirk is cruel!

00:12:52.923 --> 00:12:54.091
I want it!

00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:57.052
I guess someone who came
all the way here to welcome me

00:12:57.135 --> 00:12:59.388
won't be defeated so easily.

00:12:59.888 --> 00:13:02.057
-Laser Cannon!
-Roger!

00:13:07.604 --> 00:13:09.606
Clear shot of the target. Fire!

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.738
-I did it! I struck him!
-No way, Wedge!

00:13:16.822 --> 00:13:19.074
-I struck him first!
-It's not over yet!

00:13:19.157 --> 00:13:21.910
Reflect and Scatter.

00:13:22.994 --> 00:13:24.162
Laser!

00:13:27.082 --> 00:13:28.500
"This Laser

00:13:29.126 --> 00:13:29.960
can be held."

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:34.423
He's regenerating.

00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:37.134
That's why Japanese heroes lost to him.

00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:39.344
The air is no longer restricted.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.638
Does New Order have a limitation?

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:43.598
Now's my chance.

00:13:45.434 --> 00:13:48.854
Sure, let's use superpowers to maneuver
through the air,

00:13:48.937 --> 00:13:50.397
Tomura Shigaraki!

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.026
At any given time, I can only set rules
for two different targets.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.821
One is continually used on myself.

00:13:57.904 --> 00:14:00.782
I can't muster up
super strength like All Might,

00:14:00.866 --> 00:14:02.284
but it's enough.

00:14:03.785 --> 00:14:07.038
A long time ago, I was saved
by a Japanese student studying abroad.

00:14:09.332 --> 00:14:12.252
My family and I were on our way
to the Santa Monica Pier.

00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:14.671
A robber on the run

00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:17.257
came and attacked our car.

00:14:17.841 --> 00:14:19.593
I hoped to at least protect my sister.

00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:22.262
Just when I thought I'd die...

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:30.270
he came.

00:14:32.647 --> 00:14:34.524
I will never forget

00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:38.111
those two tufts of hair.

00:14:39.529 --> 00:14:41.740
He's my beloved mentor.

00:14:42.407 --> 00:14:45.035
To display my commitment of contributing
to even greater peace,

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:47.954
I have eight tufts of hair!

00:14:48.705 --> 00:14:50.582
No matter where I go,

00:14:51.082 --> 00:14:52.959
I keep hearing about All Might!

00:14:53.043 --> 00:14:56.338
That's why he's the Symbol of Peace.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.714
By the way,

00:14:57.798 --> 00:15:00.926
I touched you a moment ago
and said your name.

00:15:02.427 --> 00:15:06.014
"If Tomura Shigaraki moves even an inch,

00:15:07.474 --> 00:15:08.892
his heart will stop."

00:15:09.976 --> 00:15:10.894
She fell for it.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.899
I had an inkling
ever since the moment I woke up.

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:20.612
The boundary was obscure.

00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:24.825
Normally, it would've taken
two months of rest

00:15:24.908 --> 00:15:27.828
for you to completely fuse with me
to become one.

00:15:27.911 --> 00:15:29.913
But you're incredible, Tomura.

00:15:29.996 --> 00:15:33.416
Your hatred and your destructive impulses

00:15:34.042 --> 00:15:38.338
exceeded both the doctor's
and my expectations!

00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:41.258
If I'm to explain it in a percentage,
it might be 97%

00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:43.927
or maybe even 98%.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.347
Soon, we will become one.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.518
We will be neither All For One
nor Tomura Shigaraki.

00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:56.314
We will meld together
and become a whole new person.

00:15:57.148 --> 00:15:59.025
I don't want that.

00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:00.777
I don't want that!

00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:03.405
It's not working on him.
That wasn't his name?

00:16:04.114 --> 00:16:06.408
Is he not Tomura Shigaraki?

00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:08.493
I see.

00:16:08.577 --> 00:16:10.287
I don't mind.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.664
Do you hate me? Hate me even more!

00:16:13.248 --> 00:16:17.002
Your hatred will lead us
to our bright future!

00:16:17.085 --> 00:16:17.919
His hair!

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:21.923
It all began at that house.

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:25.051
The little pieces of hate

00:16:25.135 --> 00:16:27.679
that were piled on little by little.

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:33.685
His hair grew!

00:16:34.352 --> 00:16:36.021
I can't understand him.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.983
I'm starting to understand New Order.

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:43.236
It's very strong,
but there are rules to it.

00:16:44.362 --> 00:16:48.241
America's number one hero,
Star and Stripe.

00:16:48.783 --> 00:16:50.410
Her Quirk

00:16:50.493 --> 00:16:53.538
is observed by the government,
and details about it are confidential.

00:16:54.039 --> 00:16:56.291
By touching a target and saying its name,

00:16:56.374 --> 00:16:58.168
she can impose any rule she chooses.

00:16:59.127 --> 00:17:02.964
It's an exorbitant power that goes beyond
the definition of a general Quirk.

00:17:03.465 --> 00:17:06.718
But I learned a few things
through our battle just now.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.306
There's a limit to powering up
a living thing or a physical body.

00:17:11.973 --> 00:17:13.934
If there was no limit,

00:17:14.017 --> 00:17:17.145
she wouldn't have hesitated
to crush my head with one blow.

00:17:17.854 --> 00:17:21.775
"If Tomura Shigaraki moves even an inch,

00:17:21.858 --> 00:17:23.610
his heart will stop."

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.321
Those words revealed

00:17:26.404 --> 00:17:28.865
that there's no limit to how much
it can weaken a body.

00:17:29.658 --> 00:17:30.742
For example,

00:17:30.825 --> 00:17:32.494
it's like a barometer

00:17:32.577 --> 00:17:35.372
where she can freely choose
the maximum limit.

00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:36.373
On the other hand,

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:39.584
she didn't say, "You will die

00:17:39.668 --> 00:17:41.753
if you touch the air within this range."

00:17:41.836 --> 00:17:43.296
Her words alone

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.758
can't impose rules on things
that she has not touched.

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:51.137
Or perhaps they can,
but it won't be as effective.

00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:52.681
However,

00:17:52.764 --> 00:17:56.476
the rules allow her to vacuum the air
and manipulate lasers.

00:17:57.477 --> 00:18:01.523
She has a lot of freedom
to control nonliving things.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.151
That's the true essence of New Order.

00:18:05.735 --> 00:18:08.363
The different levels of power
between the living and nonliving

00:18:08.446 --> 00:18:10.740
lie in the action of naming the target.

00:18:11.241 --> 00:18:14.035
The rule she imposed on me
wasn't effective

00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:15.412
because I'm not who she thinks I am.

00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:17.831
Ms. Star touched me

00:18:17.914 --> 00:18:20.959
thinking I was Tomura Shigaraki,

00:18:21.042 --> 00:18:25.130
but right now, I'm not aware
of who I really am. Am I Shigaraki,

00:18:25.213 --> 00:18:28.758
All For One,
or perhaps even Tenko Shimura?

00:18:29.426 --> 00:18:32.679
When calling the name
of a living thing with a sense of self,

00:18:32.762 --> 00:18:35.849
both party's understanding
of the name must be in agreement.

00:18:35.932 --> 00:18:37.559
With inanimate objects,

00:18:37.642 --> 00:18:41.146
Ms. Star can impose any rule on them
with her one-sided understanding.

00:18:41.688 --> 00:18:43.773
Can she only control two targets at once?

00:18:43.857 --> 00:18:45.275
What about the range?

00:18:45.859 --> 00:18:47.318
What about my dog Mon?

00:18:47.402 --> 00:18:50.405
Will the rules work if she calls
him by his name Mon?

00:18:50.488 --> 00:18:53.950
What's gotten into me?

00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:57.412
I'm bothered by how much
I want to test out the rules of her Quirk.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.958
He must have a strategy to deal
with the lack of air.

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:03.501
What's your plan, Star?

00:19:03.585 --> 00:19:06.046
New Order or the laser barrages
won't work on him.

00:19:06.129 --> 00:19:07.672
That regenerating scum.

00:19:08.465 --> 00:19:10.300
Send a message to Commander Agpar.

00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:11.676
What?

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.804
You're already in trouble
for coming here without permission.

00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:16.347
If we don't use it here,

00:19:16.431 --> 00:19:18.683
what's the point of having
special command authority?

00:19:18.767 --> 00:19:21.936
He's no longer just a threat to Japan.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.646
He'll become a threat to the world.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.483
We will use tactics
that are not used in Japan

00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:28.568
to kill him right here right now!

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:31.529
Therefore, make sure I have

00:19:31.613 --> 00:19:34.491
a place to stand until we get assistance.

00:19:35.742 --> 00:19:36.868
Oh, man.

00:19:36.951 --> 00:19:39.829
You're such a troublesome number one hero.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.999
Starting today, you'll be working with me.

00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:45.460
Let's risk our lives together, Brothers!

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.713
Wedge, shake off that rag!

00:19:48.797 --> 00:19:50.548
That's where Star belongs!

00:19:50.632 --> 00:19:51.758
Got it!

00:19:54.302 --> 00:19:57.597
Even if you know my powers, you can't plan
a counterstrategy. Let me prove it to you!

00:19:58.306 --> 00:19:59.682
"The air

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:02.852
will be shaped into a form
1,000 times my size."

00:20:03.812 --> 00:20:06.981
Fist Bump to the Earth!

00:20:09.567 --> 00:20:12.737
It's not visible, but I sense
an imposing figure.

00:20:18.326 --> 00:20:20.370
It's pointless to accumulate more damage.

00:20:20.453 --> 00:20:22.288
I want to ask him for his real name,

00:20:22.372 --> 00:20:24.582
but I'm sure he won't tell me.

00:20:24.666 --> 00:20:27.252
The only strategy left to destroy him is...

00:20:30.046 --> 00:20:32.549
To crush him to smithereens!

00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:34.259
But it's hard!

00:20:34.342 --> 00:20:36.678
Bros! Give me the laser!

00:20:37.595 --> 00:20:38.847
"The lasers

00:20:42.892 --> 00:20:45.061
will combine into one!"

00:20:45.854 --> 00:20:48.439
United Hyper-Max Output Laser:

00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:51.151
Keraunos!

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.113
The Hyper-Max Output Laser
is on full blast nonstop!

00:20:55.196 --> 00:20:57.198
I'm sure he'll burn to death!

00:20:57.282 --> 00:20:59.784
Not yet. I'm barely stopping him
from regenerating.

00:21:00.618 --> 00:21:01.786
This won't kill him.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.539
Otherwise, Endeavor would've
been able to kill him long ago.

00:21:04.622 --> 00:21:06.666
-Star.
-Mr. Agpar!

00:21:07.292 --> 00:21:10.670
I got accustomed to your free spirit,
so I let my guard down.

00:21:10.753 --> 00:21:13.923
But this time, your action will revoke you
of more than your hero license.

00:21:14.007 --> 00:21:16.759
That's fine. By the way,
is the preparation done?

00:21:16.843 --> 00:21:19.179
I added one extra as a special favor.

00:21:19.262 --> 00:21:22.849
I contacted Japan.
It should be there soon.

00:21:22.932 --> 00:21:24.684
That's lovely.

00:21:25.268 --> 00:21:28.313
You're not bound by rules,
and you do as you please,

00:21:28.396 --> 00:21:30.940
but that's what made
our country shine bright.

00:21:31.024 --> 00:21:32.859
Even All Might

00:21:32.942 --> 00:21:35.195
couldn't destroy this villain.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.448
It's time to surpass him, Cassie.

00:21:39.073 --> 00:21:42.952
State-of-the-Art Hypersonic
Intercontinental Cruise Missiles.

00:21:43.036 --> 00:21:44.704
They're called Tiamat.

00:21:44.787 --> 00:21:47.957
Make sure they hit the mark!

00:23:20.633 --> 00:23:23.094
Preview of the next episode.

00:23:23.177 --> 00:23:26.681
The battle between Star and Stripe
and Tomura Shigaraki.

00:23:26.764 --> 00:23:28.975
The combination
of Star's Quirk, New Order,

00:23:29.058 --> 00:23:31.019
and the Intercontinental Cruise Missiles,

00:23:31.102 --> 00:23:32.812
Tiamat, makes an attack.

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:34.981
Will they be able to stop the evil?

00:23:36.065 --> 00:23:39.318
This is the decisive moment
that will affect the whole world.

00:23:39.402 --> 00:23:41.404
Next episode, "Specter."

00:23:41.988 --> 00:23:45.158
That's the stron
will which belongs to people

00:23:45.241 --> 00:23:46.826
who have inherited the light.

00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:49.287
Go Beyond! Plus Ultra!

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.621
