00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:18.560
Jin-hee.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.814
You grow crops by yourself
and run the store for your sister.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:24.607
Isn't it tiring?

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:27.652
It's okay. I don't do it all the time.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.405
I'm about to head home too.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.033
Right, by the way,

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:37.495
Mr. Kim said your sister has gotten better
and has been out and about.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.581
Oh, yes.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.043
She says she's suddenly fine again.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.838
Still, she might suddenly get worse.
You should take her to a doctor.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.175
She keeps insisting that she won't go,

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.677
but I'm taking her tomorrow,
no matter what.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.638
It'd be great
if she really is all better now.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.558
Kyung-hee was like a mother
to you and your brother.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.103
Kang-woo, that punk.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.897
He should come and help you.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.608
That useless bastard. My goodness.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.780
He said he'd earn money in Seoul
to chip in for Kyung-hee's hospital bills.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.741
Don't hold your breath.
As if that fool will do that.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.119
It must be hard for you on your own.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:20.705
I'll get going now.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.374
Okay. Goodbye, sir.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.292
Bye.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:38.932
Hello, Ki-seok.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.266
It's Jin-hee.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.102
Hi, Jin-hee. How are you?

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.228
So, what's up?

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:45.939
Well, the thing is,

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:49.526
have you spoken to Kang-woo recently?

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.443
No.

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.780
It's been a while since we lost touch.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:58.118
-You don't know his number?
-He hasn't called in a while.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:01.246
Try sending him a DM.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.081
A DM?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.792
You know, that messenger.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.837
Right. Does Kang-woo still use that?

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.883
I'm not sure if he still checks it,
but he might see it later and call you.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:15.343
Right.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.139
Okay. Then I'll try that.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:20.807
Okay, call me again anytime.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.684
Okay, bye.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.153
Merry!

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.282
What is it? What's wrong?

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.375
Who are you?

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:50.753
This is the pastor from my church.

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:54.674
The pastor who wouldn't let you
see a doctor?

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.969
Merry, be quiet.
What's gotten into you lately?

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:01.264
Sister Jin-hee,

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.684
your sister has told me so much about you.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.687
He visited our home to pray for me.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:09.856
Don't you think

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:13.026
a church should send a sick person
to the hospital?

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.319
What good do prayers do?

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:16.863
Anyway, don't forget,

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.823
we're going to the hospital tomorrow.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.367
You're getting an MRI, no matter what.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.286
I do not need to go to the hospital.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.038
Sister Jin-hee,

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:28.625
you shouldn't worry
about your sister anymore.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.213
-By the power of God--
-Excuse me.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.257
Whether she's really better or not,

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.343
we need to check.

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:44.766
-She doesn't need to go.
-This doesn't concern you, Pastor.

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.740
We should get rid of her right now.

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:04.118
It might cause trouble if we do it here.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.287
No one lives around this place.

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:08.706
Kyung-hee,

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.416
what are you saying?

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.380
Do you really want to know
what is inside my head?

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:27.016
Merry, run!

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.559
Merry! No!

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.025
Help! Someone help me!

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.208
{\an8}SEOL KANG-WOO
FRIEND ON MESSENGER

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:46.846
KANG-WOO'S FRIEND KI-SEOK

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.350
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave aâ€¦

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.061
Why the hell isn't he answering his phone?

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:59.275
IT'S ME KANG-WOO
PICK UP YOUR PHONE, DICKHEAD

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:08.534
-Hello?
-Why are you using Jin-hee's phone?

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.119
It's a long story.

00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:12.038
Are you still in Cheonan?

00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:15.041
No, I moved to Jinyang because of work.

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:17.377
Jinyang? Why did you move so far away?

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.630
Anyway, can I crash at your place
for a few days?

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:21.756
When are you coming?

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.550
Right now. I should be there
in two hours if I leave now.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.052
CHOI YONG-JAE, CIVILIAN ARMY LEADER

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:28.763
I'm not home.
I'm out taking care of something.

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:31.015
If you don't want me to come, just say so.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:35.061
I'll text you my address
and the passcode. Let yourself in.

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:36.229
Okay. Thanks, man.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:43.361
Damn.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.077
Hey.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.454
Are you done changing?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.916
We have to go.

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:00.545
Get yourself together, and let's go.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:04.632
I said let's go.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.959
UNIT 402, CHANGJIN STUDIO APT.
CODE 0823

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:32.386
PARASYTE: THE GREY

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:38.768
Videos posted by eyewitnesses
have already been going viral.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:42.480
It's a shame this happened
just before the Folk Music Festival.

00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:44.232
It's causing us a lot of trouble.

00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:46.817
I understand Namil-gun's situation.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.362
But unlike other areas,

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:53.157
the parasites here
work as an organization,

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.993
so a large-scale clean-up operation
is inevitable.

00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:00.248
If you give us more time,
we can recapture Jeong Su-in.

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:05.336
What's Namil Police's position on this?

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:07.672
We are doing our best as well,

00:09:07.755 --> 00:09:10.633
but we can't do that much
since our job is to support Team Grey.

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.593
Well, for us, we're in a position

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:15.513
where we simply follow
Captain Choi's orders.

00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:18.057
So we can't operate as we see fit.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.892
There's a limit to what we can do.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.227
Listen, Captain Choi,

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:25.398
The transfer operation failed
because you worked in a vacuum

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:27.858
without sharing any information like this.

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.820
It's time to inform the public

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:33.322
about the parasites, receive reports,

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:37.285
and work closely with the local police
to eradicate the parasites.

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:38.536
Do I make myself clear?

00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:39.537
Yes, sir.

00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:42.623
{\an8}And what about
the Korean Folk Music Festival?

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:46.127
{\an8}It's not possible until we destroy
the parasite organization.

00:09:46.627 --> 00:09:50.047
{\an8}Team Grey and the Namil Police
will do their best

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.342
to eradicate it completely
before the event takes place.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:56.345
Do you think
this festival is some kind of joke?

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.472
{\an8}This festival is to celebrate

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.892
{\an8}the opening
of the Choi Yong-jae Memorial Hall!

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:06.147
You do know that he led the Battle
of Cheonryongsan during the Korean War?

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.734
It's a tourist attraction
that our district spent years developing.

00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:12.945
Numerous merchants here
make their living through this festival.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.114
And you're telling us
to cancel the festival

00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:17.366
because of those so-called monsters?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.660
{\an8}What you're all saying is ridiculous.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.121
{\an8}Especially this year,

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:24.582
{\an8}with a visit scheduled
from the mayor of Namcheon.

00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:26.167
I'm reporting this to him!

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.294
Sir, please calm down.

00:10:28.377 --> 00:10:31.547
{\an8}For now, we'll do our best.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.924
{\an8}This is our mayor's last year in office.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:37.553
{\an8}As you know, he's a key candidate
for the next presidential election.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:42.433
{\an8}This year's festival
is the last big occasion for him as mayor.

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:45.227
{\an8}This is not something
we can just cancel on a whim!

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.022
Captain Choi,

00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:49.774
I'll give you three days.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.317
Can you get it done?

00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:55.404
-Yes, sir.
-We don't have much time, so get to work.

00:11:03.537 --> 00:11:07.291
It'll be a tough three days, but they say
a crisis can turn into an opportunity.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.043
Is it not a good thing, then?

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:11.295
You said humans like drama.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.631
Hold on. Come this way.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.346
You see,

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.641
when Jeong Su-in was captured,

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.227
her X-rays came back as normal.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.478
How is this possible?

00:11:30.314 --> 00:11:31.315
She is a mutant.

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.484
What does that mean?

00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:36.112
I need to find out
what kind of mutant she is.

00:11:43.577 --> 00:11:47.915
The man who is accompanying
the girl of our kin has been located.

00:11:47.998 --> 00:11:50.626
That girl is a mutant mixed with a human.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.044
Do you need support?

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:53.421
No.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.214
She is very powerful.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.008
I can handle her by myself.

00:11:58.092 --> 00:12:00.970
Okay. Come to the meeting place
when you are done.

00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:09.437
Regardless of what she's doing,

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:13.315
we should get started
with our business now, yeah?

00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:19.488
Pastor.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.741
No, I mean Captain. Look.

00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:26.996
At a time like this, you should respond
with a meaningful expression or something.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.750
Why don't you try copying me? Come on.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.627
A meaningful look.

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:36.630
Yeah, like that. Good. Smile wider.

00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:40.342
Together with your eyes. Your eyes--

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:41.385
Damn it.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.570
Right, it's over there.

00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:20.090
Is this your friend's place?

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:23.719
He's more like a brother than a friend.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.556
I'm like the reliable older brother.
He's like the wimpy little brother.

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:29.266
Here. Unit 402.

00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:41.737
Ki-seok was a weak little bastard,
so he always got beaten up by other kids.

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:43.948
And I often saved him.

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:47.535
-That was nice of you.
-What is this?

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.495
Is that really Ki-seok?

00:13:57.586 --> 00:13:59.004
But why did we come here?

00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:03.217
Hey, I'm exhausted too. Okay?

00:14:04.718 --> 00:14:07.388
I want to rest and charge my phone.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.936
And most importantly,
we need money since we're on the run.

00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:20.442
Hey, Ki-seok.

00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:22.361
Yeah, I'm at your place.

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:23.863
Yeah.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.031
On your way back,

00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:30.077
withdraw like 1.5 million,
no, bring 2 million won.

00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:33.122
It's a long story.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.376
I want to join a gym, okay?

00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:39.712
Bring the money I asked for.

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:45.217
Hey, you should rest too.

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:52.516
When we get the money from Ki-seok,

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:56.395
let's run away
to somewhere remote and lie low.

00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:00.900
I'm not running away.

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.236
Why not?

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:07.656
You plan on fighting them?

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.325
I have to tell them.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.452
Tell them what?

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.331
A lot of the cops are probably monsters.

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:16.916
Who will you tell?

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:18.709
That woman.

00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.921
We have to make her trust us.

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:23.047
You've lost it.

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:28.844
This doesn't concern you,
so you can run away or whatever.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.141
You're driving me crazy.

00:15:36.143 --> 00:15:39.063
Time is running out, everyone.
You need toâ€¦

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:42.024
{\an8}A clash broke out on a highway
in Namil-gun yesterday

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:44.735
{\an8}between the police
and unidentified monstrous creatures.

00:15:44.818 --> 00:15:46.987
{\an8}As numerous citizens witnessed the scene,

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:49.406
{\an8}videos of the incident
are spreading rapidly

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:53.118
{\an8}on social media
and various online portals.

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:55.663
{\an8}The police have issued a statement
about the incident,

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:58.499
{\an8}emphasizing
that it will be resolved promptly.

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:02.378
{\an8}Currently, the police know
almost everything there is to know

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.838
{\an8}about the reported monstrous creatures,

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:08.008
{\an8}and are in the process of exterminating
a significant number of them.

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:10.219
{\an8}In order to minimize social chaos,

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:12.680
{\an8}we'd been carrying out the operation
in secret.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.556
{\an8}We apologize for that.

00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:18.769
{\an8}We are now switching our response strategy

00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:20.479
{\an8}to an open investigation.

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:23.357
{\an8}We promise to eradicate them
completely and permanently

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.401
{\an8}through a large-scale clean-up operation

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:28.195
{\an8}with the cooperation and information
provided by the public.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:29.655
Look at that.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:33.200
How do we even know
whether that cop is a monster or not?

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.037
So, what are you planning to tell them?

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.841
-We will look into it.
-Confirming right now.

00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:50.759
I'd like to confirm the location again.

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:52.261
May I please have your name?

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:54.430
Yes, understood.

00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:02.312
Excuse me, Captain Choi.

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:03.480
May I help you?

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.150
We've received a report.

00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:08.652
Something was sighted
near the outskirts of Namil-gun.

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.530
I think it might be their hideout.

00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:14.033
Reports are pouring in right now.

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.910
Was there any critical information
worth our attention?

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.622
Has this information been made public too?

00:17:24.793 --> 00:17:27.296
This information came in
before the police announcement.

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:29.298
We sent in a team to investigate it.

00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:31.550
Our team confirmed

00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:35.637
that people are gathering in the warehouse
with that symbol on its door.

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:39.767
It's been reported that
about 20 people have gathered so far.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.560
After withdrawing from Saejin Church,

00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:44.396
it seems they've been using this place
as their base.

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:50.069
I'm sure they know we're concentrating
our efforts on Namil-gun.

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:53.238
So why wouldn't they leave this area?

00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:56.450
They must have decided
it would be better not to move rashly.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:57.785
Yes, I agree.

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:01.413
Checkpoints and searches
have been reinforced on major roads,

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:02.498
so that could be it.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.042
Hiding right under our noses on purpose.

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.504
I doubt they're that savvy.

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:15.135
Captain Choi,
they're more capable than you think.

00:18:15.719 --> 00:18:18.097
They're quick learners
who analyzed humanity

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.350
and then used a religious organization
to stay off the radar.

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.685
I think you're underestimating them.

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.313
The governor of Namil-gun and the citizens

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:29.191
are calling for a swift resolution
to the situation.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.860
Please make your decision quickly.

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:38.784
Let's launch the clean-up operation
at sunrise tomorrow.

00:19:19.783 --> 00:19:21.326
It's none of my business.

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:56.403
Hello?

00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:00.782
Jeong Su-in?

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:04.411
You're the woman
who's trying to catch me, right?

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.580
So it is you, Su-in.

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.374
Where are you right now?

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:10.667
First, listen to me.

00:20:12.502 --> 00:20:15.839
There are parasites
among the police where you are.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.133
Okay, sure.

00:20:18.675 --> 00:20:19.760
Mr. Chul-min

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:23.263
and his detective partner
are both parasites.

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:26.725
I see. But you know what?

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:31.188
We have this thing called
a physical security exam.

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:35.400
You need to pass that exam
to get an access card.

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:38.403
Whatever that is,
you can just examine them again.

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:41.990
If what you're saying is true,

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:44.451
why don't you help me?

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.079
That will make things much easier.

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:52.668
In any case,
you want to get rid of them too, right?

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.465
Why don't we meet up in person and talk?

00:21:01.718 --> 00:21:03.387
Gukil CafÃ© in Shingwan-dong,

00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:04.930
Jinyang-si.

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:20.821
You're listening, right?

00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:23.991
Let me make myself clear.

00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:27.202
I'm not running away, no matter what.

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:47.472
What the heck, man?

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:51.310
Look at the time. Why are you so late?

00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:53.937
Hey.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.897
What's going on?

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:59.359
What mess did you
get yourself into this time?

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:02.362
I saved the world for a brief moment.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.033
Anyway, thanks for this.
I'll pay you back. Thank you.

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:07.534
Forget it, man.

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:10.537
By the way, you met with Jin-hee, right?

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:12.873
Jin-hee?

00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:16.668
She called me out of the blue recently
and asked for your number.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.420
When was that?

00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:20.088
About two weeks ago?

00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:23.633
I'm not sure, but anyway,
I hadn't heard from you either,

00:22:23.717 --> 00:22:25.385
so I told her to send you a DM.

00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:29.222
And I said you might check it later
if she sent you a message.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:34.061
MESSAGE SAVED, 15 DAYS AGO

00:22:34.144 --> 00:22:35.729
{\an8}SEND A MESSAGE TO SEOL KANG-WOO

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:39.733
DON'T COME HOME, NO MATTERâ€¦

00:22:41.276 --> 00:22:44.738
DON'T COME HOME, NO MATTER

00:22:46.656 --> 00:22:49.743
Do you know why you got betrayed
by your gang and are on the run now?

00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:52.329
Because you're a goddamn coward.

00:22:52.412 --> 00:22:53.246
Right?

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:56.291
You said the monsters killed
your little sister,

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:58.377
and your older sister became one.

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.921
Now Su-in, who saved your life,
is about to die.

00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:03.090
And you're running away?

00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:06.343
Sure, that's who you are,
a goddamn coward.

00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:15.352
Fuck. I'm totally gonna get screwed.

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:17.771
What do you mean?

00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:22.192
Hey, I need to go downtown.
Let me borrow your car.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.204
Welcome.

00:23:40.168 --> 00:23:42.129
Did you happen to see a young woman here?

00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:43.547
She looks like this.

00:23:44.631 --> 00:23:46.758
Oh, she said
she'd be waiting on the rooftop.

00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:51.388
Excuse me. She said you have her wallet.

00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:55.016
And that you'd pay
for her coffee, 5,000 won.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.698
Jeong Su-in!

00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:11.575
Where are you?

00:24:13.493 --> 00:24:14.327
Su-in!

00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:17.289
Where are you?

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:20.375
Su-in!

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:22.961
Jeong Su-in!

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.134
What?

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.179
You thought I'd bring the police again?

00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:33.722
I had to be prepared.

00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:36.933
Smart move.

00:24:37.517 --> 00:24:40.854
If you try to pull anything stupid,
then Heidi will take over.

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:42.647
Heidi?

00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:48.320
So, what you're trying to say is

00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:50.780
that you're still a human right now.

00:24:50.864 --> 00:24:53.408
And the parasiteâ€¦
No. What did you call it? Heidi?

00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:55.494
So, you and that coexist. Is that it?

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:57.496
Simply put, yes.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.499
Okay, sure.

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:04.461
What were you trying to say earlier?

00:25:04.544 --> 00:25:05.795
It's exactly as you heard.

00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:09.132
Mr. Chul-min and his detective partner
are both parasites.

00:25:11.134 --> 00:25:13.845
Let's say you can make that claim
against Detective Kang.

00:25:14.804 --> 00:25:18.683
But Detective Kim has tried
to protect you until the very end.

00:25:19.392 --> 00:25:21.353
So, why are you saying this now?

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:24.689
Mr. Chul-minâ€¦

00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:29.152
died.

00:25:30.445 --> 00:25:31.863
Right in front of my eyes.

00:25:32.822 --> 00:25:33.657
What?

00:25:34.908 --> 00:25:36.326
He was trying to protect me.

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:41.289
But the pastor Kang Won-seok brought along
cut off his head.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.710
And that bastard took over his body
and is pretending to be him!

00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:47.379
Why won't you believe me?

00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:55.512
Actually, someone reported today
that they found the parasites' hideout.

00:25:56.596 --> 00:25:58.139
The two people you mentioned.

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:02.686
Detectives Kim and Kang insisted
on a large-scale clean-up operation.

00:26:03.603 --> 00:26:05.397
If what you're saying is true,

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:10.694
then that means they're impostors
trying to sabotage our operations.

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:13.488
Why would they suggest such a thing?

00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:16.199
It's obvious! It's a trap!

00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:19.494
If you guys go there,
you'll all be killed by them.

00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:22.706
There's one way to find out.

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.584
You come with us.

00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:27.335
"Us"?

00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:33.216
If you're truly on our side,

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.928
you can come with us
and find out if it's a trap or not, right?

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.809
We don't want
any physical conflict either.

00:26:42.892 --> 00:26:44.769
So, will you cooperate with us?

00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:47.689
Can you convince Heidi?

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.441
If you can communicate with that.

00:26:49.524 --> 00:26:50.358
Okay?

00:26:55.322 --> 00:26:56.448
Get her!

00:26:59.075 --> 00:27:01.119
Damn it! Jeong Su-in!

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:06.207
What was that?

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.268
Hey, it's me! Get in!

00:27:38.406 --> 00:27:39.658
Split up and find her.

00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:40.742
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes.

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:44.621
Damn it. Where did she run off to?

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:55.173
Your friend

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.968
is doing something
incredibly dangerous right now.

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:03.098
Tell her that it does not help
in our survival at all.

00:28:04.432 --> 00:28:07.977
Su-in is doing her damn best
to survive right now.

00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:12.273
I do not understand what you are saying.

00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:18.613
Sure, to you guys, survival means
just being alive and breathing, right?

00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:20.824
But it's different for humans.

00:28:20.907 --> 00:28:21.741
For humans,

00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:24.744
survival means living among people.

00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:27.539
But Su-in can't do anything right now.

00:28:28.331 --> 00:28:29.165
So,

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.584
in order to survive,

00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:35.547
she's trying
to get more people to trust her.

00:28:37.507 --> 00:28:40.135
That's the survival method she's chosen.

00:28:46.474 --> 00:28:49.060
Even if that is the survival method
she has chosen,

00:28:50.353 --> 00:28:52.105
do not let her engage

00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:54.357
in anything dangerous
for the next three hours.

00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:56.985
Why?

00:28:57.068 --> 00:29:00.155
Since yesterday, I've taken over
her consciousness for too long.

00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.533
For at least the next three hours,

00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:06.077
I have no choice
but to be completely asleep.

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:10.540
No matter what happens,
I will not be able to help.

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:14.002
-Okay.
-I'm seriously warning you.

00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:17.046
Do not engage in anything dangerous.

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:19.132
Thenâ€¦

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.053
She always gets the last word.

00:29:25.889 --> 00:29:27.390
After the police announcement

00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:29.976
confirming the existence
of monstrous creatures

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:32.979
known as parasites,
which had only been believed to be rumors,

00:29:33.062 --> 00:29:36.608
other related instances and videos
that had been circulating on the internetâ€¦

00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:37.567
What the hell?

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.068
â€¦have been proven to be true.

00:29:39.569 --> 00:29:41.863
Many citizens
have been expressing their anxiety

00:29:41.946 --> 00:29:44.157
on social media and various online portals

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.493
since the announcement was made.

00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:47.452
My goodness.

00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:48.828
In particular, some reportsâ€¦

00:29:48.912 --> 00:29:51.331
Seriously, even crazy stuff
like this is happening.

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:53.833
Kang-woo?

00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:56.669
If you wrecked my car, you're dead meat.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:03.676
Kyung-hee?

00:30:04.385 --> 00:30:06.805
Kang-woo went out.

00:30:13.394 --> 00:30:14.229
What?

00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:16.606
Good morning.

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:21.945
Hey, Heidi said she has no energy left
and has to sleep for the next three hours,

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.739
so don't do anything dangerous
for three hours.

00:30:25.698 --> 00:30:28.159
Righteous defender,
contain your enthusiasm a bit.

00:30:37.418 --> 00:30:39.879
I'm almost there.
Don't worry. I won't crash your car.

00:30:39.963 --> 00:30:42.799
Hey, hurry up. Your sister is here.

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:48.513
-What?
-He said he'll be back soon.

00:30:49.722 --> 00:30:52.350
By the way, why don't you have a seat?

00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:56.271
-Ki-seok, is she next to you?
-Yes.

00:30:56.855 --> 00:30:59.607
Listen. Just give her some excuse
and get out of there.

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:01.609
What are you talking about?

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:06.573
Look, that's not my sister.
Get out of there quickly.

00:31:06.656 --> 00:31:09.659
What are you talking about?
Just get your ass here quickly.

00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:22.213
You are with our kin right now, right?

00:31:23.798 --> 00:31:25.425
I will give you 15 minutes.

00:31:26.926 --> 00:31:28.887
Bring my kin with you.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:34.267
If you do not come in 15 minutes,
your friend will be decapitated.

00:31:38.354 --> 00:31:39.689
It's me they're after,

00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:40.899
so let's go.

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:43.860
Didn't you hear what Heidi said?

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.571
She won't be able to do anything
for three hours.

00:31:47.113 --> 00:31:48.781
They won't know Heidi is asleep.

00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:51.159
They'll just think I'm one of them.

00:31:51.951 --> 00:31:55.121
They seem to sense each other
through some kind of feeling.

00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:57.165
They'll just think I'm one of them too.

00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:01.628
What's your plan?
What if they still kill you?

00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:06.883
Right now, it's important for them
to have more support on their side.

00:32:06.966 --> 00:32:10.845
So I'll pretend to cooperate with them
to buy us three hours.

00:32:13.556 --> 00:32:14.390
Okay?

00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:16.434
Are you just gonna let your friend die?

00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:21.105
Come on, let's go.

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.013
I came as you asked.

00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:55.682
Let the human go.

00:32:57.934 --> 00:32:59.268
I am one of your kin.

00:33:00.103 --> 00:33:01.729
I want to be on your side.

00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:03.940
You are amusing.

00:33:05.441 --> 00:33:07.193
I can barely feel your brain waves.

00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:09.696
Are you asleep inside that human?

00:33:10.613 --> 00:33:11.447
What?

00:33:11.948 --> 00:33:14.575
I already know
the police ran tests on you.

00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:26.087
Our kin inside of that humanâ€¦

00:33:29.757 --> 00:33:32.093
can you still hear me
even though you are asleep?

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:38.057
Although I am curious why you could not
fully take over that human's brain,

00:33:39.892 --> 00:33:41.561
you are a threat to our kinâ€¦

00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:44.772
so I must kill you.

00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:48.234
We do not need a mutant like you.

00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:52.030
I heard you are quite powerful.

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:55.867
If you want to protect your host,

00:33:57.326 --> 00:33:59.620
you need to fight me right now and win.

00:34:04.333 --> 00:34:05.168
Get down!

00:34:07.253 --> 00:34:08.337
Ki-seok, come out now!

00:34:12.842 --> 00:34:14.135
Ki-seok!

00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:17.263
Come on, get out quickly!

00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:20.475
Ki-seok!

00:34:22.602 --> 00:34:24.812
You idiot, what are you doing?

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:26.439
Hey! Let's go!

00:34:26.522 --> 00:34:28.232
You're gonna get killed too!

00:34:28.316 --> 00:34:29.192
Ki-seok!

00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:35.198
Come on, we have to go!

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:37.283
Hurry!

00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:42.080
Hey, get in!

00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:08.314
I'm gonna kill them!
I'll never forgive them!

00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:31.129
We currently have four undercover teams
monitoring the area around their hideout.

00:35:31.212 --> 00:35:32.672
Our team is ready to go.

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:35.383
-Then we'll get ready to move out.
-Okay.

00:35:37.176 --> 00:35:40.972
When our strike team moves in,
will you be joining us?

00:35:42.098 --> 00:35:45.768
We will barricade the surrounding area
and prepare for any contingencies.

00:35:46.894 --> 00:35:47.895
Is there a problem?

00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:51.899
No.

00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:54.026
Let's go.

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:39.197
This will likely be
Team Grey's last operation in our region.

00:36:40.323 --> 00:36:43.534
Perhaps. I guess
we'll have to see today's result.

00:36:54.128 --> 00:36:56.339
Please go ahead first. I forgot something.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.759
Nothing to note.

00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:49.558
Captain Choi.

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:53.980
We've evacuated the area
and started to close off the roads.

00:37:54.563 --> 00:37:57.149
Oh, and we're ready to go too.

00:37:57.733 --> 00:37:59.902
Okay. Please stand by.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.257
-Which one is it this time?
-Listen carefully.

00:38:21.924 --> 00:38:24.010
The clean-up operation you're about to do,

00:38:24.093 --> 00:38:25.177
it's a trap.

00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:27.096
And who is this?

00:38:27.596 --> 00:38:29.890
Is this Seol Kang-woo
of the Mangnani Gang?

00:38:31.517 --> 00:38:32.351
It is you.

00:38:33.769 --> 00:38:35.062
Is Jeong Su-in with you?

00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:37.273
Yes.

00:38:38.107 --> 00:38:41.110
The clean-up operation is a trap,
so stop it.

00:38:41.902 --> 00:38:45.489
Okay, but the thing is,
that's easier said than done.

00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:50.661
The people of Namil-gun are serious
about the Korean Folk Music Festival.

00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:52.747
They all want the parasites
quickly destroyed

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.041
so that they can proceed
with the festival.

00:38:55.124 --> 00:38:56.792
I know it's ridiculous.

00:38:58.461 --> 00:38:59.754
What kind of bullshit is that?

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:01.797
Forget the festival.
Do you all want to die?

00:39:02.381 --> 00:39:04.842
I've already told you
that you have monster cops.

00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:06.177
Okay.

00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:11.557
But you know, it turned out the detectives
Jeong Su-in mentioned aren't parasites.

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:14.018
No way.

00:39:14.894 --> 00:39:16.729
You sure you checked them both properly?

00:39:16.812 --> 00:39:18.314
I didn't check them both.

00:39:18.397 --> 00:39:20.608
But Detective Kang
is definitely not a parasite.

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:21.525
What?

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:23.194
That bastard partner cop,

00:39:23.277 --> 00:39:26.113
he's the one that killed your monster,

00:39:27.239 --> 00:39:28.699
the one in the iron mask.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.453
I saw him kill that monster
with some strange iron knife.

00:39:33.454 --> 00:39:35.081
Why did he use an iron knife?

00:39:35.664 --> 00:39:38.000
Anyway, even if that detective
isn't a monster,

00:39:38.084 --> 00:39:39.835
he's definitely on their side.

00:39:41.587 --> 00:39:43.672
Record this call starting now.

00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:46.634
If this operation is a trap,

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:48.886
then I'll be killed once I go in there.

00:39:48.969 --> 00:39:50.679
If that happens, take the recording

00:39:50.763 --> 00:39:53.307
to the Superintendent General
at the National Police Agency.

00:39:54.308 --> 00:39:56.727
-We're ready to enter, ma'am.
-Proceed.

00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:58.521
Lead Group, enter!

00:39:59.146 --> 00:40:01.107
Lead Group, moving to the strike point.

00:40:11.158 --> 00:40:11.992
Entering now!

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:14.745
Target found!

00:40:16.205 --> 00:40:17.039
Engage!

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.041
Push! Split!

00:40:22.002 --> 00:40:23.087
Runner, nine o'clock!

00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:27.133
-Terminated!
-Look up!

00:40:39.145 --> 00:40:41.939
All Grey units, enter the building
and support the Lead Group.

00:40:42.022 --> 00:40:45.693
Eliminate all threats in the way.
Zero exceptions!

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:14.805
You may pass.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.725
Go ahead and pass.

00:41:37.953 --> 00:41:39.538
Hey, what are you doing?

00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:42.041
There are too many people here.

00:41:42.583 --> 00:41:43.876
Traditionally,

00:41:44.752 --> 00:41:47.713
festivals are more fun
when there are a lot of guests, okay?

00:41:47.796 --> 00:41:49.507
No need to scare them off so soon.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.190
Is this the emotion thatâ€¦

00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:09.777
humans call "betrayal"?

00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:20.663
What are these bastards doing?

00:42:20.746 --> 00:42:21.580
Kill confirmed.

00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:26.418
All targets eliminated.

00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:28.754
Did you hear that?

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:31.966
The clean-up operation was a success.

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:33.676
As far as I know,

00:42:33.759 --> 00:42:36.053
you're the only parasite left
in the region,

00:42:36.136 --> 00:42:37.555
Jeong Su-in.

00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:41.767
Damn it.

00:42:42.768 --> 00:42:44.895
What is this? I really don't understand.

00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:47.106
What about what we saw?

00:42:47.773 --> 00:42:49.066
But the situation thereâ€¦

00:42:52.027 --> 00:42:55.864
How am I supposed to make sense of that?
Why are they killing each other?

00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:02.496
FOLK MUSIC FESTIVAL TO CELEBRATE
OPENING CHOI YONG-JAE MEMORIAL HALL

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:06.166
As someone who got backstabbed hard
by his own gang, I can tell you.

00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:11.213
You said that monster switched over
to your detective friend's body, right?

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:13.841
But what if

00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:18.012
that monster isn't simply trying
to take over another human brain

00:43:19.221 --> 00:43:22.391
but the brain of someone
who's the head of a human organization?

00:43:24.476 --> 00:43:25.311
What?

00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:28.063
He's going after the mayor's brain.

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:40.284
NAMCHEON MAYOR'S SURPRISE VISIT
