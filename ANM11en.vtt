00:02.640 --> 00:04.000
Could you be...

00:04.840 --> 00:06.850
Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi?

00:06.850 --> 00:08.530
Th-The Shogun?!

00:10.690 --> 00:15.790
We'll escort the Shogun to the safety of 
Nijo Castle with only the forces we have here.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.660
I have an idea.

00:26.410 --> 00:27.470
Huh? They split up.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.380
Which way did Iemochi go?

00:29.380 --> 00:31.780
Don't let anyone escape! After them!

00:38.340 --> 00:39.440
There they go.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.960
I see. Quite the stratagem.

00:42.130 --> 00:44.240
The Shogun! The Shogun!

00:44.680 --> 00:46.820
I love the courtly laugh.

00:47.580 --> 00:51.810
We'll count to 30, then take 
the backstreets to Nijo Castle.

00:52.110 --> 00:52.830
Right.

00:55.550 --> 00:59.900
So <i>both</i> groups were decoys?

01:00.150 --> 01:03.240
Luck really wasn't on your side.

01:03.880 --> 01:04.760
Kikuchiyo-san!

01:05.870 --> 01:06.570
Let's go.

01:06.570 --> 01:08.170
One.

01:08.460 --> 01:09.960
Two.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.550
Three.

01:18.130 --> 01:20.470
Go on. Run.

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:34.200 --> 01:39.910
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:55.640 --> 02:56.780
Halt!

03:11.160 --> 03:12.010
Hold it!

03:12.410 --> 03:13.860
Go inside! Circle ahead!

03:13.860 --> 03:14.880
Don't let 'em escape!

03:21.770 --> 03:23.560
Perfect. We've got 'em boxed in.

03:23.560 --> 03:24.760
Say your prayers, Iemochi!

03:26.230 --> 03:28.520
Haven't we bought enough time, Hijikata?

03:28.820 --> 03:29.960
No.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.270
I hate to disappoint you, 
but we can't surrender the Shogun.

03:34.110 --> 03:37.660
<b>Conquer</b>

03:35.070 --> 03:36.540
The Shogun. That's me.

03:36.540 --> 03:37.650
Damn it, old woman.

03:38.790 --> 03:41.050
Damn. He's not here.

03:41.050 --> 03:42.290
Go after the other group!

03:42.290 --> 03:43.060
Not so fast.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.040
I'll take you on.

03:48.630 --> 03:51.120
This farce was never my style.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.400
Little shit.

03:52.850 --> 03:56.880
Have it your way. I'll teach you
 how a grown man uses a sword.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.880
First, you wear it on your <i>left</i> side.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.180
Come on, draw. I ain't got all day.

04:15.350 --> 04:16.360
You...

04:16.360 --> 04:18.070
You'll pay for that!

04:25.760 --> 04:29.200
Remind me. Who's teaching whom about what?

04:30.680 --> 04:33.940
When I draw, it's already over. That's iai.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.830
C-Cocky brat.

04:36.830 --> 04:38.360
Retreat! Retreat!

04:38.360 --> 04:40.570
What? You're turning tail <i>already?</i>

04:40.570 --> 04:42.970
Try with your short swords! Well?

04:42.970 --> 04:44.320
Wait, Hajime.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.960
What's <i>your</i> problem, Hijikata?

04:46.480 --> 04:48.060
Was that man there?

04:50.430 --> 04:51.600
No. Why?

04:51.800 --> 04:52.930
Then, as we speakâ€”

04:55.060 --> 04:56.600
What is it <i>now</i>, old woman?

04:56.600 --> 04:58.240
I was scared stiff!

04:58.240 --> 05:01.020
Get off! Enough, you old bat!

05:04.820 --> 05:06.690
Hey, he dodged it!

05:08.620 --> 05:11.290
O-Okita! Get these guys!

05:11.760 --> 05:17.050
We promised to buy all the time we could
 so that Nio's group could get to Nijo Castle.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.410
That we did.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.410
We've already done plenty!

05:20.680 --> 05:22.230
I am your Shogun.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.630
When are you gonna drop that act?

05:26.260 --> 05:27.760
This guy's a fake!

05:27.760 --> 05:29.090
He's not Iemochi!

05:29.380 --> 05:30.480
They caught on.

05:30.710 --> 05:33.670
H-Hurry up and clobber these guys.

05:34.010 --> 05:36.440
I am your Shogun. I do not brawl.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.720
Give it a rest. You're plenty tough!

05:40.300 --> 05:41.880
Guess I've got no choice.

05:42.540 --> 05:43.730
I'll make them talk.

05:44.860 --> 05:46.740
Hey, at least put down your lantern.

05:46.910 --> 05:49.990
You think you're hot shit? Die!

06:03.310 --> 06:06.060
I cut your tendon, 
so you're not going anywhere.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.200
You see, a guy I knew in Edo 
always went for the lower legs.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.360
I put my own spin on his style.

06:13.860 --> 06:18.170
Yamanami-san told me 
they used to punish criminals this way.

06:18.730 --> 06:21.990
I call it Ashigiri: "Leg Cutter."

06:22.890 --> 06:23.990
He's a demon.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.490
Oh, dear. Your friends ran off without you.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.130
Not very nice of them.

06:30.130 --> 06:31.420
Damn it all.

06:31.420 --> 06:36.480
Oh, well. I'll get you to tell me
 all about who you guys are.

06:39.950 --> 06:42.350
He just bit through his tongue.

06:42.770 --> 06:43.820
Staunch it somehow.

06:44.010 --> 06:45.420
It's no good. It's too late.

06:45.750 --> 06:49.350
Wh-Who in the world are these people?

06:50.210 --> 06:52.010
This crap's not normal.

06:52.530 --> 06:55.530
They're all crazy. They have to be.

06:57.390 --> 06:59.400
We're almost at Nijo Castle.

07:00.010 --> 07:00.720
Indeed.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.690
No! No more! I'm exhausted!

07:05.690 --> 07:06.940
I demand a palanquin!

07:06.940 --> 07:08.830
Didn't you just say, "Indeed"?!

07:10.200 --> 07:11.840
Wh-What is it?

07:12.270 --> 07:12.970
What's wrong?

07:13.300 --> 07:14.540
I hear voices.

07:15.080 --> 07:15.820
What?

07:16.340 --> 07:17.380
Where's His Lordship?

07:18.010 --> 07:19.200
Leave no stone unturned!

07:19.200 --> 07:19.920
Yes, sir!

07:20.340 --> 07:21.780
They're from the castle.

07:21.780 --> 07:24.150
Thank goodness. They're here to save you.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.280
Hey! Over here!

07:29.320 --> 07:30.710
Is that you, My Lord?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.600
Is Your Lordship hurt?

07:33.450 --> 07:34.840
I am unharmed.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.620
He's right as rain!

07:55.070 --> 07:56.120
I don't believe it.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.420
I'm here for your head, Iemochi.

08:03.290 --> 08:05.280
Run for it, Kikuchiyo-san.

08:08.620 --> 08:09.710
I do not understand.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.580
What do you call yourself?

08:16.040 --> 08:17.330
Naozumi.

08:18.010 --> 08:21.530
Naozumi, what drives you to do such things?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.480
To "expel the barbarians"?

08:24.950 --> 08:29.100
Taking my head will not 
change our land's predicament.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.860
"Expel the barbarians"?

08:33.080 --> 08:35.860
"Expel the barbarians," he says.

08:37.550 --> 08:38.680
Am I wrong?

08:40.470 --> 08:43.000
I couldn't care less about them.

08:43.660 --> 08:45.880
<i>He doesn't want to expel the foreigners?</i>

08:46.920 --> 08:48.360
I do not understand.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.120
I ask you, then: what is it that you desire?

08:58.090 --> 09:00.260
To bring back the age of the samurai.

09:01.230 --> 09:02.310
Bring it <i>back?</i>

09:04.000 --> 09:06.930
You lot stole it from us.

09:08.270 --> 09:09.780
You Tokugawa.

09:12.580 --> 09:14.330
What are you talking about?

09:14.330 --> 09:17.370
You claim the Tokugawa robbed you?

09:17.370 --> 09:18.550
That's right.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.400
And what did we steal?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.950
A place to do battle.

09:27.480 --> 09:32.240
The founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate, 
Ieyasu, ended the Age of Warring States.

09:32.550 --> 09:35.760
He robbed us samurai of a place to fight.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.170
You mean peace displeases you?

09:51.710 --> 09:52.720
Stay still.

09:56.870 --> 09:58.350
It does displease me.

10:00.630 --> 10:04.460
Why shed blood if it can be avoided?

10:09.550 --> 10:11.900
Why keep samurai around, then?

10:13.030 --> 10:14.790
I'm strong as hell.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.360
I was born strong.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.900
Daily training made me stronger.

10:19.900 --> 10:23.600
I toured the provinces, honing my skills.

10:24.600 --> 10:30.610
What did we work ourselves to the bone
 strengthening body and spirit for?

10:30.880 --> 10:34.110
To defend the people in times of crisis.

10:36.820 --> 10:38.490
And when will that be?

10:38.800 --> 10:40.840
I come from a long line of samurai.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.760
My granddad and his granddad
 before him died

10:43.760 --> 10:48.630
between threadbare sheets without 
ever getting to show what samurai are for.

10:49.520 --> 10:56.630
For 260 years, you Tokugawa have lorded 
over the samurai and kept us useless.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.770
Tell me, boy...

11:00.770 --> 11:02.550
What's the way of the sword?

11:04.220 --> 11:06.510
I... I don't know.

11:09.600 --> 11:13.570
Tell me, Iemochi. What's the sword to you?

11:15.390 --> 11:16.480
The sword...

11:19.560 --> 11:21.210
is mere decoration.

11:22.610 --> 11:24.070
<i>He won't like that answer.</i>

11:25.800 --> 11:29.080
The sword is insurance 
lest the worst should happen.

11:34.550 --> 11:36.360
The way of the sword is blood.

11:36.730 --> 11:41.590
An unbroken lineage, 
passed down since Genji fought Heike.

11:42.180 --> 11:44.210
Why don't you try to fight?

11:44.750 --> 11:47.740
Why don't you try to show off your strength?

11:50.260 --> 11:52.970
Fighting is synonymous with dying.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.480
I suggest you mistrust any who urge battle,

11:57.480 --> 12:01.150
no matter what pretty phrases
 they dress it up in.

12:04.420 --> 12:08.920
<i>This</i> is the lord of all samurai? What a joke.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.530
When the great rot, the lesser go hungry.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.640
There's a big war coming.

12:15.980 --> 12:18.840
We, the Blood Risshidan, 
are going to start it.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.980
<i>"The Blood Risshidan"?</i>

12:22.480 --> 12:26.200
Iemochi, your head will do nicely.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.560
It will make the perfect centerpiece 
for the coming festival.

12:30.830 --> 12:34.660
Your death will throw the city into chaos 
and the country into violence.

12:34.660 --> 12:36.720
The Warring States will come again.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.570
That's when we'll find the
 place where we belong.

12:41.350 --> 12:44.360
<i>Damn it. It's hopeless.
 He really means it.</i>

12:45.010 --> 12:46.360
Listen, Naozumi.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.830
Even so, I will not allow you to make war.

12:51.470 --> 12:55.080
That is my verdict as 
leader of the samurai clans.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.090
I will not die.

12:58.590 --> 13:00.320
I cannot die now.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.220
No.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.760
You're gonna die.

13:06.740 --> 13:09.420
Right here. Right now.

13:12.700 --> 13:13.520
Nio?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.930
We need to escape, Kikuchiyo-san.

13:18.930 --> 13:20.050
Please run!

13:24.770 --> 13:26.600
How feeble.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.310
Playtime is over.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.530
What's your plan?

13:32.530 --> 13:34.080
I have an idea.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.270
So you've dropped your sword in surrender?

14:12.170 --> 14:13.080
Naozumi-san...

14:16.070 --> 14:17.220
You're weak.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.040
Where's Iemochi?

14:21.650 --> 14:22.670
I won't...

14:23.930 --> 14:24.880
give him up!

14:32.560 --> 14:36.760
The man in white wasn't with 
the group that chased you, either?

14:36.760 --> 14:38.280
Not a chance.

14:38.890 --> 14:42.250
I was so relieved we didn't have
 to deal with that nightmare.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.580
But nobody scares me more than Okita.

14:47.230 --> 14:51.570
In that case, I'm worried about 
Nio-kun and the Shogun.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.010
What now?

14:53.010 --> 14:54.720
Do we head back to the dango shop?

14:54.720 --> 14:56.960
C-Can I leave now?

14:57.290 --> 15:00.060
Taro! You should be ashamed of yourself!

15:00.060 --> 15:03.580
But you said I was 
more cut out for business!

15:03.890 --> 15:08.590
Even shopkeepers have to 
stand their ground sometimes.

15:13.460 --> 15:14.850
We'll go to Nijo Castle.

15:16.780 --> 15:21.100
The man in white may have rallied 
the men who fled to beat us there.

15:22.210 --> 15:24.430
That seems likely.

15:24.940 --> 15:29.240
I mean, the Shogun has 
to go there eventually.

15:29.640 --> 15:34.470
We'll check every likely spot 
for an ambush near the castle.

15:34.470 --> 15:35.530
That's more like it!

15:35.740 --> 15:37.640
I'll lend you a hand!

15:38.510 --> 15:41.200
Come along, Taro. Shape up, will you?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.440
Seriously?

15:43.080 --> 15:43.890
Hurry.

15:43.890 --> 15:44.530
You got it.

15:51.280 --> 15:55.550
Sure, I'm worried about Nio, 
but what can <i>I</i> do?

15:55.910 --> 15:57.800
Can't I just go home?

15:58.150 --> 15:59.470
What do you say, Hijikata?

16:00.210 --> 16:02.280
Huh? What?

16:03.070 --> 16:05.360
Hey! Hijikata's gone!

16:05.840 --> 16:09.340
Well, yeah. He ran on ahead. 
We'd better catch up.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.410
Huh?

16:11.410 --> 16:13.370
Ah, of all the...

16:16.260 --> 16:18.480
No fair, Hijikata-san.

16:25.430 --> 16:27.370
So Iemochi's through here?

16:31.880 --> 16:37.130
By the way, unless my ears are playing tricks, 
I think you just called me weak.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.160
I did.

16:38.470 --> 16:41.590
Kikuchiyo-san is stronger than you.

16:43.070 --> 16:46.270
A mighty man like me?

16:47.290 --> 16:48.240
<i>Calm down.</i>

16:48.610 --> 16:50.680
<i>Don't let him see you feeling hopeless.</i>

16:51.810 --> 16:54.400
Did I scare you out of your wits?

16:54.680 --> 16:58.220
<i>I've watched the Miburo enough to tell...</i>

16:59.250 --> 17:02.600
<i>just how terribly strong
 and dangerous he is.</i>

17:03.920 --> 17:05.680
<i>I came into this with only one goal:</i>

17:06.520 --> 17:08.670
<i>to fight with the weapons I have!</i>

17:10.660 --> 17:12.490
You say you want to fight a war.

17:13.870 --> 17:15.290
You say that's what samurai do.

17:15.290 --> 17:20.230
That's right. Samurai fight 
and die on the battlefield.

17:20.510 --> 17:21.940
That's why you're weak.

17:22.930 --> 17:24.680
I don't follow.

17:25.120 --> 17:29.190
Don't you think it's selfish? What about 
the people who get dragged into your war?

17:30.250 --> 17:35.790
The women? The elderly? The invalids?

17:36.890 --> 17:37.800
The children?

17:40.200 --> 17:43.530
Kikuchiyo-san is putting himself
 in all of their shoes,

17:43.530 --> 17:46.800
and wondering what he can do 
to make things better.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.430
He's looking at the bigger picture.

17:50.240 --> 17:54.480
Clinging to your samurai status 
makes you weaker than he is.

17:55.060 --> 17:56.550
You can't beat him!

17:58.110 --> 18:00.810
That's enough chitchat.

18:01.660 --> 18:04.850
<i>A counterweight? Don't tell me 
he has a chain and sickle.</i>

18:05.600 --> 18:09.320
<i>He's bluffing. 
No kid could handle one of those.</i>

18:10.450 --> 18:12.850
<i>Still, he did throw away his sword.</i>

18:12.850 --> 18:15.980
<i>It makes sense to assume 
he has a better weapon.</i>

18:18.160 --> 18:23.240
<i>He </i>has<i> been hiding his left side 
ever since I caught up to him.</i>

18:24.810 --> 18:27.800
<i>And it's too dark to get a good look.</i>

18:29.430 --> 18:32.230
Of course, none of that matters.

18:32.840 --> 18:35.020
My sword can reach him.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.800
And kill him.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.470
<i>Now!</i>

18:40.660 --> 18:41.560
A rock?

18:45.210 --> 18:48.160
A rock? A rock, huh?

18:48.160 --> 18:50.480
Bluffing to buy time, are you?

18:50.480 --> 18:53.310
I admire your guts.

18:53.780 --> 18:59.180
And you know, it's not so easy to swing
 my long sword in this narrow alley.

18:59.890 --> 19:02.330
You've really thought this through.

19:04.750 --> 19:09.450
But I don't have to <i>swing</i> it.

19:09.930 --> 19:11.820
How do you like this?

19:19.710 --> 19:21.150
I've been waiting for this!

19:21.640 --> 19:22.740
I've got you!

19:23.660 --> 19:25.840
Now you can't use your sword!

19:28.120 --> 19:30.090
What's your game?

19:30.880 --> 19:32.720
Kikuchiyo-san is stronger than you!

19:34.550 --> 19:36.110
What'd you say?

19:38.070 --> 19:39.360
I barely felt that.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.110
It... It won't work.

19:45.690 --> 19:47.390
Looks like it's working to me.

19:56.040 --> 20:01.250
Will you die by my fist?
Or let go and die by my sword?

20:01.960 --> 20:05.260
I'll never let go. Never.

20:09.910 --> 20:12.240
I'll knock you out for good.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.740
I'll never let go.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.750
I'll never let go!

20:23.750 --> 20:25.360
You'll never beat me!

20:26.640 --> 20:28.480
You're still saying that?

20:29.850 --> 20:30.870
<i>You really...</i>

20:33.290 --> 20:34.770
<i>are strong.</i>

20:37.550 --> 20:41.280
<i>I could never beat you.</i>

20:42.760 --> 20:43.720
<i>But...</i>

20:45.050 --> 20:47.280
<i>If I let go now,</i>

20:49.130 --> 20:51.720
<i>I won't be able to prove...</i>

20:52.940 --> 20:54.270
She's tough.

20:54.690 --> 20:58.360
I guess the sword isn't 
the only way to be strong.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.930
<i>I know, right?</i>

21:02.440 --> 21:06.140
<i>Hajime-kun, I feel the same way.</i>

21:07.840 --> 21:13.330
But I believe there are steps only a
 powerless, incompetent Shogun can take.

21:17.290 --> 21:19.050
<i>Something tells me...</i>

21:19.960 --> 21:23.960
<i>that deep down, Kikuchiyo-san's 
strength is a lot like Granny's.</i>

21:25.100 --> 21:27.420
Even so, I will not allow you to make war.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.560
That is my verdict as 
leader of the samurai clans.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.570
<i>I have to prove that.</i>

21:37.320 --> 21:39.310
<i>Prove the truly strong one...</i>

21:42.120 --> 21:43.920
<i>is Kikuchiyo-san!</i>

21:45.070 --> 21:50.080
<b>True Strength</b>

23:20.160 --> 23:25.550
<b>Next time</b>

23:21.720 --> 23:23.270
Hijikata Toshizo here.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.710
We managed to drive off 
the assassins on our tails,

23:27.200 --> 23:29.840
but that man in white wasn't with them.

23:31.020 --> 23:33.970
I don't like leaving 
Lord Iemochi in Nio's charge.

23:34.750 --> 23:37.720
Making for Nijo Castle is our best move now.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.840
That said...

23:40.780 --> 23:43.520
Sorry, Soji. My mind's made up.

23:44.670 --> 23:46.650
Next time: "Eight Heads."

23:46.940 --> 23:48.920
Watch. That's all.

23:47.190 --> 23:50.070
<b>Eight Heads</b>
