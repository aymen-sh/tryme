00:06.320 --> 00:08.480
I'll never let go. Never.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.700
I'll never let go.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.120
I'll never let go!

00:14.390 --> 00:16.110
You're still saying that?

00:26.370 --> 00:27.410
There.

00:27.970 --> 00:29.150
Around that corner...

00:33.940 --> 00:36.020
There it is. Nijo Castle.

00:50.820 --> 00:55.370
Follow this street, then take the first right
and you'll be on Oike-dori Street.

00:55.370 --> 00:59.120
Follow that street to the canal, 
and you'll see Nijo Castle on your right.

00:59.420 --> 01:00.110
Right.

01:00.570 --> 01:02.160
And what will you do, Nio?

01:03.050 --> 01:05.790
I'll stall Naozumi-san to buy you time.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.330
No, I won't have that. 
He's simply too dangerous.

01:09.820 --> 01:10.810
I'll be fine.

01:11.070 --> 01:13.600
Whatever else I am, I'm a Miburo.

01:16.100 --> 01:18.770
No, no! I'm scared to go alone!

01:18.770 --> 01:23.650
Please be reasonable! If he gets you, 
this will all have been for nothing!

01:24.790 --> 01:29.190
<i>I ought to summon reinforcements and 
rush to his aid, even if it takes some time.</i>

01:30.160 --> 01:32.110
<i>I know that as well as anyone.</i>

01:32.970 --> 01:34.140
<i>I know it, and yet...</i>

01:38.320 --> 01:39.570
This will not do.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.760
It simply will not.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.730
Forgive me, Nio.

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:56.220 --> 02:01.930
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

03:16.960 --> 03:18.310
Enough!

03:19.690 --> 03:21.440
Let go already, brat!

03:21.440 --> 03:22.470
Never!

03:23.550 --> 03:24.420
Naozumi!

03:29.810 --> 03:31.680
I insist that you stop this.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.490
Kikuchiyo-san!

03:35.920 --> 03:37.480
Oh?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.090
Sorry, Nio.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.000
I cannot be the only one to flee.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.240
In that sense, I suppose 
I'm not cut out to rule.

03:49.130 --> 03:50.880
<i>You really are...</i>

03:52.590 --> 03:54.080
<i>the Shogun.</i>

03:55.590 --> 04:00.250
You came back here to die? 
Saves me the trouble of coming to find you.

04:04.050 --> 04:07.080
I may not look it, 
but I am the Seii Taishogun.

04:08.080 --> 04:12.150
I have d-dabbled in swordplay myself.

04:16.430 --> 04:20.690
You're quaking! You're the 
very picture of cowardice!

04:23.440 --> 04:26.820
R-Run, Kikuchiyo-san.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.870
I... I cannot.

04:30.510 --> 04:33.520
D-D-Do your worst.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.210
No.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.660
Your Lordship has done enough.

04:40.090 --> 04:41.080
You are...

04:46.650 --> 04:48.030
Hijikata-san!

04:54.070 --> 04:57.240
Now <i>you</i> look like you can 
give me a little entertainment.

04:58.940 --> 04:59.810
Let go.

04:59.810 --> 05:00.610
No!

05:00.610 --> 05:02.400
Please let go of me!

05:01.640 --> 05:02.400
No!

05:02.680 --> 05:03.450
No!

05:05.760 --> 05:07.660
Oh, give it a rest already!

05:08.640 --> 05:09.950
You must be a Miburo.

05:16.450 --> 05:20.920
No warning? You're as wild as the rumors say.

05:23.380 --> 05:24.710
Whoa there.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.200
Where are you from?

05:29.200 --> 05:30.640
How old are you?

05:30.640 --> 05:31.610
Well?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.430
What, are you angry?

05:34.830 --> 05:36.480
What style do you practice?

05:52.290 --> 05:54.960
What awesome strength.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.200
<i>Th-That's Hijikata-san for you.</i>

05:58.480 --> 06:00.840
Do you ever stop yapping?

06:01.200 --> 06:03.460
I've got nothing to say to you.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.990
Sorry. Bad habit of mine.

06:17.990 --> 06:22.820
<i>I haven't met a man worth fighting 
in a while, and I got carried away.</i>

06:23.720 --> 06:25.320
Nio, can you move?

06:26.530 --> 06:29.100
Escort His Lordship to Nijo Castle.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.410
Yes, sir.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.540
Ow, ouch.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.780
Let me help you.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.450
S-Sorry.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.280
Can you walk?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.200
I'm fine.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.680
Let's take this way around.

06:49.000 --> 06:49.680
Sure.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.400
Will that fellow be all right?

06:52.940 --> 06:54.510
Should we not call for help?

06:55.070 --> 06:56.400
Don't worry about him.

06:57.050 --> 07:00.930
We'd catch hell for it later 
if we called for help instead of escaping.

07:02.230 --> 07:05.330
And I can't imagine Hijikata-san losing.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.160
There's more to come!

07:19.970 --> 07:21.680
Deftly struck.

07:22.070 --> 07:25.460
I see you've got skill as well as strength.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.000
Your strikes are too direct.

07:28.600 --> 07:32.270
Although between that funny sword 
and this narrow alley, I can't blame you.

07:32.270 --> 07:37.010
I've found it. I knew you were no ordinary man.

07:37.010 --> 07:37.760
Huh?

07:39.080 --> 07:42.570
Anyway, are you sure you want
 to let them go that easily?

07:42.990 --> 07:44.600
Trivialities.

07:45.040 --> 07:49.080
We really ought to talk. I'm sure of it.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.010
What?

07:50.910 --> 07:56.740
You said you've got nothing to say. 
But don't be like that. Tell me about yourself.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.040
How about a little story 
about me to break the ice?

08:04.330 --> 08:05.080
Shut up.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.460
I don't care about your backstory.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.640
That stings.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.070
You seem to be enjoying this.

08:17.070 --> 08:25.650
I really am. I hear you Miburo are a pack of 
ronin from Edo who settled in Mibu Village.

08:25.650 --> 08:27.020
You heard right.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.020
Then you must understand.

08:29.370 --> 08:30.630
Understand what?

08:34.550 --> 08:38.190
Didn't you come here to make your names?

08:38.190 --> 08:42.280
To live by the sword? To prove your worth?

08:43.850 --> 08:46.550
Well, maybe some of us did.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.640
But not me.

08:49.640 --> 08:50.490
What?

08:51.140 --> 08:54.300
Then why did you come?

08:57.240 --> 09:02.310
Ever heard the saying, "We all repay a lifetime
 of debt to our parents by the age of three"?

09:02.450 --> 09:03.310
News to me.

09:03.770 --> 09:08.970
It means babies are so lovable, 
you can forget about what comes after.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.810
As it happens, I'm an exception.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.980
I was the youngest of ten, 
so I got a lot of affection.

09:18.980 --> 09:22.080
And not just from my parents.

09:33.840 --> 09:41.070
My brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, 
and everyone in the village loved me.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.350
L-Loved you?

09:45.620 --> 09:48.770
So you see, I owed too much.

09:49.340 --> 09:50.890
I just want to pay my debts.

09:53.010 --> 09:56.810
When I heard there were guys 
like you running wild in Kyoto,

09:57.320 --> 10:01.670
I figured people must be in trouble.
Possibly crying their eyes out.

10:02.710 --> 10:07.330
Whoever they are, I want to do 
something for them. That's all.

10:10.280 --> 10:16.140
Of course, no matter how many times I say it,
 none of the other Miburo believe me.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.200
Do you know why?

10:19.790 --> 10:22.730
Because I've got a mean face like you.

10:24.380 --> 10:25.510
I see.

10:27.570 --> 10:29.600
I get it. I know just what you mean.

10:30.040 --> 10:34.080
Fighting for the weak 
is one aspect of a samurai.

10:34.310 --> 10:36.940
So that's your bushido, huh?

10:37.460 --> 10:38.540
Bushido?

10:39.760 --> 10:41.780
Tell me, brother.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.430
You should be able to answer me.

10:45.120 --> 10:49.210
What is the way of the sword to you? Tell me.

10:49.590 --> 10:51.560
The sword? You mean the way of the samurai?

10:52.160 --> 10:56.000
Yes! The ideal we strive for.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.960
It's a delusion.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.000
Is His Lordship still missing?

11:15.200 --> 11:16.880
Whatever it takes, find him!

11:16.880 --> 11:17.600
Yes, sir!

11:18.320 --> 11:21.780
W-We made it. There's Nijo Castle.

11:21.780 --> 11:23.830
W-We survived.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.240
They say Nio and the Shogun
 haven't arrived yet.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.270
What now?

11:32.580 --> 11:34.350
That's a tricky question.

11:35.460 --> 11:37.310
And who knows where Hijikata went!

11:37.310 --> 11:40.160
They're dead! It's all over!

11:40.160 --> 11:42.650
Quit your whining, Taro.

11:42.650 --> 11:43.930
Hey!

11:45.830 --> 11:48.220
We're over here, guys!

11:48.220 --> 11:50.190
It is I. I have returned.

11:50.650 --> 11:52.670
It's Nio. And the Shogun, too.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.970
You're all right.

11:53.970 --> 11:55.080
You're alive?

11:55.080 --> 11:56.190
Took you long enough.

11:57.860 --> 12:01.510
I, uh, wasn't worried. Not one bit.

12:01.510 --> 12:02.520
Seriously?

12:02.520 --> 12:06.000
Still, I'm glad. You both made 
it here in one piece—

12:07.210 --> 12:11.270
Yes. Thank goodness 
we got through that safely.

12:11.270 --> 12:13.710
Indeed. We faced 
no trouble worth mentioning.

12:13.940 --> 12:16.750
Whoa! You got beat to hell and back!

12:17.430 --> 12:18.960
Someone got you good.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.430
Was it that guy?

12:20.680 --> 12:23.000
Yeah. Naozumi-san found us and—

12:23.460 --> 12:26.340
Don't use "san" for the enemy!

12:27.800 --> 12:29.560
How happy-go-lucky can you get?

12:30.240 --> 12:31.280
Lord Iemochi!

12:31.280 --> 12:32.670
You've returned.

12:32.670 --> 12:34.310
My lord, are you hurt?

12:34.650 --> 12:37.320
Merely a few scratches. Do not fuss.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.480
You're covered in blood!

12:40.480 --> 12:41.900
Damn those scoundrels!

12:41.900 --> 12:43.820
We'll make them pay!

12:44.120 --> 12:44.820
Shogun.

12:44.820 --> 12:46.170
What? You dare—

12:46.170 --> 12:46.820
Madam.

12:47.110 --> 12:48.960
Did Nio work hard?

12:49.780 --> 12:53.830
Yes. He did indeed. 
He is a splendid worker.

12:56.340 --> 13:00.080
You did good, Nio. 
Well done. What a man.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.340
Ow. That hurts, Granny.

13:02.540 --> 13:05.000
I knew you'd come through when it counted.

13:06.130 --> 13:07.760
That's the bare minimum.

13:07.970 --> 13:13.420
Still, they would've had <i>all</i> our heads 
if he'd let the Shogun die.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.890
Nio, you're a hero!

13:18.920 --> 13:20.460
You're all exaggerating.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.070
No, I mean it.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.620
By the way, did you see Hijikata?

13:24.840 --> 13:27.070
He went looking for you.

13:27.360 --> 13:31.920
Oh, don't worry. 
Hijikata-san is fighting Naozumi-san.

13:31.920 --> 13:32.690
Where?

13:32.690 --> 13:33.680
By now, he should be...

13:36.780 --> 13:39.670
Hey! Where are they fighting?

13:39.670 --> 13:42.890
At least name the place 
before passing out on us.

13:42.890 --> 13:46.340
The battlefield is on
 Oike-dori Street. Go, Miburo.

13:46.490 --> 13:47.320
Got it.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.080
I wonder if they're still going at it.

13:49.350 --> 13:50.740
Guess we'd better go see.

13:52.170 --> 13:54.650
I will take Nio inside. Open the gates.

13:55.730 --> 13:59.220
Two of my guards were cut down 
in the street. Send someone for them.

13:59.220 --> 13:59.920
Yes, my lord.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.040
And summon a doctor at once.

14:02.040 --> 14:02.950
Yes, my lord.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.770
O-Okay, guys, good luck!

14:05.770 --> 14:06.580
Don't get beat—

14:06.580 --> 14:07.800
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

14:07.800 --> 14:09.830
You're going with them, Taro!

14:10.020 --> 14:13.900
Your friends are fighting, so do your part.

14:15.790 --> 14:18.880
Let's go. Those guys are nuts.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.560
The way of the sword is a delusion?

14:22.910 --> 14:23.660
You heard me.

14:36.470 --> 14:37.690
Cheap piece of junk.

14:37.890 --> 14:41.200
The fight's over. Back to our talk.

14:41.630 --> 14:46.450
Why? Why would a samurai 
like you say such a thing?

14:48.620 --> 14:51.140
It sounds like there is 
some misunderstanding.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.870
I am no samurai.

14:52.870 --> 14:53.700
What?

14:57.110 --> 14:59.010
Then what are you?

14:59.010 --> 15:01.210
Just a farmer's son.

15:02.420 --> 15:03.280
Impossible!

15:03.280 --> 15:07.580
A p-peasant? <i>You?</i> Lies!

15:07.580 --> 15:09.040
Stop lying!

15:12.560 --> 15:15.600
A wakizashi? You wish to continue?

15:15.830 --> 15:18.480
What can you do with that toy?

15:25.140 --> 15:26.780
A test of strength, is it?

15:27.340 --> 15:30.940
Did you think you could 
cross blades with me and win?

15:31.850 --> 15:32.440
What?

15:39.050 --> 15:40.590
You punched me?

15:40.590 --> 15:42.960
Is that any way to fight?

15:43.320 --> 15:45.960
Don't act like this is some exhibition duel.

15:46.460 --> 15:48.470
We're brawling, plain and simple.

15:49.690 --> 15:51.080
You want a brawl?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.890
Let go!

16:08.400 --> 16:10.080
No, <i>you</i> let go!

16:10.440 --> 16:11.820
I'll murder you!

16:10.440 --> 16:11.820
I'll murder you!

16:12.330 --> 16:14.000
You want to keep going?

16:17.980 --> 16:20.210
<i>When did that guy get here?</i>

16:29.760 --> 16:31.720
That's hardly beautiful.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.480
Not beautiful in the least.

16:35.170 --> 16:36.840
Who are you?

16:37.890 --> 16:38.940
Good evening.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.250
Naozumi, that sword of yours 
won't do any good here.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.720
You must know that.

16:45.890 --> 16:46.840
<i>A new enemy?</i>

16:47.370 --> 16:49.470
Damn you, Ayame.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.770
I'll be the one to kill you.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.560
Why aren't you wearing your Risshi uniform?

16:57.560 --> 17:01.890
Oh, come on. I'd stick out like a 
sore thumb walking around in that.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.120
How stupid can you be?

17:04.120 --> 17:05.420
Do you recognize this flower?

17:06.110 --> 17:09.130
It's called a "rose," 
and I hear it has thorns.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.600
Just like me.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.390
You'll stand out even more in that!

17:16.270 --> 17:20.120
You have potential, 
but unfortunately, you lack polish.

17:20.650 --> 17:22.290
Who are you people?

17:23.620 --> 17:24.640
How many are you?

17:25.050 --> 17:31.640
According to the <i>Nihon Shoki</i>, the great serpent,
 Yamata no Orochi, had eight heads.

17:33.330 --> 17:35.170
Eight heads.

17:35.170 --> 17:37.570
Namely, the Lily...

17:38.160 --> 17:48.420
the Pure, the Agitator, the Hound, the Quiet,
 the Fiend, the Firework Maker, and...

17:49.340 --> 17:50.180
the Samurai.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.410
What are you after?

17:53.410 --> 17:55.430
I'm glad you asked.

17:55.810 --> 17:57.590
We, the Blood Risshidan, will—

17:57.590 --> 17:59.250
Hey! There they are!

18:00.240 --> 18:02.430
Hijikata-san!

18:04.160 --> 18:05.630
<i>What rotten timing.</i>

18:07.890 --> 18:09.190
Oh, my.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.280
Huh?

18:11.900 --> 18:13.410
Oh, my. What's this?

18:13.880 --> 18:16.720
Are you in trouble, by any chance?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.510
Seriously? Come on, man.

18:18.510 --> 18:19.690
Whoa.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.950
Why don't you just finish them off already?

18:24.180 --> 18:25.320
They're Miburo.

18:26.450 --> 18:29.200
Hijikata, we're ready to join in anytime.

18:29.580 --> 18:32.200
This proves you still need to train more.

18:33.330 --> 18:35.280
There's more of them now.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.210
Do something, Hijikata!

18:38.000 --> 18:38.970
Quiet!

18:39.280 --> 18:42.350
Uh-oh. He's getting beat. Lame.

18:43.890 --> 18:47.600
Well, well. All your friends 
are here to watch.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.930
If you cross this line, the fighting starts.

18:54.430 --> 18:57.610
Do you want to settle this here or not?

18:57.610 --> 18:59.110
What?

19:04.620 --> 19:08.120
G-Go on, Hajime. Get 'em.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.830
No, I think we'll pass for today.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.720
I see.

19:16.430 --> 19:19.670
Yes. The light just isn't right today.

19:23.670 --> 19:25.120
Let's go, Naozumi.

19:25.120 --> 19:25.850
Huh?

19:26.180 --> 19:27.580
That's how it goes.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.690
Don't make decisions for me.

19:31.020 --> 19:33.280
Your sword's bent.

19:33.280 --> 19:33.910
What?

19:38.880 --> 19:39.640
Hey.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.700
This fight's not over.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.450
What do you call yourself?

19:50.540 --> 19:52.240
Hijikata Toshizo.

19:53.490 --> 19:55.720
Kyohachi Naozumi.

19:56.190 --> 19:58.170
Till we meet again.

19:59.780 --> 20:03.040
Ask the white-haired kid what we want.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.720
Shouldn't we have taken them on
 while we had the chance?

20:07.100 --> 20:08.480
Y-Yeah.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.560
You sure we wanna let them go?

20:10.560 --> 20:12.230
Pipe down.

20:12.560 --> 20:17.390
Wow, though. That Naozumi guy seemed tough.

20:17.930 --> 20:19.920
I'll settle the score sooner or later.

20:20.730 --> 20:21.880
More importantly, Soji...

20:22.950 --> 20:25.360
Don't give too much thought 
to what doesn't concern you.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.790
Whatever do you mean?

20:30.590 --> 20:34.870
That Hijikata guy must 
be awfully important.

20:35.330 --> 20:35.960
Huh?

20:36.530 --> 20:40.530
I didn't really care whether
 we went at it or not,

20:41.560 --> 20:45.050
but given where he was standing, 
he would have died for certain if we had.

20:46.610 --> 20:52.360
That pretty boy weighed up the benefits 
of capturing us and decided not to fight.

20:53.470 --> 20:56.310
It looked like the rest of them
 wanted to fight, though.

20:57.050 --> 20:59.280
Hijikata is my prey.

20:59.660 --> 21:01.560
If you touch him, I'll kill you.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.050
Oh, I'm <i>so</i> scared.

21:13.370 --> 21:14.550
Naozumi-san...

21:15.590 --> 21:17.000
You're weak.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.200
What is it?

21:23.220 --> 21:26.380
Still, I liked that white-haired kid.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.920
They're an interesting bunch.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.640
Really?

21:31.870 --> 21:33.080
The Miburo, is it?

21:35.230 --> 21:36.320
Yeah.

21:39.110 --> 21:43.770
That settles it. 
They'll be the stars of the festival.

21:44.940 --> 21:49.950
<b>Eight Heads</b>

23:20.080 --> 23:25.460
<b>Next time</b>

23:21.320 --> 23:26.960
A clash between the Miburo 
and the Blood Risshidan seems inevitable.

23:27.460 --> 23:30.800
Meanwhile, having successfully
 protected Lord Iemochi,

23:30.800 --> 23:36.050
Nio is carried into Nijo Castle 
and gains unlooked-for experience.

23:36.590 --> 23:43.490
For the Miburo, it would become 
a newfound cause for unity.

23:44.330 --> 23:47.660
Next time: "Sharing the Same Dream."

23:47.110 --> 23:49.940
<b>Sharing</b>

23:47.110 --> 23:49.940
<b>the 
Same 
Dream</b>

23:47.980 --> 23:49.290
It won't disappoint.
