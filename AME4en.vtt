00:04.120 --> 00:05.420
<b><i>No matter when I look,</i></b>

00:05.500 --> 00:07.750
<b><i>the night sky is always beautiful.</i></b>

00:08.920 --> 00:10.090
<b><i>So why…</i></b>

00:27.440 --> 00:31.820
<b>Why must our world be an ugly place?</b>

00:32.320 --> 00:36.360
<b>It's because the Earth
is at the center of the universe.</b>

00:36.950 --> 00:39.870
<b>But wouldn't that make it special?</b>

00:40.450 --> 00:42.450
<b>To be at the center</b>

00:42.540 --> 00:44.960
<b>is to be at the bottom.</b>

00:45.460 --> 00:49.130
<b><i>At every location on Earth,</i></b>

00:49.210 --> 00:51.460
<b><i>heavy objects fall downward.</i></b>

00:51.960 --> 00:53.880
<b><i>That is because Earth's center</i></b>

00:53.970 --> 00:56.970
<b>is the lowest point in the universe.</b>

00:57.470 --> 01:00.510
<b>That's how God created things.</b>

01:01.220 --> 01:02.640
<b>But why?</b>

01:03.220 --> 01:05.890
<b>God made the Earth
a lowly place full of corruption</b>

01:06.480 --> 01:11.610
<b>to remind us that humankind
is helpless and sinful.</b>

01:12.110 --> 01:15.990
<b>The sky above looks so beautiful</b>

01:16.070 --> 01:19.370
<b>because you are gazing at it
from this corrupt realm.</b>

01:20.620 --> 01:23.200
<b>If Earth is at the bottom of the universe,</b>

01:23.700 --> 01:26.370
<b>why don't the stars fall from the sky?</b>

01:27.790 --> 01:29.210
<b>I don't know.</b>

01:29.290 --> 01:33.550
<b>We humans can only comprehend
the realm in which we live.</b>

01:34.130 --> 01:37.680
<b>The heavens are sublime, solemn,</b>

01:37.760 --> 01:39.890
<b>sacred, and sweeping.</b>

01:39.970 --> 01:43.470
<b>They don't mingle with the lowly Earth.</b>

01:56.110 --> 01:59.030
<b>Sorry. Have I kept you waiting, Oczy?</b>

01:59.110 --> 02:00.990
<b>Not at all, Gras.</b>

02:01.780 --> 02:05.080
<b>The stars look so beautiful
on such a clear night.</b>

02:05.580 --> 02:07.460
<b>It never fails to amaze me!</b>

02:08.040 --> 02:11.710
<b>Every evening, the stars share
the rich splendor of their glow.</b>

02:13.960 --> 02:15.550
<b>Don't you ever have a look?</b>

02:16.050 --> 02:18.760
<b>With your eyes,
I'm sure the stars are quite vivid.</b>

02:19.260 --> 02:21.180
<b>No, uh… I…</b>

02:22.930 --> 02:25.100
<b>I don't like to gaze at the sky.</b>

02:26.220 --> 02:27.180
<b>I see.</b>

02:27.810 --> 02:29.190
<b>Oh, that's right!</b>

02:29.270 --> 02:32.860
<b>Today marks one year
since you transferred to our chapter.</b>

02:33.440 --> 02:35.650
<b>When work is done, let's celebrate.</b>

02:36.150 --> 02:38.240
<b>My treat, of course.</b>

02:38.320 --> 02:40.490
<b>Oh, uh… Thank you very much.</b>

02:44.370 --> 02:46.700
<b>Now then. Let's get to work.</b>

03:10.270 --> 03:12.770
<b>ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH</b>

04:18.960 --> 04:24.180
<b>EPISODE FOUR: THE FACT THAT THIS WORLD
IS FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HEAVEN</b>

04:27.760 --> 04:28.720
<b>I'll do it.</b>

04:29.220 --> 04:30.140
<b>Thanks.</b>

04:32.480 --> 04:34.440
<b>We're members of the Civilian Watch.</b>

04:35.100 --> 04:37.610
<b>I will serve as witness.</b>

04:38.190 --> 04:40.690
<b>Please allow us to wear masks</b>

04:41.190 --> 04:43.490
<b>so that we may avoid personal retribution.</b>

04:46.950 --> 04:49.160
<b>Now, let's begin.</b>

04:55.290 --> 04:56.370
<b>Commence the duel.</b>

05:16.230 --> 05:17.060
<b>W-Wait!</b>

05:17.650 --> 05:20.820
<b>It was Count Nastula
who I challenged to a duel!</b>

05:20.900 --> 05:25.650
<b>Why does someone of my stature
have to fight you peasants?</b>

05:26.240 --> 05:28.200
<b>Count Nastula hired us</b>

05:28.280 --> 05:31.330
<b>to fight as his champions.</b>

05:32.240 --> 05:35.040
<b>I believe you approved it too.</b>

05:36.910 --> 05:39.000
<b>B-But if I…</b>

05:39.750 --> 05:42.050
<b>If I lose, I'll die!</b>

05:42.130 --> 05:44.670
<b>Correct. That's the way it works.</b>

05:51.390 --> 05:52.760
<b><i>Gotcha!</i></b>

06:08.700 --> 06:10.700
<b>N-No…</b>

06:10.780 --> 06:12.330
<b>I don't want to die.</b>

06:13.660 --> 06:15.830
<b>I know! I have money!</b>

06:15.910 --> 06:17.000
<b>Let's make a deal!</b>

06:17.580 --> 06:20.120
<b>You have nothing against me, right?</b>

06:20.210 --> 06:22.710
<b>Murder is a terrible sin!</b>

06:22.790 --> 06:25.380
<b>You don't really want to do this, do you?</b>

06:26.170 --> 06:27.170
<b>Well…</b>

06:27.260 --> 06:30.010
<b>To be honest, I really don't.</b>

06:30.090 --> 06:31.470
<b>I-In that case--</b>

06:33.810 --> 06:35.350
<b>But this is my job.</b>

06:43.360 --> 06:46.360
<b>B-Burn…</b>

06:48.320 --> 06:49.780
<b>in…</b>

06:50.530 --> 06:51.570
<b>hell.</b>

07:01.750 --> 07:03.380
<b>I've handed over the body.</b>

07:04.090 --> 07:06.420
<b>That takes care of tonight's work.</b>

07:07.000 --> 07:09.300
<b>Still, your reflexes impress me.</b>

07:09.380 --> 07:11.010
<b>You really do have good eyes.</b>

07:12.090 --> 07:13.890
<b>Huh? Are you okay?</b>

07:14.890 --> 07:18.470
<b>D-Do you think he went to heaven?</b>

07:21.270 --> 07:22.270
<b>You're concerned?</b>

07:23.270 --> 07:24.560
<b>I'm worried.</b>

07:25.060 --> 07:28.820
<b>Doing this work, I've seen
many people face imminent death.</b>

07:29.820 --> 07:33.450
<b>But not a single one
seemed to die in satisfaction.</b>

07:35.410 --> 07:38.120
<b>They all passed away in terror.</b>

07:39.290 --> 07:41.710
<b>As if they saw the entrance to hell.</b>

07:43.120 --> 07:47.630
<b>Could it be that
only a handful of people go to heaven?</b>

07:48.130 --> 07:51.300
<b>If so, a murderer like me
will never make it.</b>

07:52.300 --> 07:53.130
<b>Oczy.</b>

07:53.630 --> 07:56.220
<b>What do you like best about our world?</b>

07:57.810 --> 07:59.520
<b>Why ask me that?</b>

08:00.520 --> 08:03.900
<b>It's inappropriate to like anything
about this corrupt realm.</b>

08:03.980 --> 08:05.770
<b>Come on, that's not true!</b>

08:05.860 --> 08:07.610
<b>Enjoyment can't be bad.</b>

08:08.270 --> 08:09.900
<b>With nothing to look forward to,</b>

08:09.980 --> 08:13.110
<b>our souls plunge instantly into darkness.</b>

08:13.200 --> 08:15.820
<b>Things like love, dreams, and hope</b>

08:15.910 --> 08:18.370
<b>should never be cast aside!</b>

08:20.830 --> 08:23.000
<b>I guess you're right.</b>

08:23.790 --> 08:25.630
<b>I'll rethink my outlook.</b>

08:26.830 --> 08:28.250
<b>Oh, sorry.</b>

08:28.340 --> 08:30.510
<b>I've made you nervous.</b>

08:30.590 --> 08:34.050
<b>Please be frank,
and tell me what you really think.</b>

08:34.550 --> 08:37.350
<b>But… my opinion doesn't matter.</b>

08:37.430 --> 08:39.260
<b>Don't be so shy!</b>

08:39.350 --> 08:41.020
<b>We've known each other for a year.</b>

08:41.100 --> 08:42.730
<b>Don't hold back!</b>

08:50.320 --> 08:52.820
<b>I believe expectations
are bound to be betrayed.</b>

08:52.900 --> 08:56.360
<b>You'll be less hurt if you give up
from the very beginning.</b>

08:56.450 --> 09:00.700
<b>Or rather, nothing enjoyable
ever happens in life anyway.</b>

09:00.790 --> 09:02.700
<b>The only ones who can be happy</b>

09:02.790 --> 09:05.830
<b>are a select few born with that privilege.</b>

09:06.420 --> 09:10.420
<b>For those who aren't chosen,
even trying to be happy is useless.</b>

09:10.500 --> 09:11.340
<b>Our world is sick.</b>

09:11.420 --> 09:12.920
<b>And that's why</b>

09:13.010 --> 09:14.920
<b>the only hope is in heaven.</b>

09:15.010 --> 09:18.050
<b>Heaven is wonderful.</b>

09:18.140 --> 09:20.930
<b>I wanna go now.</b>

09:26.140 --> 09:27.310
<b>Just kidding.</b>

09:27.400 --> 09:29.060
<b>In other words,</b>

09:29.150 --> 09:32.020
<b>because there's nothing
perfect or eternal here,</b>

09:32.110 --> 09:33.650
<b>you can't trust anything?</b>

09:34.150 --> 09:35.900
<b>No, I--</b>

09:35.990 --> 09:36.900
<b>I get it!</b>

09:37.410 --> 09:38.360
<b>In truth,</b>

09:38.450 --> 09:41.200
<b>I was just like you not long ago.</b>

09:41.780 --> 09:44.080
<b>But then I found it.</b>

09:44.750 --> 09:47.040
<b>Something worthy of absolute hope.</b>

09:48.290 --> 09:49.210
<b>Wanna know what?</b>

09:49.290 --> 09:50.920
<b>No, not particularly.</b>

09:51.000 --> 09:53.630
<b>This time, you can feign interest.</b>

09:56.050 --> 09:57.550
<b>I want to know.</b>

10:00.890 --> 10:04.020
<b>-Hey, those guys…
-Yeah, they're assassins.</b>

10:04.100 --> 10:05.430
<b>Here we are.</b>

10:05.520 --> 10:07.020
<b>Two cups of wine, please!</b>

10:07.100 --> 10:07.940
<b>Huh?</b>

10:08.020 --> 10:11.110
<b>This tavern is frequented by the nobility.</b>

10:11.190 --> 10:13.900
<b>Duelists like you should leave.</b>

10:13.980 --> 10:16.570
<b>I'm sorry if we've offended you.</b>

10:17.070 --> 10:21.030
<b>However, this tavern
is also open to us guild members.</b>

10:21.620 --> 10:23.490
<b>So I hope you'll allow us to stay.</b>

10:23.580 --> 10:26.000
<b>-You've got it wrong, Gras.
-Huh?</b>

10:26.080 --> 10:28.910
<b>With people like him,
you have to be more direct.</b>

10:32.290 --> 10:35.670
<b>I'm sorry for being born!</b>

10:35.760 --> 10:37.760
<b>C-Cut it out! That's enough!</b>

10:37.840 --> 10:39.090
<b>I'm sorry for being born!</b>

10:40.180 --> 10:44.560
<b>See? If you apologize sincerely,
they'll forgive you.</b>

10:45.060 --> 10:46.470
<b>Uh, right.</b>

10:46.560 --> 10:48.060
<b>Thanks for that.</b>

10:49.060 --> 10:51.690
<b>Now then. Let's pick up where we left off.</b>

10:51.770 --> 10:52.690
<b>Left off?</b>

10:52.770 --> 10:54.690
<b>Huh? You know!</b>

10:54.770 --> 10:57.150
<b>We were talking about the hope I found.</b>

10:57.650 --> 11:00.450
<b>Oh, right. Of course, I remember.</b>

11:05.740 --> 11:07.200
<b>Here it is.</b>

11:07.870 --> 11:09.790
<b>It contains my observations of Mars.</b>

11:10.290 --> 11:11.460
<b>Mars?</b>

11:11.960 --> 11:13.000
<b>What's that?</b>

11:13.710 --> 11:15.590
<b>I guess we start there, huh?</b>

11:17.130 --> 11:19.300
<b><i>You're aware that the constellations</i></b>

11:19.380 --> 11:21.550
<b><i>are always arranged the same, right?</i></b>

11:21.630 --> 11:23.430
<b><i>Their appearance never changes,</i></b>

11:23.510 --> 11:25.760
<b><i>and every night,</i>
<i>they move from east to west</i></b>

11:25.850 --> 11:27.350
<b><i>until morning comes.</i></b>

11:28.310 --> 11:30.100
<b>But one day,</b>

11:30.180 --> 11:32.650
<b><i>as I was looking aimlessly</i>
<i>up at the stars,</i></b>

11:32.730 --> 11:34.690
<b><i>I noticed something incredible.</i></b>

11:35.820 --> 11:38.690
<b><i>Among the fixed constellations in the sky,</i></b>

11:38.780 --> 11:40.360
<b><i>some stars move!</i></b>

11:41.400 --> 11:43.910
<b>They move ever so slightly
in a single night.</b>

11:43.990 --> 11:46.330
<b>But if you watch for days,</b>

11:46.410 --> 11:48.290
<b>their positions clearly change!</b>

11:48.870 --> 11:50.200
<b>I was fascinated,</b>

11:50.290 --> 11:51.960
<b>so I asked a monk.</b>

11:52.830 --> 11:55.290
<b>The moving stars are called "planets,"</b>

11:55.380 --> 11:57.710
<b>and I learned there are as many as five.</b>

11:58.710 --> 12:02.550
<b><i>The one I found</i>
<i>had the most obvious movements of all.</i></b>

12:02.630 --> 12:05.720
<b><i>It's a planet called Mars,</i>
<i>and it has a fiery red glow.</i></b>

12:06.220 --> 12:07.760
<b><i>From that day on,</i></b>

12:07.850 --> 12:10.140
<b><i>I decided to record</i>
<i>the trajectory of Mars.</i></b>

12:10.730 --> 12:12.230
<b><i>And what did I find?</i></b>

12:12.730 --> 12:16.310
<b><i>Mars moves through</i>
<i>the constellations in a circular path!</i></b>

12:16.400 --> 12:18.610
<b><i>For one month, six months, or a year,</i></b>

12:18.690 --> 12:22.110
<b><i>its circular orbit continues without fail.</i></b>

12:22.740 --> 12:26.070
<b>Swaying grass,
flowing rivers, wavering flames…</b>

12:26.660 --> 12:28.950
<b>There are many things that move in nature,</b>

12:29.030 --> 12:31.750
<b>but none as consistently as this.</b>

12:32.250 --> 12:34.080
<b>It is true perfection!</b>

12:34.170 --> 12:35.880
<b>Then I realized something.</b>

12:35.960 --> 12:38.750
<b>This world certainly is
corrupt and disorderly.</b>

12:38.840 --> 12:42.010
<b>It could never match
the grand perfection of the sky.</b>

12:42.090 --> 12:46.510
<b>Even so, we can still
gaze at that perfection!</b>

12:46.590 --> 12:48.850
<b>Humankind can recognize perfect things.</b>

12:48.930 --> 12:52.480
<b>And unlike the sun,
we can look at Mars directly.</b>

12:52.560 --> 12:55.850
<b>The Earth gives us the best seats
in the house for observation.</b>

12:55.940 --> 12:59.440
<b>Looking at it that way,
humankind and the Earth aren't so bad.</b>

13:00.940 --> 13:04.610
<b>Thanks to that realization,
I feel positive about everything!</b>

13:04.700 --> 13:07.110
<b>And now, after two years of observation,</b>

13:07.200 --> 13:10.620
<b><i>the orbit of Mars</i>
<i>will complete its circle.</i></b>

13:10.700 --> 13:13.580
<b>The grand finale will soon be here!</b>

13:15.210 --> 13:17.170
<b>Oh? Wow.</b>

13:17.670 --> 13:19.670
<b><i>That's a pretty big stretch.</i></b>

13:19.750 --> 13:21.920
<b>That's a pretty big stretch.</b>

13:23.050 --> 13:25.090
<b>It must take a lot of will.</b>

13:25.840 --> 13:28.720
<b>The perfect circular path of Mars?</b>

13:28.800 --> 13:32.430
<b>I envy you peasants and your ignorance.</b>

13:33.060 --> 13:36.560
<b>I'm sorry to draw your attention again,</b>

13:36.640 --> 13:39.230
<b>but nothing you say
will change how I feel.</b>

13:39.730 --> 13:41.480
<b>Go ahead and laugh all you want.</b>

13:41.570 --> 13:44.360
<b>No, I'm sorry for interrupting.</b>

13:44.440 --> 13:46.450
<b>Feel free to enjoy yourselves.</b>

13:47.240 --> 13:50.780
<b>However, you did choose
the wrong time to begin observation.</b>

13:50.870 --> 13:53.450
<b>Otherwise, you would have noticed sooner.</b>

13:54.830 --> 13:56.290
<b>Whatever you say.</b>

14:00.960 --> 14:02.800
<b>Th-This can't be!</b>

14:05.300 --> 14:06.470
<b>What's wrong?</b>

14:08.050 --> 14:08.930
<b>Every day…</b>

14:09.430 --> 14:12.350
<b>It moved every day for the past two years.</b>

14:13.430 --> 14:14.720
<b>Lately,</b>

14:14.810 --> 14:18.020
<b>I'd noticed that
the movements seemed slower.</b>

14:19.400 --> 14:20.730
<b>But today…</b>

14:21.440 --> 14:23.230
<b>Mars went completely still.</b>

14:24.610 --> 14:26.940
<b>It hasn't moved at all since yesterday.</b>

14:27.950 --> 14:29.610
<b>How could this be?</b>

14:30.990 --> 14:34.870
<b>I waited two years,
and it was about to complete its circle.</b>

14:36.250 --> 14:38.960
<b>Why?</b>

14:45.880 --> 14:47.670
<b>Hey, Oczy!</b>

14:48.840 --> 14:50.300
<b>Done with work?</b>

14:50.800 --> 14:53.140
<b>No, I'm on my way now.</b>

14:53.850 --> 14:55.810
<b>It must be tough</b>

14:55.890 --> 14:58.770
<b>being paired with a weirdo like Gras.</b>

14:58.850 --> 15:00.190
<b>Not at all.</b>

15:00.270 --> 15:02.480
<b>He's a very optimistic person.</b>

15:02.560 --> 15:04.110
<b>That's the problem!</b>

15:07.110 --> 15:08.610
<b>Gras used to be</b>

15:08.690 --> 15:11.280
<b>a fairly average guy.</b>

15:11.360 --> 15:13.820
<b>He complained as much as anyone.</b>

15:14.830 --> 15:15.950
<b>But at one point,</b>

15:16.040 --> 15:18.700
<b>his entire family died of the plague.</b>

15:19.830 --> 15:20.660
<b>That was when</b>

15:20.750 --> 15:24.880
<b>he lost all hope
and tried to end his own life.</b>

15:24.960 --> 15:27.760
<b>H-His life has been that tragic?</b>

15:29.420 --> 15:33.010
<b><i>The biggest tragedy</i>
<i>was that he failed to die.</i></b>

15:35.760 --> 15:38.520
<b><i>The Church forgave him for that sin,</i></b>

15:39.100 --> 15:42.020
<b><i>but the truth is that</i>
<i>he regretted having survived.</i></b>

15:42.100 --> 15:45.190
<b><i>He said, "Is this really my fate?"</i></b>

15:46.110 --> 15:50.240
<b><i>But then, over the past year or two,</i>
<i>he's suddenly grown cheerful.</i></b>

15:50.320 --> 15:51.610
<b><i>When I asked him why,</i></b>

15:51.700 --> 15:53.530
<b><i>he said he'd been stargazing.</i></b>

15:54.030 --> 15:57.990
<b><i>"The stars are a message</i>
<i>from my family in heaven," he said.</i></b>

15:58.580 --> 15:59.870
<b><i>Be careful.</i></b>

15:59.950 --> 16:03.250
<b><i>Unstable people like him</i>
<i>are unpredictable.</i></b>

16:05.830 --> 16:07.880
<b>Things like love, dreams, and hope</b>

16:07.960 --> 16:10.380
<b>should never be cast aside!</b>

16:20.430 --> 16:21.480
<b>It bent.</b>

16:23.810 --> 16:24.980
<b>It bent</b>

16:25.480 --> 16:27.150
<b>in the opposite direction.</b>

16:29.650 --> 16:31.990
<b>The perfect circle is broken.</b>

16:33.490 --> 16:35.700
<b>It's hideously deformed.</b>

16:44.120 --> 16:45.210
<b>Is this really</b>

16:45.710 --> 16:48.290
<b>my fate?</b>

16:57.010 --> 16:57.970
<b>Good evening.</b>

16:58.050 --> 17:00.310
<b>Hello. Shall we go?</b>

17:04.140 --> 17:06.190
<b>Will there be no stargazing tonight?</b>

17:06.770 --> 17:07.860
<b>Well…</b>

17:08.360 --> 17:09.770
<b>As you said,</b>

17:09.860 --> 17:13.190
<b>maybe it's a mistake to expect
something from this world,</b>

17:13.280 --> 17:15.570
<b>rather than from heaven.</b>

17:18.120 --> 17:20.490
<b>Anyway, today's task is…</b>

17:21.790 --> 17:23.120
<b>Now there's a change.</b>

17:23.200 --> 17:25.160
<b>We're guarding the transport of a heretic.</b>

17:25.250 --> 17:27.080
<b>A h-heretic?!</b>

17:27.170 --> 17:29.250
<b>They may be communing with the devil.</b>

17:29.750 --> 17:31.750
<b>-Better be careful!
-Huh?</b>

17:33.170 --> 17:35.090
<b>Are you from the Civilian Watch?</b>

17:37.630 --> 17:40.180
<b>I'm the inquisitor, Damian.</b>

17:52.940 --> 17:55.360
<b>The men from the Watch are here.</b>

17:55.440 --> 17:57.780
<b>Let's go, Nowak.</b>

17:58.610 --> 18:00.240
<b>What are you looking at?</b>

18:00.320 --> 18:01.660
<b>A charm.</b>

18:04.450 --> 18:06.910
<b>I guess the boring shift begins now.</b>

18:15.420 --> 18:17.760
<b>Is it okay to remove your mask?</b>

18:19.680 --> 18:22.680
<b>There's no harm in being seen
by a heretic who's about to die.</b>

18:23.350 --> 18:24.890
<b>Oh? I see.</b>

18:26.230 --> 18:28.190
<b>How unfortunate that it should be raining.</b>

18:28.690 --> 18:30.770
<b>It means I can't see the stars.</b>

18:36.320 --> 18:38.820
<b>Aren't you two
interested in the night sky?</b>

18:39.490 --> 18:41.950
<b>Stargazing can be quite relaxing.</b>

18:43.240 --> 18:44.280
<b>We're not allowed</b>

18:44.370 --> 18:46.950
<b>to speak with you.</b>

18:47.040 --> 18:49.040
<b>Could you remain quiet?</b>

18:49.920 --> 18:52.040
<b>Will you strike me if I don't?</b>

18:52.540 --> 18:56.130
<b>To tell the truth,
I pity you too much to hit you.</b>

18:56.920 --> 19:00.470
<b>Why defy the very church
that brings you salvation?</b>

19:01.050 --> 19:04.470
<b>Why would you give up
your own place in heaven?</b>

19:06.310 --> 19:09.140
<b>Unfortunately for you,
execution is unavoidable.</b>

19:09.640 --> 19:13.190
<b>But you could still reconsider
and recant before you die.</b>

19:14.770 --> 19:16.280
<b>How merciful of you.</b>

19:16.940 --> 19:20.280
<b>But you're the ones who should reconsider.</b>

19:21.280 --> 19:24.160
<b>Will the Church
really bring you salvation?</b>

19:24.240 --> 19:29.080
<b>More importantly, does the heaven
they speak of really exist?</b>

19:32.170 --> 19:34.590
<b>A heretic like you would never understand.</b>

19:34.670 --> 19:38.170
<b>And what exactly do <i>you </i>understand?</b>

19:38.670 --> 19:42.550
<b>You all turn blindly to heaven</b>

19:42.630 --> 19:46.180
<b>as a way to escape
the hopelessness of this world.</b>

19:48.560 --> 19:50.310
<b>We know what you're trying to do.</b>

19:50.390 --> 19:52.850
<b>You're playing on our anxieties,</b>

19:52.940 --> 19:55.860
<b>so you can push us toward despair.</b>

19:56.570 --> 19:57.820
<b>No.</b>

19:58.400 --> 20:01.820
<b>You're the ones pushing despair away.</b>

20:03.280 --> 20:04.620
<b>The philosophy of today</b>

20:04.700 --> 20:09.910
<b>was born when an elderly Athenian drank
from a poisoned chalice 2,000 years ago.</b>

20:10.410 --> 20:15.000
<b>The Church of today grew from grief
over a young man's crucifixion</b>

20:15.080 --> 20:17.420
<b>1,500 years ago.</b>

20:17.920 --> 20:20.260
<b>Humankind is known to produce new hope</b>

20:20.340 --> 20:23.090
<b>from the ashes of tragedy.</b>

20:24.430 --> 20:26.800
<b>Temporary relief from pain</b>

20:26.890 --> 20:28.680
<b>will never change reality.</b>

20:28.760 --> 20:31.430
<b>But primal suffering,</b>

20:31.520 --> 20:33.770
<b>seething frustration,</b>

20:33.850 --> 20:35.770
<b>or even your own despair</b>

20:35.850 --> 20:38.320
<b>can be turned into hope.</b>

20:38.400 --> 20:41.400
<b>Yet, you close your eyes to that despair</b>

20:41.490 --> 20:45.280
<b>and turn instead to the thirdhand
guarantee of life after death.</b>

20:45.360 --> 20:48.700
<b>Hope will never smile
upon people like you.</b>

20:50.790 --> 20:53.000
<b>I've had enough of your drivel!</b>

20:53.080 --> 20:54.330
<b>You know nothing!</b>

20:54.410 --> 20:56.330
<b>Gras, get a hold of yourself!</b>

20:56.420 --> 20:58.290
<b>Don't fall for the heretic's trap!</b>

20:59.460 --> 21:00.420
<b>"Heretic," huh?</b>

21:00.920 --> 21:05.340
<b>I know all too well why you fear
people who are called that.</b>

21:05.430 --> 21:08.970
<b>It's not because you don't understand me.</b>

21:09.050 --> 21:10.180
<b>It's the opposite.</b>

21:10.930 --> 21:12.390
<b>Deep down,</b>

21:12.470 --> 21:16.350
<b>you yourselves do not
fully believe in heaven.</b>

21:16.440 --> 21:18.730
<b>You don't speak for me.</b>

21:19.310 --> 21:23.440
<b>In fact, there is no heaven,
and death is the end.</b>

21:23.530 --> 21:25.110
<b>Isn't that what you think?</b>

21:25.200 --> 21:26.610
<b>It's not.</b>

21:26.700 --> 21:29.070
<b>I understand why you worry.</b>

21:29.160 --> 21:31.870
<b>Losing your appointment
in the afterlife is hard.</b>

21:31.950 --> 21:33.750
<b>Don't say another word.</b>

21:33.830 --> 21:35.330
<b>But in fact, you…</b>

21:35.410 --> 21:38.380
<b>No, all humankind
should confront that possibility.</b>

21:38.460 --> 21:39.500
<b>Stop it.</b>

21:39.580 --> 21:41.670
<b>The simple possibility</b>

21:41.750 --> 21:44.340
<b>that your beautiful heaven doesn't exist!</b>

21:44.970 --> 21:46.800
<b>I asked you to stop!</b>

21:48.930 --> 21:54.180
<b>Worse, you ignore the fact that this world
is far more beautiful than heaven.</b>

21:58.480 --> 21:59.310
<b>What are you--</b>

21:59.400 --> 22:02.070
<b>You want to believe it too, don't you?</b>

22:02.770 --> 22:06.950
<b>That this world
is a wonderful place worth living on.</b>

22:10.910 --> 22:13.200
<b>Forget it. That's enough.</b>

22:13.290 --> 22:14.330
<b>It's ridiculous.</b>

22:14.830 --> 22:17.830
<b>If we stop and think,
it's all baseless rambling.</b>

22:18.670 --> 22:20.080
<b>I have evidence.</b>

22:20.170 --> 22:21.380
<b>Is that so?</b>

22:21.880 --> 22:23.630
<b>Well, you don't have it here.</b>

22:24.130 --> 22:26.340
<b>No, it's right at this spot.</b>

22:27.420 --> 22:29.840
<b>Right on that mountain you see now.</b>

22:30.930 --> 22:32.890
<b>All the evidence</b>

22:32.970 --> 22:36.220
<b>is in a stone chest
hidden on the mountainside.</b>

22:36.930 --> 22:40.440
<b>Now, do you understand
the position you're in?</b>

22:41.440 --> 22:45.230
<b>On this very night,
you two have been given</b>

22:45.320 --> 22:47.240
<b>the momentary chance</b>

22:47.320 --> 22:51.030
<b>to change your own lives
for the first time.</b>

22:52.160 --> 22:55.330
<b>Will you stick to the comfort
of lifelong self-denial?</b>

22:55.410 --> 22:58.960
<b>Or will you risk everything
for self-affirmation?</b>

22:59.460 --> 23:02.580
<b>The choice is yours.</b>

23:02.670 --> 23:05.090
<b>So, what will it be?</b>

23:06.960 --> 23:08.880
<b>A-As if…</b>

23:11.970 --> 23:12.800
<b>Huh?</b>

23:22.980 --> 23:23.810
<b>Please.</b>
