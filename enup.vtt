WEBVTT

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:49.901
Mm.

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:56.199
So, uh, do you start all your meetings off

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.868
by killing the other person's friends?

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.454
- Well, I, um...
- I know this one.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:05.124
- What?
- You must read Machiavelli, right?

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.669
Why would you assume
that I've read Machiavelli?

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.880
Because that move
that you pulled out there

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:13.967
was very Machiavellian.

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:16.594
I don't know if Machiavellian
is the way I would describe it.

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:21.015
"A lion cannot protect himself from traps

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:26.312
and the fox cannot defend himself
from wolves.

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:32.735
One must therefore be a fox
to recognize traps

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:35.823
and a lion to frighten wolves."

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:39.409
- Pretty clever, huh?
- Sure.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.702
Can we move on now?

00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:41.953
Please. Please.

00:02:41.954 --> 00:02:44.414
Do you know how much
I get paid, Mr. Barrett?

00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:45.708
Not enough.

00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:49.085
- But I know how much you get paid.
- No, you don't.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:50.628
Well, I can assume.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.756
You know what they say
about assuming, right?

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:57.094
Oh, is... is this a Machiavelli thing?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.638
Never mind. Continue.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.016
You came from Spain.

00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:05.810
You took over your predecessor's
failed organization

00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:08.480
and you turned it around on my turf.

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.190
Now I want a cut of that:

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.859
15 percent.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.278
I expect to be paid
at the end of each month.

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:19.574
And in exchange, I will keep you
and your organization protected.

00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:22.161
Now here is my only problem.

00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:25.580
You killed six of my men.

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:50.396
- You killed three of mine.
- Well, we aren't exactly even.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.856
This isn't about the numbers.

00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:54.692
But I am talking now
and you are in my office.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.655
Uh, be a little respectful.

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:00.782
I've been doing perfectly fine

00:04:00.783 --> 00:04:03.284
without any help from you people.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:06.371
Ah, but, you have had help from us.

00:04:06.372 --> 00:04:08.665
- Hmm?
- How do you think I found you?

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:11.626
And the agency is cracking down
on officers taking bribes.

00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:14.337
And I've been made
head of the task force in charge of that.

00:04:14.338 --> 00:04:15.505
Huh.

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:19.801
Well, I found your boys,
Officers McGrath and Long, correct?

00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:21.844
They flipped before I even said a word.

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.973
So the reality is, you never had access

00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:26.808
to someone on the inside like me,

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:29.936
and I've never had access
to money like yours.

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:33.148
So... yeah?

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.486
So, sorry about your men,
but uh, well, you'll be compensated plenty

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:42.323
when you're running your business
without so much as a traffic ticket.

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:45.743
Now of course all this,
this is just a formality

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.080
because you really don't have a choice.

00:04:48.664 --> 00:04:51.374
Because if you say no,
I still have three dead officers

00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:52.375
to bring against you.

00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:56.463
Oh, fuck.

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:02.177
I don't wanna work with you.
I think you are insufferable.

00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:07.474
Oh, for fuck's sake.

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:11.769
So... we leave it up to God.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.940
Now if I pull this trigger and you die,

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.568
then it wasn't meant to be
and I'll deal with the consequences,

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.572
but if I pull the trigger
and you don't die,

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:25.784
- then we will be very happy together.
- All right.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.162
Just in case, any last words or something?

00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:30.330
Nope.

00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:32.124
No? Great.

00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:37.588
I look forward to working with you.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.257
Now give me a hug. Come on!

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:44.178
Welcome to the organization.

00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:53.599
Chill out, Danny.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.476
I can't chill out.
We're stealing Gabriel's money.

00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:11.366
Stash it in the fireplace and take a seat.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.077
- Shall we do this?
- He pays us shit.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.621
We've earned this.

00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:19.166
We get the passcode from 'em
and we're home free.

00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:38.100
My mum would kill me
if I didn't feed you.

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:40.561
We don't have the time. We got shit to do.

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:41.855
Shit to do?

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:45.234
- It's almost midnight.
- I don't know. I could eat.

00:08:45.901 --> 00:08:47.485
Where's this from?
Nino's.

00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:49.153
Huh. Is Nino's open this late?

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.947
Nah, we called in a favor.

00:08:50.948 --> 00:08:53.658
A knife and fork, are you kidding me?

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:56.119
Eh, it's greasy. I'm wearing my nice coat.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:59.623
Worst pizza Nino's ever made.
It tastes like shit.

00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:01.249
Get the case now.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.171
Where's my money, Gabriel?

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:13.094
Listen, fellas, how long
have I been paying for immunity here?

00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:15.596
- Four years?
- Three. And I would argue it's the reason

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:18.724
that you've been able to continue building
this little empire of yours.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:22.938
Three years and you still don't trust me.

00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:25.107
You are still a criminal, Gabriel.

00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:29.485
I realize you are new to this enterprise,

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:32.822
but I would question
the hypocrisy of that claim.

00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:35.574
Now, I want to read you something.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.909
Oh, God.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.120
You ever read Machiavelli, Garland?

00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:42.248
It's Officer Garland, and yes.

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:46.127
I live by this shit. I love it.

00:09:46.128 --> 00:09:48.463
Everybody fucking loves it.

00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:54.635
"He who becomes a prince
through the favor of the people

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:58.098
should always keep
on good terms with them.”

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.100
I don't understand the relevance of this.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.185
He's saying he should stay
on good terms with us

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.939
since he became a prince
through your favor.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:10.943
Where's my money?

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.528
You'll get it.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.322
You've been saying that for a month now.

00:10:14.323 --> 00:10:15.364
You know...

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.366
I'm not screwing you here.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:21.203
If I wanted out, I would kill you both

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:24.832
right here, right now in this instant!

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:25.875
No, you wouldn't.

00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:27.961
Agency would be down on you
like a ton of bricks.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:32.840
What a ridiculous thing to say, man.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:37.011
Do you seriously think
that if I shot you right now,

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.306
that anybody would care? No.

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:46.520
But if I did, then I would have to find
two more crooked officers

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:50.525
and that's a hassle I don't have
the time to deal with!

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:54.278
So full of shit, Gabriel.
I know you're smarter than that.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.114
"Everyone sees what you appear to be.

00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:59.909
Few experience what you really are."

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.203
Don't tell me. Machiavelli?

00:11:02.204 --> 00:11:05.664
Yeah. So, I have men picking up the money

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.167
from one of my safe houses tonight,

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:11.505
so expect the money by morning.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.093
Please leave me alone.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.596
I'm hungry.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.640
Well, fucking hell.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.433
All right.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.269
I guess this is how we're doing it.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.063
Hands on the table.

00:11:28.647 --> 00:11:29.731
You're making a mistake.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:33.402
If you would've asked me five minutes ago,
I would've said you were wrong.

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.405
- So you agree?
- Yeah.

00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:39.908
Because I didn't think about how long
poison would take to kick in.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.453
You're bluffing.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:48.166
Just give us the case code
and you can run off to the hospital.

00:11:51.128 --> 00:11:52.128
You're both dead.

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:56.549
If Gabriel doesn't kill you
for stealing from him, the officers will.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.384
The officers?

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.887
Yeah, you cunt,
who'd you think we work for?

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.764
The money's a bribe for the SCA.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.475
You're stealing from everyone.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.210
Good. Oh, my God.

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.903
Fuck.

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.451
Fuck! It's hot! Hot! Hot!

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:48.578
What?

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.580
No, I'm not in pain.

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.500
I just burned my fucking hand off.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.711
Good morning, Siobhan,
what do you want, girl?

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:58.547
Mm-hmm?

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:00.214
Yeah.

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:02.968
What? Now?

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.513
All right, all right,
keep your fucking hair on. I'm coming.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.476
Good morning, love.

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:13.353
Good morning.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.940
Fuck.

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:22.027
Meg, we have to go. Siobhan's outside.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.028
Come on.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.868
Come on, come on, come on.

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:31.496
Morning.

00:14:31.497 --> 00:14:32.497
- Hey.
- Morning.

00:14:32.498 --> 00:14:33.914
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:35.541
- How stoned are you today, huh?
- Ugh.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.460
I've told him he can't live
in the van anymore if he keeps this up.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.421
You're the best sponsor a guy can have.

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:42.381
Ah, she tries.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.800
I try and I try.

00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:45.844
It's a nice sponge, Charlie.

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:48.304
Fucking bollocks.

00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:50.472
Fuck. Fuck me, it's hot.

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:54.268
One of these days, they'll come back
to the scene of the crime and kill us all.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:56.103
Don't worry about it, Siobhan.

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.105
We got Charlie fucking Bronson
here to protect us.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:59.481
Don't we, Charlie?

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:01.651
Hey, mate, I've always wanted to ask you.

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.153
- What did you do in the army?
- Shh!

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:06.865
Eh, eh, eh, Chuck,
we've got blood to clean up.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.076
Oh, that's fucking scary, man.

00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:11.619
Oh, yeah.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:16.041
Hey, there's a chance
the room might be bugged.

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.418
- Just letting you know.
- Yeah, thank you.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:23.922
Oi, Meg. Why the fuck
did you tell him that for?

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.384
There's nothing wrong
with having a little fun.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.510
Take fucking these.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:29.553
He's a junkie.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:32.306
He doesn't need to have any more fun
than he's already fucking having.

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:35.018
He's having your fun, my fun,
get a fucking wiggle on.

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:37.645
Fucking fun?

00:15:37.646 --> 00:15:41.274
A fucking blow job and a bowl of
fucking corn flakes would have been fun.

00:15:53.662 --> 00:15:55.287
How are the kids, Siobhan?

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.791
Eh, wish I never had them.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:02.379
Yeah, well, you chose to adopt them.

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.131
I didn't know
they'd be arseholes.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:09.343
Yes, you did. Hey, why don't you adopt me?

00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:11.346
I always need a new mummy.

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.889
But I know you're an arsehole.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.394
Couldn't get into university,
now you're stuck doing this shite.

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.688
When we get married,
we'll open our funeral home,

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:23.107
Meagan and Alex's Funeral Home.

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:26.819
Do you know what? We could call it:
“The Good Death Funeral Home.”

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.030
What do think, Siobhan? Do you wanna
invest a little bit of money in me fam?

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.115
Come on, mummy.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.909
What do you say, Siobhan?
Ah, ah, ah. I'm the reason

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.077
the two of you are together.

00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:37.664
My involvement here is done.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.583
I am fucked.

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:49.591
Did you just do coke?

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.719
Hey, Al, don't you know
there's a difference

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.098
between coming to work high
and getting high on the job?

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:58.726
Right, first of all,
this is not fucking coke.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.728
- This is smelling salts.
- Oh, well, so sorry.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:05.065
You know like wakey-wakey eggs and bakey.
You made me miss my cup of tea, mummy.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.650
Oh, so it's all my fault, eh?

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.402
Yeah, actually it is, yeah.

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:10.529
Just quit that sniveling shit out.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.824
Shh.

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:14.784
It's snowing.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.994
Hey, Shivs?
Huh?

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.079
You've gotta seriously think
about changing the name

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.333
- of your fucking cleaning company.
- I know.

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.668
Hey, Charlie.
Huh?

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.879
You found any government spyware yet?

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.338
No, not yet, but...

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:29.799
Shh.

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:33.928
- Well, you just keep looking, sweetheart.
- Okay.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.307
You're a fucking arsehole.

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.857
Whoa.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.818
Oh, shit.

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:56.117
- That whistle for us, Chuck?
- Yeah.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:17:59.579
Did you actually find something?

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:01.790
Fuck off.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:06.168
Did you two set him up to this?
Yeah, but it was a joke.

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:07.754
You can't joke with Chuck.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.007
I'll take a look, all right?

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.219
All right.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:20.016
What the fuck?

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.229
Siobhan?
Hmm?

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.980
There's a fucking suitcase in the chimney.

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:28.608
Well, pull it out.

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:31.401
All right.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.241
Fucking hell.

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:49.086
- What the fuck is that?
- Not our business.

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:51.964
We'll just hand it back to the peelers,
tell them they suck at their job.

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:55.467
Hold on. What if there's something
really exciting in this case?

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.302
All the more, not my problem.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:01.391
Meagan, we don't know
what's in this fucking suitcase.

00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:04.142
And we don't know who it belongs to.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:07.020
What if it's money? Let's say
it's a life-changing amount of money.

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:09.064
You could retire,
I could open a funeral home,

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.525
Alex could propose to me
because I've been waiting five years,

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:14.028
but he's too focused
on all of this to pull the trigger.

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:15.571
Siobhan?

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.074
If that's your game, take the case.

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:20.409
I want nothing to do with it.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.536
Everyone, back to work.

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:24.831
Right. Good work, hey.

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:09.500
All righty then, that's it
for this bloody house.

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:14.964
Give me the case.

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:18.509
- Is it yours?
- You police?

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.094
No, I didn't think so.

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:23.889
I don't get paid enough for this.
Come on, this goes to...

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.602
- Hand it over.
- Get out of my way.

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:30.812
Look, just give me the case
and I'll be on my way.

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.982
I'll give you a case.
Oh, God.

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:43.034
Hey, Siobhan,
do you wanna fucking stop this?

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:56.004
Who the fuck is that?

00:20:56.005 --> 00:20:58.591
Fuck me.

00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:09.601
Well, Siobhan,
it would seem you're involved in this now.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.646
- What, are you stupid?
- No.

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:15.107
This goes back to the peelers
straight away.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.693
- No cops.
- Why not?

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.488
Shh.

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:24.783
- Oh, fucking beautiful.
- No, no, no, it's not what you think.

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:26.201
This is cycling.

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:28.412
It's the gift of welfare
that keeps on giving.

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:30.664
- Yeah, I know.
- You got those smelling salts?

00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:33.418
- Yeah, I got the fucking smelling salts.
- Well, get on with it.

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:38.296
Here.

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.799
Take a great, big sniff of that.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.344
Look at me, look at me.

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:46.264
- Do you know where you are?
- Yeah.

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:50.018
Then get up off
the fucking floor, all right? Come on.

00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:53.146
Up, Chuck.

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:56.733
Fucking hell.

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.819
- Is this...?
- It's not your blood.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.405
Off into the garden with you,
we don't have all day.

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:07.452
This is what our life has come to.

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:09.036
Yeah.

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:11.747
My dreams died a long time ago.

00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:14.458
Well, it's never too late
to give up on your old dreams

00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:16.586
and focus on the new ones.

00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:21.173
Right now my only dream is to marry you.

00:22:21.174 --> 00:22:22.924
All I'm saying is the longer we wait,

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:25.343
the less chance we have
of having a family.

00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:28.764
Well, we can always adopt
a couple of bastards like Siobhan did.

00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:29.807
Huh?

00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:32.477
Isn't that right, Siobhan?

00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:35.688
Shut the fuck up.

00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:40.525
Well, fucking here he is,
looks like Tarzan,

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.111
plays like fucking Jane.

00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:53.581
- Let's wake the arsehole up.
- Let's do it.

00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:57.125
Eh, eh, come on, up and at them.

00:22:57.126 --> 00:23:00.421
Up you get. There you go.
There's a good lad.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.052
- Who the hell are you guys?
- Never mind who the fuck we are.

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:10.013
Who the fuck are you
and what's in the fucking case?

00:23:10.014 --> 00:23:12.224
- You have no idea.
- No idea about what?

00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:13.851
I'm gonna die.

00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:16.354
You're gonna die.

00:23:17.063 --> 00:23:20.440
- You're gonna die. You're gonna die.
- We get it.

00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:22.193
Just kill me.

00:23:22.693 --> 00:23:24.278
What do we do now?

00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:26.072
Open your mouth.

00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:30.910
Give us the code with your fingers.

00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:49.220
Good boy.

00:23:52.265 --> 00:23:54.475
Why does it smell like permanent marker?

00:23:55.893 --> 00:23:59.396
Ah, is that PCP?

00:23:59.397 --> 00:24:01.774
Chuck.
Guys?

00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:04.277
Look at this.

00:24:10.992 --> 00:24:14.954
£2 million. Property of the Commission.

00:24:15.955 --> 00:24:19.041
- The Special Crimes Agency.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

00:24:19.709 --> 00:24:21.459
We've got to be rid of this cash.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.920
Wait, wait, let's not be
too fucking hasty, all right?

00:24:23.921 --> 00:24:25.839
- Ah, no.
- Oi.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.507
- It's been a long morning.
- Aye.

00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:30.552
We need to relax. We need to settle down.

00:24:30.553 --> 00:24:33.430
Get some fucking food,
think about this for an hour or two,

00:24:33.431 --> 00:24:35.849
- then decide what to do with the money.
- No.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.226
- Why?
- I should hold on to the case.

00:24:38.227 --> 00:24:41.104
- Why should you keep the case?
- I got the code.

00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:42.647
I've got the fucking code.

00:24:42.648 --> 00:24:46.359
If these spondulicks belong
to who this guy says they do,

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.612
we don't want anything
to do with them, hmm?

00:24:48.613 --> 00:24:50.280
- Hey, Siobhan.
- What?

00:24:50.281 --> 00:24:52.199
We're already in this.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:57.370
Look, we opened Pandora's Box,
we found 2 million quid in cash,

00:24:57.371 --> 00:24:59.206
we can't exactly fucking close it again,

00:24:59.207 --> 00:25:01.958
so if you didn't want to be involved,
you should have said so earlier.

00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:03.461
But I didn't.

00:25:04.045 --> 00:25:06.421
- Well, it sounded like you fucking did.
- I didn't.

00:25:06.422 --> 00:25:09.507
But here we are and we can't stay

00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:11.343
because if he's here,
there's more on the way.

00:25:11.344 --> 00:25:13.303
- Agreed.
- Well, what are we gonna do?

00:25:13.304 --> 00:25:16.640
Well, I do... Eh, we'll go to your place.

00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:19.893
- And the hostage?
- Bringing him with us.

00:25:19.894 --> 00:25:22.730
Ah, Siobhan?
Huh?

00:25:23.648 --> 00:25:27.525
How the fuck do we get him
and a suitcase with 2 million cash

00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:29.487
out of this house
without anyone seeing us?

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:50.006
What the hell do you mean,
the shipment was late?

00:25:50.007 --> 00:25:54.302
It's your job to make sure
everything is on time.

00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:55.429
You know? Is...

00:25:56.305 --> 00:25:58.307
Deal with it, eh, yeah?

00:26:00.685 --> 00:26:02.352
Good morning, Mr. Barrett.

00:26:02.353 --> 00:26:04.980
- Why the hell are you here so early?
- Well, I...

00:26:04.981 --> 00:26:08.441
Don't... Don't talk to me
with your hand like that. It's just weird.

00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:09.985
Oh. Should we?

00:26:09.986 --> 00:26:12.613
Yeah, we should.

00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:15.782
- We never received our payment last night.
- What do you mean?

00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:18.368
The money, it never made it
to the dead-drop site.

00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:19.704
That's impossible.

00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:21.330
I wouldn't make this up.

00:26:22.164 --> 00:26:23.499
Sure, you would.

00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:25.333
What's your plan?

00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:27.753
Push me around a little for the big man?

00:26:28.462 --> 00:26:30.463
Get some more money out of me?

00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:32.090
Set me up and take me down?

00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.300
I assure you that...

00:26:33.301 --> 00:26:35.760
"He who seeks to deceive..."

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:38.013
"Will always find someone
who is willing to be deceived."

00:26:38.014 --> 00:26:39.514
Yes, I... I know the quote.

00:26:39.515 --> 00:26:44.227
Well, well, then you must know
I wouldn't allow myself to be deceived.

00:26:44.228 --> 00:26:47.982
I assure you, the money never made it.

00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:51.360
Or you want the money for yourself.

00:26:52.695 --> 00:26:54.030
A double bribe?

00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:57.700
I see you are alone today.

00:26:59.285 --> 00:27:01.202
Officer James is taking care
of other things.

00:27:01.203 --> 00:27:03.164
Of course, he is.

00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:09.252
So, say this is what it seems
and the money didn't make it,

00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:10.754
what then?

00:27:10.755 --> 00:27:13.006
When the money didn't make it,
we went to the safe house.

00:27:13.007 --> 00:27:14.758
Oh, well, how do you know?

00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:16.927
We are the SCA, Mr. Barrett.

00:27:18.763 --> 00:27:21.931
Yes, you are. Yes, you are! I'm so sorry.

00:27:21.932 --> 00:27:23.684
Pew.

00:27:28.189 --> 00:27:29.939
We went to the safe house

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.026
and found a bio hazard clean-up crew.

00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:39.241
Those are the last people
who were in this house.

00:27:39.742 --> 00:27:41.451
Now, given this is your safe house,

00:27:41.452 --> 00:27:45.413
we fully plan on inserting
ourselves into this situation.

00:27:45.414 --> 00:27:48.541
Should we do so, you can safely assume
we will be doing our jobs

00:27:48.542 --> 00:27:51.253
and cannot guarantee the safety
of your organization.

00:27:52.338 --> 00:27:54.214
Rob!
Yeah.

00:27:54.215 --> 00:27:55.883
Get your ass up here!

00:27:56.467 --> 00:27:57.467
Sorry.

00:27:57.885 --> 00:27:59.219
- Mr. Barrett.
- Yeah.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.679
We will be here in three days
with a warrant.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.641
We will serve it
unless you have the money.

00:28:04.392 --> 00:28:05.976
Not.

00:28:11.023 --> 00:28:12.316
Move it, Mary.

00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:18.780
Rob, do you know
the safe house on Peyton?

00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:19.698
Yeah, sure.

00:28:19.699 --> 00:28:23.118
Danny and Jack were in charge
of it, right?

00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:24.327
- That's right, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:26.330
Now, have you heard from them?

00:28:27.081 --> 00:28:29.541
- Uh, come to think of it, no.
- No.

00:28:29.542 --> 00:28:31.460
Are those dimwits fucking dead?

00:28:32.628 --> 00:28:34.963
I'm guessing one of them is.

00:28:34.964 --> 00:28:38.925
Now the other is in there.

00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:44.180
- I get it. You want him alive.
- Do I give a shit about him?

00:28:44.181 --> 00:28:46.683
- Eh, fuck no.
- No. Yeah, not really.

00:28:46.684 --> 00:28:51.729
Now, I need my money
as soon as fucking possible.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.898
One hundred thousand fucking percent.

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:54.899
I'll go get it.

00:28:59.363 --> 00:29:00.781
Go to the basement.

00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:09.373
He's still breathing. Let's get him out.

00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:24.054
Oh, my fucking days.

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:32.020
Fucking hell, Charlie,
how hard did you hit him?

00:29:32.021 --> 00:29:33.189
Hmm.

00:29:34.356 --> 00:29:36.066
Come on, give me a hand.

00:29:38.027 --> 00:29:39.403
Up you come.

00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:45.284
Oh, fuck. Let me take a look at you.

00:29:47.453 --> 00:29:48.662
He's all right.

00:29:50.498 --> 00:29:52.541
Alex, can we talk inside?

00:29:53.542 --> 00:29:54.542
Yeah.

00:29:56.045 --> 00:29:57.046
Watch him.

00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:11.894
Not yet, not yet.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.479
What now?

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.022
I think I should be the one
to hold on to the case.

00:30:16.023 --> 00:30:17.565
- Why not me?
- What?

00:30:17.566 --> 00:30:20.235
I mean, I agree. I think it should be you
that holds on to the case,

00:30:20.236 --> 00:30:23.029
but I'm a little offended
that you don't think it should be me.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.366
What are you
talking about? We live together.

00:30:26.283 --> 00:30:28.826
Never mind.
I just don't trust them, Alex.

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:31.746
I don't trust anybody, but you and myself.

00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:33.540
What's the worst-case scenario here?

00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:35.708
The bad guys show up and kill us?

00:30:35.709 --> 00:30:38.503
With the money, Meagan, with the money.

00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:40.255
I don't know, I mean,

00:30:40.256 --> 00:30:44.133
Charlie would blow it all on drugs
and Siobhan doesn't want the money.

00:30:44.134 --> 00:30:46.678
She'd just turn the money over
and be done with it.

00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:48.680
She can't go to the police.

00:30:48.681 --> 00:30:51.516
We have a hostage that she helped to take.

00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:53.059
Not to the police, to the Commission.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.895
I don't trust her, Alex.

00:30:55.729 --> 00:30:56.897
What's the deal?

00:30:57.565 --> 00:30:59.148
She doesn't trust you.

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:00.568
She doesn't trust me?

00:31:01.235 --> 00:31:03.278
Did I just hallucinate that
or are you asking me that?

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:04.988
No, no, no, no, no.

00:31:04.989 --> 00:31:07.950
Now to clarify, is she taking the case?

00:31:08.659 --> 00:31:10.077
Yeah, she wants to.

00:31:10.744 --> 00:31:11.786
Fuck.

00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:14.665
You have got to stop smoking that shite.

00:31:22.089 --> 00:31:24.674
Give the poor lass a job,
find her a boyfriend,

00:31:24.675 --> 00:31:25.758
doesn't trust me.

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:27.261
Doesn't trust me!

00:31:28.304 --> 00:31:30.096
What the fuck?

00:31:30.097 --> 00:31:33.558
How could she not trust me,
for Christ's sake?

00:31:33.559 --> 00:31:34.559
Where's the other one?

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.853
I know I've got another one
in here somewhere.

00:31:36.854 --> 00:31:38.272
Oh, there we go.

00:31:38.772 --> 00:31:41.566
That fucking money,
I knew it'd be trouble.

00:31:41.567 --> 00:31:42.901
All right then.

00:31:49.992 --> 00:31:50.992
Why not?

00:31:51.994 --> 00:31:54.203
I can't risk anything happening
to this money.

00:31:54.204 --> 00:31:56.873
We could get married,
open our funeral home.

00:31:56.874 --> 00:31:57.833
You know what?

00:31:57.834 --> 00:32:00.126
I never agreed to open a funeral home.

00:32:00.127 --> 00:32:02.755
- You did.
- I don't think so.

00:32:04.048 --> 00:32:08.093
But I do agree that
you should hold on to the case.

00:32:08.969 --> 00:32:10.928
I'll tell everyone. All right?

00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:13.431
- All right.
- Good.

00:32:13.432 --> 00:32:16.351
All right, I've made a decision.
I've already figured it out.

00:32:16.352 --> 00:32:19.937
I've got two sets of keys,
one for Alex and one for myself.

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:22.148
Until we decide what to do with the money,

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:23.608
it'll remain locked up.

00:32:23.609 --> 00:32:26.486
Chuck and I are taking off to get
some sleep and see my little fuckers.

00:32:26.487 --> 00:32:28.530
Don't forget to feed the hostage.

00:32:29.782 --> 00:32:30.782
Chuck!

00:32:35.663 --> 00:32:38.874
What? I'm gonna go feed the hostage.

00:32:44.922 --> 00:32:46.423
We got company.

00:32:49.718 --> 00:32:50.885
What now?

00:32:50.886 --> 00:32:52.887
I need that money.

00:32:52.888 --> 00:32:55.932
I want you to understand.
That's blood money.

00:32:55.933 --> 00:32:59.686
That money changes everything.
For all of us.

00:32:59.687 --> 00:33:01.896
But at what cost? Hmm?

00:33:01.897 --> 00:33:03.856
Look at the way we're turning
against each other.

00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:05.942
We aren't turning against each other.

00:33:05.943 --> 00:33:09.279
We all wanna be rich
and you want to be a pain in the ass.

00:33:13.075 --> 00:33:15.411
You have a bit of growing up to do.

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:48.235
What, Rob?

00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:52.989
I apologize, Officer James.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.826
I... I thought you were someone else, yeah.

00:33:56.577 --> 00:33:57.745
I understand.

00:33:58.328 --> 00:33:59.788
I'm working on it.

00:34:01.248 --> 00:34:03.708
Right. Well, have a lovely day.

00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:05.210
Yeah, bye.

00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:18.556
Yeah, boss!
Rob, you asshole.

00:34:18.557 --> 00:34:20.601
Have you made any progress?

00:34:23.437 --> 00:34:26.272
- Yeah, yeah, plenty. Plenty.
- Oh, yeah?

00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:28.233
It sounds like you're eating
fucking chips again.

00:34:29.693 --> 00:34:32.487
- You don't know what I'm fucking eating.
- It's all you ever eat!

00:34:32.488 --> 00:34:36.574
Oh, no, no, I eat other foods.
And chips are a vegetable. It's true.

00:34:36.575 --> 00:34:39.243
What do you... Listen,
what progress have you made?

00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:41.788
Well...

00:34:41.789 --> 00:34:45.833
They're at a house.
Looking right at the fuckers.

00:34:45.834 --> 00:34:50.963
And our inside guy with the police
says Danny is still alive.

00:34:50.964 --> 00:34:54.425
And I figure if Danny's there,
then the case is there, too.

00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:58.721
Well, all right. Listen.
There's been a change of plans, all right?

00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:00.973
I need the case tonight.

00:35:00.974 --> 00:35:02.225
What about the cleaners?

00:35:02.226 --> 00:35:06.688
Well, if anybody survives,
I will kill your entire family.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:11.944
- Well, I wouldn't blame you.
- Yeah, good. Bye.

00:35:15.948 --> 00:35:17.199
I don't know.

00:35:18.158 --> 00:35:19.909
But you agree she was mad at me.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.329
Well, to be honest,
everyone seems mad.

00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:27.625
Yeah, but she was mad at me.

00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:28.710
I don't know.

00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:32.088
- And guess what.
- What?

00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:35.884
It doesn't matter,
because we're all gonna die.

00:35:37.678 --> 00:35:39.221
And I'm thirsty.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:59.074
Open.

00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:06.748
I got something to tell you.

00:36:08.667 --> 00:36:09.917
What?

00:36:09.918 --> 00:36:11.545
You're a shite boxer.

00:36:14.381 --> 00:36:17.175
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

00:36:20.762 --> 00:36:22.806
What are you doing?
Seriously?

00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:25.350
What?

00:36:33.317 --> 00:36:34.484
Let me start.

00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:37.613
I'm confused.

00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:41.116
I'm sorry. Well...

00:36:41.992 --> 00:36:43.951
Do you even know what you're sorry for?

00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:46.329
For not standing up
for you against Siobhan.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.664
- For not having your back.
- Right.

00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:50.541
So what are you confused about?

00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:52.835
But I did stand up
for you against Siobhan.

00:36:52.836 --> 00:36:56.798
And I did have your back.
I fought for more than you did.

00:36:57.591 --> 00:36:59.383
Why is it up to me
to speak up all the time?

00:36:59.384 --> 00:37:00.968
She gave you the key.

00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:03.638
Meagan, it's like giving us the key.

00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:04.598
You want the truth?

00:37:04.599 --> 00:37:06.933
- Yeah, I want the fucking truth.
- I was going to steal it.

00:37:06.934 --> 00:37:08.393
- Why the fuck...
- Let me finish!

00:37:09.102 --> 00:37:10.603
I wanted us to take it and run.

00:37:10.604 --> 00:37:13.272
That much money would completely
jump-start our lives together.

00:37:13.273 --> 00:37:14.815
Siobhan doesn't want the money,

00:37:14.816 --> 00:37:16.901
and it's in Charlie's better interest
not to have it.

00:37:16.902 --> 00:37:18.611
That money should have been ours.

00:37:18.612 --> 00:37:21.281
But how does that make you mad at me?

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:25.327
It's just the principle of the matter.

00:37:25.994 --> 00:37:27.329
The fucking principle?

00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:33.961
The fucking principle?

00:37:42.803 --> 00:37:43.803
I can't win here, can I?

00:37:43.804 --> 00:37:45.472
- Nope.
- Fuck.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:49.350
All right.

00:37:56.733 --> 00:37:57.734
All right then.

00:37:58.902 --> 00:37:59.902
I'm in.

00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:03.615
- What?
- I said I'm in.

00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:06.158
Let's steal the money.

00:38:06.159 --> 00:38:08.536
I have fucking bolt cutters, Meagan.

00:38:08.537 --> 00:38:11.777
The handcuffs, the keys, they don't mean
anything. I'll cut his fucking hands off.

00:38:12.833 --> 00:38:15.377
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

00:38:16.545 --> 00:38:19.297
Look, all I want is you.

00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:24.468
I'm gonna go throw some clothes
in a suitcase for me and for you,

00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:27.054
and then we're gonna take
the fucking money and run.

00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:28.181
All right.

00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:53.582
Shh.

00:38:59.087 --> 00:39:00.464
What the fuck is that?

00:39:02.382 --> 00:39:03.633
Stay here.

00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:22.736
Fuck.

00:39:30.786 --> 00:39:32.579
Oh, fucking hell.

00:39:36.249 --> 00:39:37.249
Meg?

00:39:38.794 --> 00:39:41.713
Meg!

00:39:52.307 --> 00:39:53.391
Meg?

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.560
Meg!

00:39:57.896 --> 00:39:58.980
Meagan!

00:40:03.777 --> 00:40:05.611
Fuck me. I thought you were dead.

00:40:05.612 --> 00:40:08.447
I thought I was gonna die.
I thought we were all gonna die!

00:40:08.448 --> 00:40:11.034
Where's Meagan? Meagan!

00:40:11.952 --> 00:40:12.952
Meagan!

00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:51.658
Fuck!

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.086
How the fuck is this my fault?

00:41:04.087 --> 00:41:06.630
First of all,
don't raise your voice to me.

00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:10.593
Second of all, who was it convinced us
to take the money in the first place?

00:41:10.594 --> 00:41:13.262
Ding, dang, dong, you did, motherfucker.

00:41:13.263 --> 00:41:15.556
Okay, so this is my fault,

00:41:15.557 --> 00:41:17.266
but it's not about me or the money.

00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:19.727
Meagan's life is in danger.

00:41:19.728 --> 00:41:23.814
She may be dead already, and you two
don't seem to be fazed at all!

00:41:23.815 --> 00:41:25.900
If you only understood
the shite we've seen.

00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:29.738
- Fuck off.
- Al, just call the police.

00:41:31.031 --> 00:41:33.115
- No cops.
- Do you know what?

00:41:33.116 --> 00:41:35.702
For the first time
in his fucking life, he's right.

00:41:36.453 --> 00:41:37.912
No police.

00:41:37.913 --> 00:41:39.288
It's too late for that, Siobhan.

00:41:39.289 --> 00:41:42.167
And remember, you broke
the fucking law as well.

00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:45.921
Now, look at me.

00:41:47.797 --> 00:41:49.090
I need your help.

00:41:49.758 --> 00:41:52.927
Not as a boss, but as a friend.

00:41:52.928 --> 00:41:54.971
I'm not your fucking friend.

00:41:59.351 --> 00:42:03.187
- You two brought this on yourselves.
- How the fuck did I bring it on myself?

00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:05.397
You called me at 7:30
this morning, remember?

00:42:05.398 --> 00:42:07.776
To go to work.
And look at where it's gotten me.

00:42:09.486 --> 00:42:11.445
What about you, Charlie, huh?

00:42:11.446 --> 00:42:12.864
We're friends.

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:16.158
I'll buy you drugs. You can have my share.

00:42:16.159 --> 00:42:18.662
You can have fucking Siobhan's share.
She doesn't want it.

00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:22.539
- What does helping you involve?
- Fuck me.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:26.252
We find out who the money
belongs to, we go there,

00:42:26.253 --> 00:42:30.757
we kill them, we come back here,
nothing more, nothing less.

00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:33.217
1.5?

00:42:33.218 --> 00:42:34.886
1.5.

00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:38.806
- One mil, Chuck. I'm back in.
- Are you?

00:42:38.807 --> 00:42:42.936
- Chuck's going, I'm going.
- All right. All right.

00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:45.312
This is what I wanted to hear.

00:42:45.313 --> 00:42:47.773
So, what's the plan?

00:42:47.774 --> 00:42:49.817
- Pack your shite.
- That guy and the money

00:42:49.818 --> 00:42:51.318
- still in the basement?
- Yeah.

00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:54.239
Alex, you take a different car.
We need a clean exit.

00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:57.534
- I'll go get our little friend.
- Good.

00:43:02.539 --> 00:43:04.540
Chuck Leavenworth has his problems,

00:43:04.541 --> 00:43:05.750
but he's loyal.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.169
He'll die for this.

00:43:08.795 --> 00:43:11.423
I just hope you can hold that
on your conscience.

00:43:12.173 --> 00:43:14.843
- I can.
- If you say so.

00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:18.930
I do say so.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.945
I'll kill him.

00:43:36.031 --> 00:43:37.407
Please, please.

00:43:38.491 --> 00:43:40.409
- Hi.
- Sit on the fucking couch.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:42.828
It's about damn time, right?
Well, we have a problem.

00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:44.747
Yeah, no shit,
who the fuck is she?

00:43:44.748 --> 00:43:48.043
Ah, she's one of the cleaners.
Uhhuh, come here.

00:43:49.377 --> 00:43:54.089
Why did you bring me a girl
and not a briefcase full of money?

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.759
Because it wasn't fucking there.

00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:57.676
Cleaners must have taken it

00:43:57.677 --> 00:44:00.763
and now she is our fucking leverage.

00:44:00.764 --> 00:44:03.307
Who... Who... Who are these people?

00:44:03.308 --> 00:44:04.601
Well, I don't know.

00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:09.272
What do you know about me, Rob?

00:44:10.065 --> 00:44:10.982
Me.

00:44:10.983 --> 00:44:13.650
- Um, you're the boss.
- Yeah.

00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:15.361
You quote Machiavelli
way too fucking much.

00:44:15.362 --> 00:44:16.321
- Yeah.
- And...

00:44:16.322 --> 00:44:20.199
Wait. No, stop, stop, stop.
Just repeat the first one.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.283
You're the boss.

00:44:21.284 --> 00:44:26.872
Yeah, not just a boss, Rob.
I am that boss.

00:44:26.873 --> 00:44:27.832
Okay.

00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:31.668
Any other organization
can get hunted and taken down.

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:33.712
- Right.
- You know the Five Families?

00:44:33.713 --> 00:44:34.880
Hunted.

00:44:34.881 --> 00:44:37.549
The cartels? Thriving, but hunted.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:39.301
Me? Us?

00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:40.512
The Commission?

00:44:41.304 --> 00:44:42.888
But not us, right?

00:44:42.889 --> 00:44:44.932
- Right.
- But do you know why? Do you know why?

00:44:44.933 --> 00:44:47.726
- Well, you're gonna tell me, aren't you?
- Yeah.

00:44:47.727 --> 00:44:53.691
Because for seven years I've been paying
off corrupt officers just to keep us safe.

00:44:55.068 --> 00:45:00.155
Bribery is one of
the oldest traditions in the world.

00:45:00.156 --> 00:45:02.950
And nobody does it better than me!
Excuse me.

00:45:02.951 --> 00:45:06.662
Now, if you don't get that money for me,

00:45:06.663 --> 00:45:09.039
where does that leave us?

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.499
Well...

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.919
No, no, that... that was rhetorical. No.

00:45:13.628 --> 00:45:16.296
It leaves us ruined.

00:45:16.297 --> 00:45:20.509
Rob, I don't want to kill you.
Rob, I like you.

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.264
- Ah, no, and I like you too.
- Yeah, well, but if you don't have it,

00:45:25.098 --> 00:45:26.598
I don't have a choice, man.

00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:28.684
I'll get the fucking...
I'll get the fucking money!

00:45:28.685 --> 00:45:30.894
Yeah, here you go.
I'll get it!

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:33.064
- Going to get it now.
- Yeah.

00:45:37.152 --> 00:45:38.361
I'm going to fucking kill him.

00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:54.209
Hey, Siobhan, I thought
Charlie lived in the van?

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:57.671
He does. Built this for emergencies.

00:45:57.672 --> 00:46:00.883
Well, he's really hiding his fucking
American roots, isn't he?

00:46:00.884 --> 00:46:02.719
It's like a fucking psychopath's
Disneyland.

00:46:13.563 --> 00:46:16.483
All right, in... in you go. Go on!

00:46:19.194 --> 00:46:20.403
Chain him up.

00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:25.074
Sit down there, mate.

00:46:32.373 --> 00:46:34.834
Here. I'm sorry, mate.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.003
It is what it is.

00:46:37.712 --> 00:46:40.089
Yeah, it is...

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.927
what it is.

00:46:47.764 --> 00:46:49.014
Are you comfortable?

00:46:49.015 --> 00:46:50.391
Yeah.
Good.

00:47:00.193 --> 00:47:02.904
Siobhan? Charlie? Shiv...

00:47:05.156 --> 00:47:06.282
Charlie.

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:09.993
Who you hiding from?

00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:11.371
God.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.039
Oh, fuck.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.376
Chuck, not now, not ever.

00:47:17.585 --> 00:47:20.046
'Cause you know what? Here, Charlie.

00:47:21.297 --> 00:47:26.176
Sober Charlie can put
whole sentences together.

00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:31.808
Hmm. But "off his fucking nut
on PCP" Charlie, not so much.

00:47:32.392 --> 00:47:34.560
It's always fucking snowing
and you're always

00:47:34.561 --> 00:47:37.938
on the ground fucking naked
doing blood angels.

00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:39.565
And what's the fucking crack?

00:47:39.566 --> 00:47:43.152
Especially for a proper
handsome fucker like you.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:46.781
Fine.

00:47:49.117 --> 00:47:50.076
Good.

00:47:50.077 --> 00:47:52.202
How about you go ask the wee man
some questions?

00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:54.455
Oh, f... shit.

00:47:55.248 --> 00:47:56.374
You're right.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.293
I'm getting rusty.

00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:00.420
Yeah, mate.

00:48:02.338 --> 00:48:03.631
He'll manage.

00:48:10.305 --> 00:48:12.806
- Peek-a-boo.
- Oh, not this guy again.

00:48:12.807 --> 00:48:15.392
I was coming down
when we tied this dickhead up.

00:48:15.393 --> 00:48:16.728
You ever search him?

00:48:18.605 --> 00:48:21.356
No.
Amateur hour.

00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:22.900
Come here.

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:26.613
Just tell me what you need.
You don't need to be so aggressive.

00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:35.829
I'm going up the chain.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.081
- Who's your head honcho?
- I don't know.

00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:40.084
- Yes, you do.
- I don't.

00:48:40.752 --> 00:48:43.253
The Commission has
a complex power structure.

00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:46.089
Each member only knows
a handful of others.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.718
Finding him would be like following
a trail of breadcrumbs.

00:48:49.719 --> 00:48:52.221
Somewhere in this phone
is the name of your boss.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.267
Ah, I'd love to beat it out of you.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.103
He would love to beat it out of you.

00:49:01.147 --> 00:49:02.397
Or I could just tell you.

00:49:02.398 --> 00:49:04.901
Just tell me the name, not what to say.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:08.779
- Diarmuid.
- There you go.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.991
- You can work your way up from there.
- Attaboy.

00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:21.918
Yeah?

00:49:22.877 --> 00:49:23.920
Lovely.

00:49:24.629 --> 00:49:26.047
Siobhan?

00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:30.468
Yeah, well, what he said.

00:49:34.597 --> 00:49:36.306
You're welcome.

00:49:36.307 --> 00:49:38.392
We got a location.

00:49:38.393 --> 00:49:40.519
These assholes only know
a few members at a time,

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.938
so we gotta go up the chain.

00:49:42.939 --> 00:49:46.233
I figured you'd get something off of him,
so I packed us a goodie bag.

00:49:46.234 --> 00:49:48.443
Ooh.

00:49:48.444 --> 00:49:51.656
- Uh, no, wait. Oh. Oh.
- Uh...

00:49:52.365 --> 00:49:54.283
Look at this fucking sword.

00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:58.370
- Ah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Alex.

00:49:58.371 --> 00:50:00.039
- Yeah?
- She's mine.

00:50:01.124 --> 00:50:02.917
My lord.

00:50:04.377 --> 00:50:06.712
- It's a girl.
- Oh, he's even got a name for her.

00:50:06.713 --> 00:50:08.171
Alex?
Yeah.

00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:10.716
We're gonna have to take your car.
They'll recognize the van.

00:50:10.717 --> 00:50:12.175
Yeah.
Righty-o.

00:50:12.176 --> 00:50:15.011
- All right.
- Uh, sorry, chaps.

00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:16.805
Oh.
Um, minor problem.

00:50:16.806 --> 00:50:18.015
- Um...
- Oh, no.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:22.019
My car only fits two people.

00:50:22.729 --> 00:50:24.896
Mmm. Yeah.

00:50:24.897 --> 00:50:26.649
- Well, I can...
- Sorry.

00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:49.255
Charlie...

00:50:50.882 --> 00:50:53.342
- I left the keys in the house.
- Mm.

00:50:55.428 --> 00:50:57.012
Well, go fucking get 'em.

00:50:57.013 --> 00:50:58.180
- Run.
- Yeah, all right.

00:50:58.181 --> 00:51:00.266
- Let's go!
- You stay there, yeah?

00:51:01.184 --> 00:51:02.184
Get the keys!

00:51:03.811 --> 00:51:05.646
I'm gonna fucking die today.

00:51:10.985 --> 00:51:13.070
We're going up the chain. Who's your boss?

00:51:13.905 --> 00:51:15.698
Nothing? Dip him.

00:51:19.744 --> 00:51:22.245
- Good?
- There you go.

00:51:22.246 --> 00:51:25.499
I don't give a shit
if you're dead or alive.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.918
- Who's your boss?
- O'Connor.

00:51:27.919 --> 00:51:31.421
- Reggie fucking O'Connor.
- Now that wasn't that hard, now was it?

00:51:31.422 --> 00:51:32.422
We good?

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.425
Good boy.

00:51:40.348 --> 00:51:44.185
Wait! What the fuck are you doing? Stop!

00:51:54.695 --> 00:51:55.695
Night-night.

00:51:57.782 --> 00:51:59.032
- He's fucking dead.
- Yeah.

00:51:59.033 --> 00:52:00.117
You killed him.

00:52:00.993 --> 00:52:02.536
You never seen a dead man before?

00:52:02.537 --> 00:52:04.496
Not one that I fucking killed, no.

00:52:04.497 --> 00:52:07.291
- Well, you didn't kill this one either.
- Oh, fuck.

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:12.129
- Charlie, can I ask you a question, mate?
- Huh?

00:52:13.005 --> 00:52:14.798
What did you do in the military?

00:52:14.799 --> 00:52:16.259
I wasn't in the military.

00:52:16.968 --> 00:52:21.264
But if you were in the military,
what would you have done?

00:52:23.224 --> 00:52:24.767
You ever see Zero Dark Thirty?

00:52:26.602 --> 00:52:28.436
Oh, the film, yeah, yeah.

00:52:28.437 --> 00:52:30.772
Yeah. Something like that.

00:52:30.773 --> 00:52:34.151
We are literally just
a crime scene clean-up crew.

00:52:34.902 --> 00:52:38.321
A crime scene clean-up crew,

00:52:38.322 --> 00:52:42.284
are they life-long cleaners, or what?

00:52:42.285 --> 00:52:45.328
One of them wants to be an MMA fighter,

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:47.455
the other is a military vet

00:52:47.456 --> 00:52:51.251
and the other, well,
we don't know much about him.

00:52:51.252 --> 00:52:54.380
You don't know much about him?

00:52:56.007 --> 00:52:59.093
How long have you people been
working together?

00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:01.136
A year or so.

00:53:01.137 --> 00:53:05.265
A year? And... And you don't know
anything about him?

00:53:05.266 --> 00:53:09.811
Whatever happened
to getting to know people?

00:53:09.812 --> 00:53:10.980
Jesus.

00:53:11.772 --> 00:53:15.191
I worked as a janitor
for three days, you know,

00:53:15.192 --> 00:53:18.529
and I knew my coworkers'
favorite Christmas dish.

00:53:19.864 --> 00:53:22.407
Janitor to criminal kingpin?

00:53:22.408 --> 00:53:23.783
What a success story.

00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:25.952
Well, yeah, I am the fucking man.

00:53:25.953 --> 00:53:27.495
Boss?

00:53:27.496 --> 00:53:29.248
Yeah!
Oh.

00:53:30.041 --> 00:53:32.376
We have an issue.

00:53:33.502 --> 00:53:37.465
Are you drinking fucking tea?
What are... Tea!

00:53:38.674 --> 00:53:40.508
Yeah. I'm... I'm drinking tea.

00:53:40.509 --> 00:53:42.928
Is that your fucking issue! Drinking tea?

00:53:42.929 --> 00:53:44.596
No, no, no, no, no.

00:53:44.597 --> 00:53:48.809
O'Connor got a really
weird text from Diarmuid...

00:53:49.393 --> 00:53:51.061
Spit everything out.

00:53:51.062 --> 00:53:54.105
- I have lost my patience with you.
- All right, all right, all right!

00:53:54.106 --> 00:53:58.736
We went to check on him
and he was floating in his pool.

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.906
And?
He wanted to talk. You see?

00:54:02.907 --> 00:54:04.449
So we headed over to O'Connor's.

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:09.872
- Yeah. Who were his connections?
- Well, Danny and Jack.

00:54:10.915 --> 00:54:15.544
"The first method for estimating
the intelligence of a ruler

00:54:16.212 --> 00:54:20.256
is to look at the men he has around him."

00:54:20.257 --> 00:54:21.508
- Huh.
- Yeah.

00:54:21.509 --> 00:54:23.927
- Machiavelli.
- Machiavelli, yes.

00:54:23.928 --> 00:54:26.513
You are making me look like a fool.

00:54:26.514 --> 00:54:28.641
- Oh!
- Rob.

00:54:31.102 --> 00:54:34.187
I will get the fucking money.

00:54:34.188 --> 00:54:39.943
You better, because next time
this gun won't be empty.

00:54:39.944 --> 00:54:42.697
Oh, Jesus.

00:54:50.246 --> 00:54:51.622
I don't like this.

00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:56.210
Charlie, what the fuck are you doing?
Not now, man.

00:54:56.877 --> 00:54:58.671
Now's exactly the right time.

00:55:00.089 --> 00:55:02.883
Charlie, come on,
you've been doing so well.

00:55:03.551 --> 00:55:04.844
Oh, fuck.

00:55:06.137 --> 00:55:08.389
Things are about to get so much worse.

00:55:10.141 --> 00:55:11.183
Let's go.

00:55:12.226 --> 00:55:13.227
Worse?

00:55:23.946 --> 00:55:27.241
Wait, Charlie, why don't you like this?

00:55:30.453 --> 00:55:31.453
Go.

00:55:32.455 --> 00:55:34.707
What the fuck are you doing?
Go.

00:55:39.462 --> 00:55:40.755
Charlie, I don't...

00:55:47.053 --> 00:55:48.053
Knock.

00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:49.680
What?

00:55:50.723 --> 00:55:51.723
Knock.

00:55:52.767 --> 00:55:53.893
Fuck.

00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:10.493
This isn't ding-dong ditch.

00:56:11.077 --> 00:56:12.077
Knock.

00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:14.872
Fucking hell.

00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:17.832
Sometimes I really fucking
hate you, Charlie.

00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:19.543
Yeah, well, get in line.

00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:21.879
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

00:56:43.526 --> 00:56:46.028
Yeah, one more. One.

00:56:51.826 --> 00:56:53.202
Guess they're home.

00:56:58.374 --> 00:57:00.917
- Ooh.
- That's why you made me knock, you fucker.

00:57:00.918 --> 00:57:04.504
I had to see if somebody was home.

00:57:04.505 --> 00:57:05.840
You done good.

00:57:06.382 --> 00:57:08.342
You done good.
Hand over the case.

00:57:10.719 --> 00:57:13.389
Time to go to work.
Oh, you get to it.

00:57:44.753 --> 00:57:46.088
Oh.

00:57:50.843 --> 00:57:51.843
Come on.

00:57:53.095 --> 00:57:54.138
Come on.

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:09.570
I'll be taking this.

00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:14.783
What the fuck?

00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:20.456
What the fuck?!

00:58:23.876 --> 00:58:25.169
Bastards.

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:32.885
- How you feeling, buddy?
- Oh.

00:58:33.594 --> 00:58:35.678
All my fucking ribs are broken.

00:58:35.679 --> 00:58:37.263
Yeah, you'll survive.

00:58:37.264 --> 00:58:38.265
Who's that?

00:58:44.813 --> 00:58:47.608
I won't take down the Commission
with somebody who won't kill.

00:58:50.945 --> 00:58:52.111
I'll kill.

00:58:52.112 --> 00:58:53.155
Yeah.

00:58:53.948 --> 00:58:55.324
Think about the money.

00:58:57.117 --> 00:58:58.993
- Meagan.
- Yeah.

00:58:58.994 --> 00:59:00.912
That bastard has Meagan.

00:59:00.913 --> 00:59:02.831
Blow his fucking brains out.

00:59:03.916 --> 00:59:06.459
- I can't do it, Charlie.
- Yes, you can.

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.213
Point the fucking gun at him and kill him.

00:59:10.673 --> 00:59:11.714
Okay.

00:59:11.715 --> 00:59:14.218
- Put your finger on the trigger.
- Yeah.

00:59:15.094 --> 00:59:16.094
Breathe in.

00:59:19.056 --> 00:59:20.683
Pull it and it's over.

00:59:26.689 --> 00:59:28.274
I'll be waiting in the car.

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:53.674
Oh, Alex, what have you done?

01:00:17.323 --> 01:00:19.408
Excuse me.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:24.872
What?

01:00:24.873 --> 01:00:29.084
The cleaners, they killed O'Connor
and... and they escaped the fucking ambush.

01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:30.961
Fuck!

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:35.215
Fuck! Fuck!

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.940
- I'm fine. Yeah, I'm...
- I can tell.

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:54.026
Fine.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:07.498
I take it things went well.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.545
- It all went great.
- Chuck?

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:16.256
Are you fucking high again?

01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:19.717
Sick of this shite.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:21.636
Yeah, cleaning up blood?

01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:22.554
Me too.

01:01:22.555 --> 01:01:26.058
No, what I'm sick of
is you throwing your life away.

01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:28.976
It helps me.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:33.022
We've both been down the same road.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:35.233
You've got to find a better way
to deal with it.

01:01:35.234 --> 01:01:36.360
I'm fine.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.572
How long are you planning
on living like this?

01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:43.699
I was thinking forever.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.161
Forever won't be long if you keep this up.

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:48.831
One can only hope.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:54.253
Hey, there's our killer.

01:01:55.504 --> 01:01:57.297
I just want all this to be over.

01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:01.552
It will be, soon enough.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:05.389
Did you let him get high again?

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:08.349
Did I what?

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:11.769
I'm gonna see if I can get anything
more out of that wee leprechaun.

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.147
Where's his phone?

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:19.110
- I'm not his fucking sponsor.
- Oh, yes, you are.

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:22.113
Not, not, not, not, not times a thousand!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:23.781
Yes, yes, yes!

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:24.867
You all right, Charlie?

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.828
Yeah.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:33.750
Fuck.

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:44.761
All righty, son.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.764
Where are you from?

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.475
- Why do you care?
- I don't.

01:02:50.476 --> 01:02:52.268
- Do you have kids?
- No.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.436
Well, I do.

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:56.940
They suck, but I like keeping them alive.

01:02:58.233 --> 01:02:59.359
So tell me.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.528
Who's the most important contact
in this phone?

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.572
- I already gave it to the other guy.
- Mm-mm.

01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:07.493
You gave him a name, but not the name.

01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:12.122
There's a contact
for emergencies in here, always is.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:18.504
- It's labeled "Help."
- Ah, yes, there we go.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:22.174
- Clear my name, too.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:03:25.052 --> 01:03:26.803
Oh, it isn't Danny.

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:29.056
None of your fucking business.

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:33.018
But I do have a deal
to make with you and your boss.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.522
Ah. Where shall we meet?

01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:42.152
You'll be all right.
First one's always the hardest.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:52.954
Anything else?

01:03:52.955 --> 01:03:55.165
Eh, no, nothing more.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.167
I'm just headed out for a while.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:03:59.460
Where you going?

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.128
Oh, get something to eat.

01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:03.589
Oh, could you get me some medicine,
please, for my tummy?

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.216
Absolutely.

01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:07.135
- Chuck, vegan?
- Yeah.

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:31.285
You know, I still don't believe you.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:34.328
What difference would it make
if I lie to you?

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.163
We're still kicking your ass either way.

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:37.623
No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:40.210
Nobody's kicking my ass.

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:42.920
No.

01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:45.591
Then why do you care who they are?

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:52.305
Do you want to know
why you're still alive?

01:04:52.306 --> 01:04:53.390
Sure.

01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:57.269
Because I want you to be.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:01.106
That's the only... the only reason I need.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:05.485
I could kill you at any point
and it wouldn't change a thing.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:07.403
Yeah.

01:05:08.155 --> 01:05:11.365
But there is a bit of a thrill

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:15.953
knowing that maybe,
just... just maybe, you know,

01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:18.665
I could kill you in front of them.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.875
They care about you,

01:05:20.876 --> 01:05:26.547
so I'm going to use that
just to crush them in their final moment.

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:30.218
So, uh, don't talk back to me.

01:05:32.012 --> 01:05:35.056
Don't think that you have a chance
of making it out of this,

01:05:35.057 --> 01:05:40.771
because uh, one way
or the other, you'll die.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:47.694
But just for shits and giggles.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:53.908
Let's leave it up to God.

01:05:53.909 --> 01:05:55.242
I'm an atheist.

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:58.288
No better time than the present.

01:05:59.039 --> 01:06:01.333
- Last words?
- Fuck you.

01:06:17.516 --> 01:06:21.645
- Ah! Fuck!
- Grab a gun, Alex. Let's go, come on.

01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:42.873
Fucking hell.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:47.629
Oh, fuck!

01:06:48.797 --> 01:06:50.673
You can do this, Alex.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.843
You're fucking tough, you are!

01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:04.563
Duck.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.943
Charlie!

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.946
Ooh! Yeah!

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:16.825
Oh, shit. Danny!

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.119
The money!

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:24.124
Oh, fuck.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:27.210
Why?

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:36.136
Siobhan.

01:07:37.429 --> 01:07:38.805
She fucked us.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:43.559
Oh, shite. Chuck!

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.520
What... Oh, fuck.

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.273
Well, they found us.

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:51.777
So I see.

01:07:53.153 --> 01:07:55.489
Did they, uh, get the money?

01:07:56.823 --> 01:07:58.950
- It's gone.
- Oh.

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:02.036
Probably for best.

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:04.498
Well, we were in too deep
from the start.

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.335
Thought you might want these back.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.004
Did you also have
a set of keys for my pair?

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.172
Excuse me.

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:17.551
I'm just curious, seeing as
you're the one who sold us out.

01:08:17.552 --> 01:08:19.178
I sold no one out!

01:08:19.179 --> 01:08:22.098
I gave them back the money, end of story.

01:08:22.766 --> 01:08:24.309
- We can go home now.
- No.

01:08:25.477 --> 01:08:26.769
There's no going home now.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:29.815
We have to get Meagan
and our money back.

01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:32.900
Meagan is dead, Al.

01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:35.069
That's the way it always goes.

01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:38.532
The sooner you accept it,
the sooner you'll be able to move on.

01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:43.702
Did you tell them where we were?

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:46.373
Abso-fucking-lutely not!

01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:51.335
There must have been a tracker
on the wee idget's phone. I...

01:08:51.336 --> 01:08:53.671
You could have killed us both
with that stunt you pulled.

01:08:53.672 --> 01:08:56.215
Not a stunt, Chuck, no.

01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:58.050
It was for the best.
Go. Go, now.

01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:59.636
- That blood money...
- Fuck!

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.099
- Go. Go.
- Chuck?

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.645
- No, I thought I was doing... Chuck!
- Go! Now. Get the fuck out of here!

01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:12.190
- Wait.
- What?

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:16.444
Please, Chuck, you gotta...
You... You understand how...

01:09:19.865 --> 01:09:20.865
Go.

01:09:30.208 --> 01:09:31.293
Charlie?

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:33.545
Yeah.

01:09:35.088 --> 01:09:36.798
Do you think that Meagan's really dead?

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:39.383
No.

01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:44.764
And I'll help you find her.

01:09:45.974 --> 01:09:47.267
And the money.

01:09:49.686 --> 01:09:50.686
Really?

01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:54.274
I'm not gonna lie.

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:58.570
I think we're friends now.

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:03.866
I mean, I'm not gonna sleep
with you like Meagan does, but...

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:06.368
Oh, no. Of course not.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:07.913
I think we're friends.

01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:09.622
Yeah.

01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:12.834
- Yeah, we are friends.
- Yeah.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:14.710
Charlie?

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:19.883
As your friend, um, Siobhan is right.

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:25.138
You do have to give up drugs,
just... just saying.

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:26.889
Yeah.

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:33.563
- Charlie?
- Hmm?

01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:35.940
One more question.

01:10:35.941 --> 01:10:37.233
Sure, Alex.

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:44.407
Are you like... Are you a war criminal?

01:10:49.621 --> 01:10:50.956
Not officially.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.249
Shh.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.335
Oh, yeah.

01:10:55.961 --> 01:10:57.504
Shh.

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:05.762
Well...

01:11:06.346 --> 01:11:09.348
It looks like someone did their job, huh?

01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:13.519
Eh, and... and I counted it,
it's all there, every bit of it.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.272
Ow.
Yeah.

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:20.150
Yeah.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:22.111
How'd you find it?

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:26.156
Eh, the cleaners turned on each other.
Very good.

01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:29.702
- "A wise man does at once..."
- No.

01:11:29.703 --> 01:11:32.579
- "...what a fool does finally."
- No.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.664
Machiavelli.

01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:37.001
I almost got an erection there.

01:11:37.002 --> 01:11:41.672
- That's for you.
- I'm so glad I don't have to kill you.

01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:44.550
- Oh, me too. Me too.
- Yeah.

01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:49.138
Now give those officers a call
and let's finish this.

01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:50.180
- All right.
- Okay.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:52.182
Could I have just a taste of it?

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:55.352
Um, no, no, you can't.
Stupid question.

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:57.187
Well, yes, it is. But it's okay.

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:59.523
- I love you.
- Yeah, I love you too. Yeah.

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:02.401
I assume you're going to kill me now.
Okay.

01:12:02.402 --> 01:12:04.570
Mm, no.

01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:06.655
Because God wants me alive?

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:07.865
What?

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:12.119
No, I... I don't believe in God.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.164
- I just like to say it.
- Then why?

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:18.125
Well, they're still alive
and they still have to pay,

01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:22.254
so as long as they're out there, you live.

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:24.716
- Yay.
- Yay.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.608
Whoo!

01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:44.903
Get out of the fucking way!

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:00.125
Dialed is not available.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.962
At the tone, please record your message.

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:07.091
Oh, hey, Al, uh...

01:13:07.092 --> 01:13:10.761
I know I left you in a bad way
back there, almost got you killed.

01:13:10.762 --> 01:13:12.846
Now we're gonna be asking you
a few fucking questions

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:15.140
and you're gonna answer 'em,
'cause if you fucking don't...

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:16.767
You ever hear of waterboarding?

01:13:16.768 --> 01:13:20.020
But, um, sorta new at this friend shite

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:23.649
and I truly meant to keep you safe.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.734
I didn't want you to end up like Meagan,

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:30.323
not that I'm assuming she's dead,
I just, um...

Uh, you give me a call
when you have a second.

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:13.408
I'm deeply sorry
and I would like to work it out.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.000
- Open it up.
- Yeah.

01:14:26.421 --> 01:14:30.257
Don't bother, okay? I know who you are.
So, let's get down to it.

01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:32.176
You want the briefcase, right?

01:14:32.177 --> 01:14:33.344
- No.
- Yes.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:37.431
I want the girl they took
with the briefcase.

01:14:37.432 --> 01:14:39.267
Well, what are you gonna give me for it?

01:14:40.185 --> 01:14:43.395
- Well, what do you want?
- Well, money. You know, pay me off.

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:45.565
No, it's my money.

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:48.109
You... You have to give me something.

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:50.236
Do you know what?

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.487
- I'll give you something.
- Okay.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:55.157
How about I not give you
a fucking bullet in your fucking head?

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:57.534
How's about I not have
my friend fucking Charlie here

01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:58.911
burn your fucking eyes out

01:14:58.912 --> 01:15:00.954
before I throw petrol
all over your fucking face?

01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:02.164
Okay, okay, okay.

01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:04.709
Just promise me
you'll let me go then, yeah?

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:09.880
- Deal.
- Okay. His name is Gabriel Barrett.

01:15:09.881 --> 01:15:13.092
I don't know anything about the girl,
but he has the briefcase if you hurry.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:17.679
Okay, there's an empty warehouse
down at the docks. He's there.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.641
All right? All right. Now.

01:15:20.642 --> 01:15:23.061
Close it.
You going to let me go now?

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:26.396
We had a deal. I thought
you were gonna let me go.

01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:29.859
Well, that's what happens
when you take someone's girlfriend.

01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:47.209
Well, Charlie, in an ideal world,
we'd go right through 'em.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.752
There's just the two of us.

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:51.005
We lose the element
of surprise, we're done.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.007
Yeah, you're right.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.261
We need to find a way around back.

01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:58.012
Let's jog on.

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:03.475
Oi, Charlie, get a fucking wiggle on, son.

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:04.644
Shut up.

01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:15.029
Oi, fucker, those are mine.

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:19.993
Disrespectful cunt.

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:29.876
Hey, Charlie, let me go first, mate, yeah?

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:35.465
Look, I'm afraid of heights
and ladders and if I do fall,

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:38.719
I want something nice
and stupid to fall on, all right?

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.971
Good man.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:43.516
And careful with
that fucking sword, Lancelot.

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:13.212
All right.

01:17:14.589 --> 01:17:15.964
Heads, you call the wife.

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:17.967
Tails, you call the girlfriend.

01:17:18.885 --> 01:17:20.969
Heads.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:24.223
Fuck. Best two out of three.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:35.150
They're here.

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:41.991
I know. I heard.

01:18:02.053 --> 01:18:05.890
Hmm, looks like
we've got a welcoming party.

01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:20.154
I bet that fucking handsome cunt
in the suit's Gabriel.

01:18:22.073 --> 01:18:23.116
Right.

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:27.161
Here is your money as promised.

01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:35.336
I added a little extra
for the inconvenience.

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:40.133
- We are square, right?
- Wrong. We're not fucking square, Gabriel.

01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:43.511
You think a little extra's gonna make up
for the mess you made?

01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:48.349
I've got houses full of dead bodies
that needs to be covered up.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:52.477
Shootings in suburban neighborhoods,
for God's sake.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:55.355
But... But we had a situation, you know.

01:18:55.356 --> 01:18:58.024
You understand that.
Everybody understands that.

01:18:58.025 --> 01:19:00.861
Yeah, well, someone has got
to be held responsible.

01:19:00.862 --> 01:19:04.030
So, either you turn yourself in

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:06.451
or you give me
one of your top men as collateral.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.412
It's your choice.

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:12.540
You're going about this all wrong.

01:19:14.876 --> 01:19:15.877
Always have.

01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:21.465
"There is no avoiding war,
it can only be postponed

01:19:21.466 --> 01:19:23.508
to the advantage of others."

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:25.218
Yeah, that.

01:19:25.219 --> 01:19:27.513
Not Machia-fucking-velli again.

01:19:28.598 --> 01:19:30.099
Wait. What...

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:32.602
Whoa.

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:38.065
Whoa.

01:19:39.025 --> 01:19:42.695
Officer James had no understanding
of how this should work.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:44.779
I'll be taking over now.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.283
And we'll be upping the take
moving forward.

01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:55.624
"A man who's used to acting
in one way never changes.

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:59.544
He must come to ruin
when the times, in changing,

01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:02.422
no longer are in harmony
with his ways." Here we go.

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:04.717
Are you all right?

01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:07.219
What the fuck?

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:08.763
Oh, fuck me.

01:20:12.767 --> 01:20:15.853
Yeah, yeah. Come and get me
when this is over, huh?

01:20:17.188 --> 01:20:18.438
Shouldn't we call for backup?

01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:20.815
What is this?
It's a crime-scene cleaner.

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:23.236
- They're not dangerous.
- But...

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:30.243
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:38.333
"It is far safer to be feared than loved."

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:41.378
"It's far safer to be feared than loved."

01:20:41.379 --> 01:20:45.967
"It is far safer to be feared than loved."

01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.856
Shoot the one with
the fucking machine gun.

01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:06.195
Goddamn it.

01:21:08.406 --> 01:21:09.615
Bunch of fuckers!

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:16.955
Oi! Get up!
If you don't get off your fucking arse,

01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:20.126
I am gonna personally kick
your fucking head in.

01:21:23.296 --> 01:21:24.296
Shit!

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:33.054
I'm still alive.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:35.725
Yeah, of course you're fucking
still alive, you fucking idiot.

01:21:54.452 --> 01:21:56.954
Ah! Shit!

01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:02.543
Keep shooting. Keep shooting
at these motherfuckers.

01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:10.051
I'm reloading.

01:22:18.893 --> 01:22:22.480
Did you bring a sword
to a fucking gun fight?

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:30.696
Come on!

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:55.512
You kicked me in my fucking knee

01:22:55.513 --> 01:22:58.431
and then tried to kill me
with a fucking sword.

01:22:58.432 --> 01:22:59.642
Fucker.

01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:28.962
Why the hell are you here?

01:23:28.963 --> 01:23:31.340
- How the fuck did you find us?
- Chuck texted.

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:34.009
Meagan's alive. We'll find her.

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:38.514
You can punch me in the face once.
You earned it.

01:23:39.432 --> 01:23:42.475
I'm not gonna punch you in the face, no.

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:44.437
I'm gonna do something much worse.

01:23:45.104 --> 01:23:47.897
I'm gonna forgive you,
but I will hold it over you

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:49.399
for the rest of your fucking days.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.360
Sounds good to me. Where's Chuck?

01:23:57.283 --> 01:24:00.786
Well, that looks like it fucking hurt.

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:05.166
I should fucking boot-stomp you to death.

01:24:09.086 --> 01:24:10.337
But I won't.

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:12.882
This is much better.

01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:16.718
Gonna send your wee little jewels
up your throat, fucker.

01:24:16.719 --> 01:24:17.719
Ah!

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.805
How's it feel, man?

01:24:20.473 --> 01:24:24.893
Shh, God, close your eyes, sweetheart.

01:24:24.894 --> 01:24:27.897
It'll all be over. No, no, sweetheart.

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:30.232
Just close your eyes.

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:33.778
Shh.

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:36.739
Close your eyes.

01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:41.702
Ah! Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:52.505
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

01:24:53.631 --> 01:24:54.631
What is it?

01:24:56.926 --> 01:25:01.096
I just have one question,
professional to professional.

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:05.558
Who the fuck are you people?

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:07.394
We're the Good Life Cleaners.

01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:13.234
Hello, Charlie.

01:25:13.859 --> 01:25:15.568
How you doing, me ol' son?

01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:17.321
- Come on.
- Come on and get.

01:25:18.572 --> 01:25:20.448
Jesus.
Fucking heavy bastard.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:21.950
Good boy.

01:25:21.951 --> 01:25:23.326
It's good to see you guys.

01:25:23.327 --> 01:25:25.788
Just shut the fuck up. Where's the boss?

01:25:29.834 --> 01:25:31.209
He's upstairs.

01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:32.335
In that little room?

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:34.379
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, ideal.

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:36.548
- 'Cause I happened to bring this along.
- Ooh.

01:25:36.549 --> 01:25:38.550
I've been wanting
to try out this dumb grenade.

01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:40.302
Now that's my type of lady.

01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:43.848
Prick.

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:55.358
Shit, the money.

01:25:55.359 --> 01:25:57.360
Uh, I... I'll get it.

01:25:57.361 --> 01:25:58.988
You can handle him.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:00.905
Thanks, mate.

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:02.533
Don't, please.

01:26:03.117 --> 01:26:05.494
Sorry.

01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:07.453
- Up there?
- Yeah.

01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:09.372
- Can you handle that one?
- Yeah.

01:26:09.373 --> 01:26:10.374
Let's go.

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:19.550
Head's up!

01:26:25.598 --> 01:26:26.682
Fuck!

01:26:31.979 --> 01:26:33.564
Fuck me, you're alive.

01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:37.734
Come on, love. That's a girl. Hey.

01:26:37.735 --> 01:26:41.195
Anybody else in here alive,
we're blasting bodies to be sure.

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:42.364
I'm alive.

01:26:43.073 --> 01:26:44.867
I'm alive!

01:26:45.993 --> 01:26:49.288
Fuck. He's all yours.

01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:55.418
- Try any creepy shit on you, did he?
- No, thank God.

01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:58.254
- I'm glad you're alive.
- Did you think I was dead?

01:26:58.255 --> 01:27:00.341
Of course
I thought you were fucking dead.

01:27:04.011 --> 01:27:06.971
Get your fucking arse up
from behind that fucking desk.

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:08.306
Jog on.

01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:11.268
Put your hands above your fucking head.

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:16.773
So, you're fucking Gabriel, are you?

01:27:16.774 --> 01:27:18.399
- That's me.
- Huh.

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.069
What's your name, pal?

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:25.239
- First of all, I ain't your fucking pal.
- Hmm.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.534
And second of all, I've got a shotgun here

01:27:28.535 --> 01:27:31.038
to put a fucking hole in you
the size of Gibraltar.

01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:35.751
And number three, you took my girlfriend.

01:27:37.127 --> 01:27:38.587
My name is Alex.

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:42.424
You read Machiavelli, Alex?

01:27:43.342 --> 01:27:44.343
No.

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:46.803
I haven't read Machiavelli.

01:27:46.804 --> 01:27:49.764
Well, there is a quote in there.

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:51.391
- Go on.
- It says, uh,

01:27:51.392 --> 01:27:54.435
"Everyone sees what you appear to be.

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:58.190
Few experience what you really are."

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:20.421
Fuck.

01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.844
Alex, Alex.

01:28:27.845 --> 01:28:30.097
Well, you're proper fucked now, son.

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:27.071
Yeah. Why not?

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:37.371
It's done.

01:29:44.171 --> 01:29:45.463
I knew he had it in him.

01:29:45.464 --> 01:29:48.382
Hi, Meg. You all right?
I'm fine.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:49.884
- He didn't hurt you?
- No, I'm fine.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:52.011
Okay.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:53.555
Ah, you got that.

01:29:56.183 --> 01:29:58.518
Why have you got
your fucking arm around me? I'm fine.

01:29:58.519 --> 01:30:00.436
He's not comforting you, you idget.

01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:02.730
I got shot in the leg, you dick.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:04.233
Oh, of course, sorry.

01:30:06.235 --> 01:30:08.946
So, what's next?
Ah, we make a good team.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:13.074
I missed out the first time,
so I'd like to try it out.

01:30:13.075 --> 01:30:15.576
Come on, Chuck. You know what?

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:16.953
I'm quite good at killing people.

01:30:16.954 --> 01:30:18.704
Yeah, you're okay at killing people.

01:30:18.705 --> 01:30:20.748
Don't get ahead of yourself now.

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:22.835
We should get a bigger van, eh?
Yeah.

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.212
Oi, Siobhan.
Eh?

01:30:25.796 --> 01:30:28.173
What about your kids?
They're in the van.

01:30:28.924 --> 01:30:31.092
Fine.

01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:33.303
Absolutely. Come on. Let's go.

01:32:12.986 --> 01:32:13.986
Hello.

01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:15.906
Guys, are you there?

01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:18.200
Are you letting me go?

01:32:18.825 --> 01:32:21.328
I mean, we... we had a fucking deal.
