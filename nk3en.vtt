00:17.220 --> 00:18.260
<b>Oh, Father in Heaven...</b>

00:18.760 --> 00:21.770
<b>Please. Stop that demon!</b>

00:54.920 --> 00:56.720
<b>Nice piece of ass...</b>

02:49.580 --> 02:51.880
<b>It was a dull job.</b>

02:51.960 --> 02:54.630
<b>I couldn't even get hard
playing with those bastards.</b>

02:54.710 --> 02:57.630
<b>My "big asset" here is going to waste.</b>

02:57.880 --> 03:01.050
<b>So just let the others
handle it next time, eh?</b>

03:01.130 --> 03:02.760
<b>Master Yamaji.</b>

03:03.350 --> 03:07.100
<b>A sword is a weapon
with no will of its own.</b>

03:08.640 --> 03:10.140
<b>Okay, Boss!</b>

03:10.230 --> 03:14.310
<b>But take it from me,
your pick-up lines are outdated as hell.</b>

03:14.940 --> 03:19.070
<b>Wearing those ridiculous ninja scarves
and obeying some oath or code</b>

03:19.150 --> 03:21.490
<b>is just not our style.</b>

03:21.780 --> 03:23.030
<b>Unless maybe...</b>

03:23.110 --> 03:25.910
<b>you're still hung up
on an old flame or something?</b>

03:25.990 --> 03:29.200
<b>The exiles are no longer
considered ninjas.</b>

03:29.290 --> 03:32.120
<b>We treat them as hostile
the instant they desert the organization.</b>

03:32.830 --> 03:36.040
<b>And every single one of them
must be eliminated</b>

03:36.130 --> 03:39.010
<b>to prevent our existence
from ever coming to light.</b>

03:40.260 --> 03:44.640
<b>Well, I gotta say,
this is one tempting piece of ass.</b>

03:44.930 --> 03:45.970
<b>Higan.</b>

03:46.050 --> 03:50.430
<b>One of the most elite ninjas
in the history of Japan.</b>

03:50.520 --> 03:52.770
<b>He's mastered
countless fighting techniques,</b>

03:52.850 --> 03:55.230
<b>and is merciless when it comes
to eliminating his targets.</b>

03:55.310 --> 03:58.110
<b>Truly a ninja among ninjas.</b>

03:59.110 --> 04:01.110
<b>He's mine.</b>

04:01.530 --> 04:04.820
<b>We dealt him a confirmed fatal blow
once before.</b>

04:04.910 --> 04:07.620
<b>However, he still lives.</b>

04:07.700 --> 04:08.870
<b>Oh?</b>

04:08.950 --> 04:11.790
<b>He must have used his secret art.</b>

04:12.250 --> 04:14.830
<b>Secret art, eh?</b>

04:14.920 --> 04:20.300
<b>One of those special techniques
that only the old ninjas could use, right?</b>

04:20.550 --> 04:23.300
<b>We may not be able to
definitively eliminate him</b>

04:23.380 --> 04:26.180
<b>unless we uncover the nature
of his secret art.</b>

04:26.680 --> 04:29.930
<b>Thus preparations are being made
to that end as we speak.</b>

04:30.560 --> 04:33.480
<b>There's a quicker solution, ya know?</b>

04:34.310 --> 04:38.020
<b>He'll be clinging to my leg and begging
"please let me suck it!"</b>

04:38.110 --> 04:40.690
<b>after I go give him a severe ass-kicking.</b>

04:41.030 --> 04:42.490
<b>Oh, that's right!</b>

04:43.900 --> 04:46.070
<b>What about that other guy?</b>

04:46.660 --> 04:48.580
<b>The "Reaper"...</b>

04:50.580 --> 04:53.710
<b>Brandishing your sword
with no pride is just violence.</b>

04:54.370 --> 04:57.040
<b>I taught you that long ago.</b>

04:57.580 --> 04:58.920
<b>Remember, Zai?</b>

04:59.710 --> 05:01.590
<b>How many exiled ninjas...</b>

05:01.670 --> 05:05.260
<b>or rather, your former comrades
have you killed now?</b>

05:05.970 --> 05:08.760
<b>The organization
has been corrupted to its core.</b>

05:08.850 --> 05:12.890
<b>The only reason that you kill exiled ninja
is because you fear them.</b>

05:13.560 --> 05:17.560
<b>Since those of us left are true ninja
who maintain our pride.</b>

05:17.650 --> 05:19.190
<b>And if you need proof of that...</b>

05:19.560 --> 05:22.570
<b>just look at the fact
you failed to kill Higan.</b>

05:23.740 --> 05:27.110
<b>He proved that those of us
who retain our faith in the old ways</b>

05:27.200 --> 05:29.490
<b>shall not fall to the likes of you.</b>

05:29.570 --> 05:33.120
<b>Once the other exiled ninjas
get word of that,</b>

05:33.200 --> 05:35.500
<b>they will surely
stand against you as I have.</b>

05:35.790 --> 05:38.710
<b>Let me make it painfully clear to you...</b>

05:39.210 --> 05:41.170
<b>who taught you to wield the blade.</b>

05:48.890 --> 05:52.930
<b>Oh, young barn swallow
yearning for a nest it cannot reach,</b>

05:53.010 --> 05:56.430
<b>wretched is the crisp fall wind
for us both!</b>

06:03.940 --> 06:06.900
<b>It is impossible to defend against
a blade of wind!</b>

06:06.990 --> 06:10.030
<b>This is my secret art, Flying Swallow!</b>

06:17.210 --> 06:20.420
<b>You won't be able to evade my technique
a second time.</b>

06:21.920 --> 06:23.840
<b>Hold on, where is your blade?!</b>

06:34.600 --> 06:36.140
<b>Fine then.</b>

06:36.220 --> 06:40.020
<b>I shall go to the pits of Hell...
and then wait...</b>

06:40.270 --> 06:42.480
<b>for you to join me.</b>

06:45.030 --> 06:46.690
<b>It's probably the Reaper...</b>

06:46.780 --> 06:50.070
<b>who's itching to go
straight for Higan's head first.</b>

06:50.150 --> 06:54.990
<b>I have forbid him from engaging with Higan
in any sort of battle.</b>

06:55.080 --> 06:58.250
<b>So what, you're not gonna
let them fight at all?</b>

07:00.210 --> 07:02.670
<b>That's a load of bullcrap!</b>

07:03.040 --> 07:04.540
<b>Well, we found evidence</b>

07:04.630 --> 07:07.210
<b>that this place was being used
by the Chinese mafia</b>

07:07.300 --> 07:08.880
<b>to launder money for a while now.</b>

07:09.130 --> 07:12.550
<b>And the fight that broke out was just
a turf war between rival organizations.</b>

07:12.640 --> 07:15.180
<b>That's what our investigation concluded.</b>

07:15.260 --> 07:17.350
<b>Money laundering, my ass!</b>

07:17.430 --> 07:20.440
<b>They couldn't even manage to
wash a greasy pan in that dump!</b>

07:20.520 --> 07:22.310
<b>Just think of it this way.</b>

07:22.440 --> 07:25.730
<b>You're lucky you won't have to
eat the crappy food there anymore!</b>

07:25.820 --> 07:26.780
<b>Right?</b>

07:27.570 --> 07:30.780
<b>So, did the bigwigs
from above give you that line?</b>

07:34.950 --> 07:35.910
<b>Mike.</b>

07:46.590 --> 07:49.010
<b>Stay focused on your duties, Mike.</b>

07:49.260 --> 07:53.340
<b>I won't be able to help you if you keep
sticking your nose into things like this.</b>

07:53.430 --> 07:56.810
<b>And then we'll have to get that guy
you were meeting up with last night</b>

07:56.890 --> 07:57.970
<b>involved as well.</b>

07:58.520 --> 07:59.810
<b>Think carefully.</b>

08:00.100 --> 08:01.890
<b>You'd be giving up
a comfortable retirement</b>

08:01.980 --> 08:04.400
<b>where you laze about all day fishing
and drinking scotch whisky.</b>

08:06.270 --> 08:09.780
<b>I actually prefer Japanese sake
over whisky these days.</b>

08:10.110 --> 08:13.490
<b>Then I'll send you some.
Along with a fishing rod.</b>

08:13.570 --> 08:15.160
<b>I like the sound of that.</b>

08:15.240 --> 08:18.030
<b>And let me guess, the rod is made by...</b>

08:18.660 --> 08:20.580
<b>AUZA, huh?</b>

08:22.830 --> 08:25.080
<b>You should take some time off.</b>

08:25.880 --> 08:29.500
<b>People make bad decisions
when they're tired, you know.</b>

08:29.960 --> 08:32.050
<b>Don't come in again
until your retirement day.</b>

08:32.130 --> 08:33.880
<b>That's my advice to you...</b>

08:33.970 --> 08:35.510
<b>as your ex-partner.</b>

08:46.480 --> 08:48.860
<b>Aw... It got burned all black again.</b>

08:50.480 --> 08:53.030
<b>That's why I said
you should let me handle it!</b>

08:54.240 --> 08:55.320
<b>I love you.</b>

08:55.820 --> 08:57.240
<b>Both of you.</b>

09:19.850 --> 09:22.140
<b>You got some nerve making me
come to the middle of nowhere.</b>

09:22.220 --> 09:24.600
<b>My car navigation
couldn't even find this place!</b>

09:24.890 --> 09:27.270
<b>It makes it easy to see anyone coming.</b>

09:27.400 --> 09:30.070
<b>Told them I'd pay for damages, ya know.</b>

09:30.150 --> 09:33.110
<b>But I didn't think it would be
for the whole friggin' restaurant.</b>

09:34.150 --> 09:38.990
<b>I feel bad for the old man,
they framed him with bogus charges.</b>

09:39.490 --> 09:42.910
<b>We're gonna have to try
and do something about that later.</b>

09:43.750 --> 09:46.210
<b>You up for some peking duck?</b>

09:48.830 --> 09:53.090
<b>An analysis revealed that a special alloy
was being used in this stuff.</b>

09:53.170 --> 09:56.130
<b>And the patent on that alloy
is held by....</b>

09:56.550 --> 09:57.680
<b>AUZA.</b>

09:58.640 --> 10:01.260
<b>It seems pretty obvious that there's
a connection between AUZA</b>

10:01.350 --> 10:03.890
<b>and the ninjas who attacked us.</b>

10:04.270 --> 10:08.270
<b>I'm going to keep digging
and see if I can find any more clues.</b>

10:08.650 --> 10:09.850
<b>AUZA...</b>

10:10.940 --> 10:15.570
<b>That company must be pretty damn dangerous
to be able to keep the FBI on a leash.</b>

10:16.070 --> 10:17.570
<b>They want me to back off.</b>

10:18.820 --> 10:20.320
<b>Makes sense, though.</b>

10:21.530 --> 10:23.120
<b>Considering I almost died back there.</b>

10:24.700 --> 10:27.250
<b>They've already killed me once.</b>

10:28.330 --> 10:31.920
<b>Now I'm going to hunt down
every last one of them and make them pay.</b>

10:32.000 --> 10:33.840
<b>You plan on murdering them all?</b>

10:34.960 --> 10:36.260
<b>Just so we're clear...</b>

10:36.340 --> 10:39.300
<b>when it comes down to it,
I'm going to have to arrest you.</b>

10:41.090 --> 10:42.300
<b>That being said,</b>

10:43.470 --> 10:47.390
<b>it looks like I've got a ton
of other perps to handcuff first.</b>

10:50.520 --> 10:52.810
<b>Protecting citizens from criminals.</b>

10:53.570 --> 10:55.650
<b>That's still my duty.</b>

10:56.690 --> 11:00.820
<b>Besides, I've never liked fishing.</b>

11:01.610 --> 11:03.410
<b>Here's to a temporary truce.</b>

11:03.490 --> 11:06.120
<b>Can't say I've had the experience
of dealing with shadowy freaks like ninjas</b>

11:06.200 --> 11:08.290
<b>despite my long tenure at the bureau.</b>

11:16.460 --> 11:18.170
<b>Sharing a drink.</b>

11:18.550 --> 11:20.050
<b>That's how alliances are formed.</b>

11:20.430 --> 11:24.300
<b>Still can't believe I have to work
with a sketchy weirdo like you...</b>

11:24.760 --> 11:27.930
<b>but I gotta get back at those bastards.</b>

11:28.480 --> 11:29.810
<b>For the old man.</b>

11:37.190 --> 11:39.240
<b>Wait a sec, this isn't even alcohol!</b>

11:39.320 --> 11:40.740
<b>It's an energy drink.</b>

11:40.820 --> 11:41.530
<b>Huh?!</b>

11:44.370 --> 11:45.580
<b>Seriously...</b>

11:46.580 --> 11:48.950
<b>I'll never understand you ninjas.</b>

11:49.040 --> 11:52.080
<b>It's not a ninja thing.
It's just what I like.</b>

11:52.170 --> 11:54.330
<b>Well, whatever.</b>

11:54.420 --> 11:55.790
<b>Onto the next subject...</b>

11:56.340 --> 11:58.630
<b>For the time being,
we have a lead with AUZA.</b>

11:59.130 --> 12:02.090
<b>And I've got someone on the way
who knows a thing or two about them.</b>

12:03.180 --> 12:04.680
<b>Oh, there they are.</b>

12:12.690 --> 12:15.520
<b>Why did it have to be her and not me?!</b>

12:15.610 --> 12:18.690
<b>I'm sorry, Jessie.
You're the only one for me.</b>

12:19.150 --> 12:20.320
<b>Oh, you...</b>

12:20.400 --> 12:23.820
<b>Do you remember what I taught you
back when you were a trainee?</b>

12:23.910 --> 12:26.950
<b>"Never be late for a meeting," right?</b>

12:27.030 --> 12:27.950
<b>Great.</b>

12:28.030 --> 12:32.370
<b>Then I guess the next lesson I gotta
teach you is the definition of "late."</b>

12:32.790 --> 12:34.670
<b>Roundabout sarcasm like that</b>

12:34.750 --> 12:37.460
<b>is totally gonna kill your popularity
with the ladies, ya know?</b>

12:37.540 --> 12:38.460
<b>Shut it!</b>

12:38.550 --> 12:39.920
<b>Listen, you're always the one who-</b>

12:40.010 --> 12:43.010
<b>Yeah, I get it!
But what else was I supposed to do?</b>

12:43.090 --> 12:44.840
<b>Not only did I need an excuse
to get out of work,</b>

12:44.930 --> 12:46.850
<b>but I had to go fetch this baby.</b>

12:46.930 --> 12:49.640
<b>I brought her all the way from home, okay?</b>

12:49.720 --> 12:51.810
<b>What's this junker of a car
got to do with anything?</b>

12:51.890 --> 12:54.690
<b>"Junker"?! You gotta be kidding me!</b>

12:54.770 --> 12:56.690
<b>Your ride is what we call a piece of junk!</b>

12:56.770 --> 12:59.730
<b>Huh? A car is good enough
as long as it still runs.</b>

12:59.820 --> 13:01.610
<b>You have no taste whatsoever.</b>

13:01.990 --> 13:04.450
<b>This is an early model
of a historic economy car</b>

13:04.530 --> 13:07.530
<b>that was built by one of the
best designers of the 20th century.</b>

13:07.620 --> 13:08.780
<b>You recognize it?!</b>

13:08.870 --> 13:12.450
<b>It has an air-cooled four-cylinder,
1500cc displacement engine.</b>

13:12.540 --> 13:15.330
<b>The bodywork with a
rear-mounted engine and rear-wheel drive</b>

13:15.420 --> 13:17.210
<b>was its most characteristic feature.</b>

13:19.380 --> 13:20.670
<b>It's a good car.</b>

13:20.960 --> 13:23.670
<b>That's a ninja for you! Superb taste!</b>

13:24.840 --> 13:27.510
<b>Calm down, she's on our side.</b>

13:27.590 --> 13:30.680
<b>Who do you think analyzed those weird,
futuristic weapons that we found?</b>

13:30.760 --> 13:33.350
<b>I've always been fascinated by ninjas!</b>

13:33.430 --> 13:34.520
<b>Hey, I've got a question for you.</b>

13:34.600 --> 13:37.600
<b>Is it true you guys planted fast-growing
trees to jump over as part of your trai-</b>

13:37.690 --> 13:39.360
<b>That's enough.</b>

13:39.440 --> 13:42.570
<b>I'm not here to chat
about cars and ninjas.</b>

13:42.650 --> 13:44.860
<b>Right, we're here to talk about AUZA.</b>

13:45.490 --> 13:46.700
<b>Please hop in.</b>

13:46.780 --> 13:49.120
<b>Why? We going somewhere?</b>

13:49.910 --> 13:51.530
<b>Not exactly.</b>

13:51.620 --> 13:53.750
<b>Christ, there's no room in here!</b>

13:53.830 --> 13:56.000
<b>C'mon. Scoot over a little more, would ya?</b>

13:56.080 --> 13:57.290
<b>Settle down now, boys.</b>

13:57.370 --> 13:58.920
<b>-Friggin'...
-You'll stop complaining</b>

13:59.000 --> 14:00.340
<b>after you see this.</b>

14:05.720 --> 14:06.630
<b>Hot damn!</b>

14:06.720 --> 14:08.590
<b>Welcome to my pride and joy.</b>

14:08.930 --> 14:12.720
<b>This car is basically a giant,
moving computer that I customized.</b>

14:13.310 --> 14:17.100
<b>I can gather any information that I need
from all over the world in here.</b>

14:17.520 --> 14:21.690
<b>So, I did my own research
on the company in question.</b>

14:21.770 --> 14:24.570
<b>AUZA is a multinational enterprise
involved in the development of</b>

14:24.650 --> 14:28.990
<b>military weapons, telecommunications,
entertainment, clean energy,</b>

14:29.070 --> 14:31.410
<b>and pretty much every technology
you can think of,</b>

14:31.490 --> 14:33.990
<b>with a high global market share to boot.</b>

14:34.330 --> 14:37.410
<b>The rate that AUZA has penetrated markets
across the world is insane.</b>

14:37.500 --> 14:39.080
<b>Their products are constantly replacing</b>

14:39.170 --> 14:41.460
<b>various software and
hardware systems day after day.</b>

14:41.540 --> 14:44.750
<b>It's safe to say there's no country
in the world without AUZA now.</b>

14:44.840 --> 14:45.920
<b>But at the same time,</b>

14:46.010 --> 14:49.680
<b>that rapid growth has given way
to a lot of dark rumors about the company.</b>

14:49.760 --> 14:51.220
<b>Like what?</b>

14:51.300 --> 14:55.060
<b>Well, there have been several key figures
from major rival enterprises,</b>

14:55.140 --> 14:57.600
<b>along with journalists
who were investigating alleged fraud,</b>

14:57.680 --> 15:01.190
<b>and other people who were
inconvenient to the company</b>

15:01.270 --> 15:02.940
<b>that have all died in mysterious ways.</b>

15:03.270 --> 15:04.730
<b>Even just recently...</b>

15:05.530 --> 15:08.360
<b>The man you see here was one of
the top conservative politicians</b>

15:08.450 --> 15:10.280
<b>well-known throughout Europe.</b>

15:10.570 --> 15:14.030
<b>He refused any and all foreign companies
from doing business in his country,</b>

15:14.120 --> 15:17.910
<b>until a week ago, when he passed away
in a sudden car accident.</b>

15:18.370 --> 15:20.250
<b>His successor is now
doing the exact opposite</b>

15:20.330 --> 15:22.290
<b>by actively attracting
foreign companies</b>

15:22.380 --> 15:25.380
<b>in the name of improving
domestic technology.</b>

15:25.670 --> 15:27.130
<b>And one of those companies is...</b>

15:27.210 --> 15:28.340
<b>AUZA.</b>

15:28.670 --> 15:32.680
<b>Yes, there have been too many convenient
deaths alongside AUZA's progress.</b>

15:32.760 --> 15:36.350
<b>My guess is that ninjas are the ones
behind it all.</b>

15:37.810 --> 15:40.480
<b>A big international corporation
and ninjas, huh?</b>

15:40.560 --> 15:41.940
<b>If this is all true...</b>

15:42.520 --> 15:45.230
<b>then we've got
a real nightmare on our hands.</b>

15:54.990 --> 15:56.330
<b>Magnificent.</b>

15:56.910 --> 15:59.080
<b>It never ceases to amaze me
whenever I see it!</b>

15:59.370 --> 16:01.750
<b>Regarding the AUZA Reactor here, sir...</b>

16:01.830 --> 16:03.630
<b>the output has increased since last time,</b>

16:03.710 --> 16:07.920
<b>and now it is capable of producing
2.2 million kilowatts of power per second.</b>

16:08.460 --> 16:11.130
<b>And our wireless power transfer system
that utilizes mili-wave beams</b>

16:11.220 --> 16:12.430
<b>is also making good progress.</b>

16:12.680 --> 16:15.510
<b>This is the light that will illuminate
the future, my friends!</b>

16:15.600 --> 16:17.680
<b>If we can make this
technology commonplace,</b>

16:17.760 --> 16:19.560
<b>then the world will never be the same!</b>

16:19.850 --> 16:23.480
<b>AUZA is the best
and must become the one and only!</b>

16:23.560 --> 16:27.730
<b>Because the magic that we produce here
will change people's lives.</b>

16:27.980 --> 16:30.150
<b>And then, in the near future,</b>

16:30.240 --> 16:32.320
<b>AUZA will be the new standard
for the world!</b>

16:45.040 --> 16:46.040
<b>Oh, hey!</b>

16:46.670 --> 16:48.250
<b>How nice to see you here!</b>

16:49.380 --> 16:52.510
<b>I would suggest that
we chat over dinner, but...</b>

16:53.510 --> 16:57.970
<b>seeing as how you came here directly,
it must be something urgent, right?</b>

17:00.970 --> 17:01.850
<b>Ah!</b>

17:01.930 --> 17:03.980
<b>Yes, those are guys from my team.</b>

17:04.270 --> 17:06.600
<b>We desperately needed
to get some field data</b>

17:06.690 --> 17:08.940
<b>on a weapon that we're developing.</b>

17:09.230 --> 17:13.740
<b>And a ninja is the perfect test subject,
since they have superhuman abilities.</b>

17:14.030 --> 17:16.530
<b>Of course, I made sure
they targeted an ex-ninja</b>

17:16.610 --> 17:18.870
<b>who has nothing to do
with your organization.</b>

17:22.500 --> 17:26.000
<b>Okay, I'll give you
a proper heads up next time.</b>

17:26.120 --> 17:29.090
<b>But we need more data
on the weapons we're developing.</b>

17:29.340 --> 17:31.420
<b>It benefits the goods provided
on your side as we-</b>

17:33.840 --> 17:35.550
<b>We're partners, remember!</b>

17:35.630 --> 17:37.930
<b>We need to work together
to build a better future.</b>

17:40.470 --> 17:42.810
<b>Don't pull a stunt like that ever again.</b>

17:46.730 --> 17:50.150
<b>This can be considered the center
of the huge enterprise known as AUZA,</b>

17:50.230 --> 17:51.570
<b>their main headquarters.</b>

17:51.940 --> 17:55.030
<b>It's the best starting point if we want
to figure out what AUZA is really up to</b>

17:55.110 --> 17:57.110
<b>and how the ninjas
figure into all of this.</b>

17:57.490 --> 18:00.410
<b>Their headquarters
are located here in AUZA City.</b>

18:00.490 --> 18:03.290
<b>It's an experimental city
that's run entirely by AUZA</b>

18:03.370 --> 18:07.290
<b>to test their various new technologies
and energy sources.</b>

18:07.370 --> 18:08.420
<b>Look here.</b>

18:10.290 --> 18:10.920
<b>Wha-</b>

18:14.420 --> 18:15.470
<b>Step on it!</b>

18:20.140 --> 18:20.930
<b>Shit!</b>

18:23.140 --> 18:24.890
<b>What the hell is happening?!</b>

18:33.020 --> 18:34.030
<b>Did you get him?</b>

18:34.110 --> 18:35.360
<b>Now those are serious ninja ski-</b>

21:27.320 --> 21:29.280
<b>Now we can finally talk...</b>

21:29.990 --> 21:31.200
<b>Higan.</b>
