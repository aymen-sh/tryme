<b>EPISODE FIVE
EVEN IF I DIE… THIS WORLD WILL CONTINUE</b>

00:10.900 --> 00:13.570
<b>Come on, Damian.</b>

00:14.320 --> 00:16.450
<b>Did you really need me for this?</b>

00:16.780 --> 00:20.450
<b>This heretic was assigned to Peter.</b>

00:20.910 --> 00:23.950
<b>You can't just loan him to me
for transfer duty.</b>

00:24.950 --> 00:26.080
<b>Nowak.</b>

00:26.410 --> 00:28.710
<b>For a long time, I've been wondering</b>

00:29.040 --> 00:30.630
<b>about your poor attitude.</b>

00:30.630 --> 00:31.630
<b>Huh?</b>

00:32.040 --> 00:33.880
<b>Our work is to serve God</b>

00:33.880 --> 00:37.090
<b>by defending the sanctity of faith.</b>

00:37.630 --> 00:39.340
<b>Complacency is inexcusable.</b>

00:39.720 --> 00:40.930
<b>Don't you realize</b>

00:40.930 --> 00:43.810
<b>that you'll be responsible
if something happens?</b>

00:43.810 --> 00:47.360
<b>Um, wait. I didn't mean…</b>

00:56.730 --> 00:58.570
<b>What? Hey!</b>

00:59.780 --> 01:01.070
<b>What's going on?</b>

01:01.570 --> 01:02.620
<b>What is it?</b>

01:02.620 --> 01:04.000
<b>The wagon in front.</b>

01:04.000 --> 01:05.910
<b>I saw the driver jump off, and now…</b>

01:06.870 --> 01:08.380
<b>What the…</b>

01:08.380 --> 01:09.880
<b>It's those watchmen.</b>

01:09.880 --> 01:11.290
<b>They've betrayed us.</b>

01:12.370 --> 01:14.000
<b>Stop here.</b>

01:19.630 --> 01:21.640
<b>H-Hey, is that permitted?</b>

01:21.640 --> 01:23.640
<b>This is an emergency.</b>

01:23.640 --> 01:25.600
<b>One shot should be fine.</b>

01:49.240 --> 01:50.670
<b>Oh, man.</b>

01:50.670 --> 01:53.170
<b>What a crash.</b>

01:53.170 --> 01:54.670
<b>It can't be saved now.</b>

01:58.090 --> 02:00.010
<b>P-Please help me!</b>

02:00.340 --> 02:01.340
<b>Huh?</b>

02:10.440 --> 02:12.190
<b>Wait!</b>

02:12.520 --> 02:14.150
<b>I was being threatened!</b>

02:14.150 --> 02:16.520
<b>You expect me to believe that?</b>

02:18.400 --> 02:19.410
<b>Well…</b>

02:27.780 --> 02:28.920
<b><i>He's fully focused.</i></b>

02:33.120 --> 02:35.040
<b><i>This guy is tough.</i></b>

02:35.370 --> 02:37.630
<b><i>I'd probably die fighting him.</i></b>

02:38.380 --> 02:40.550
<b><i>That leaves only one option.</i></b>

02:42.760 --> 02:44.010
<b>I surrender!</b>

02:44.010 --> 02:46.180
<b>I was wrong! Please have mercy!</b>

02:47.380 --> 02:48.390
<b>Huh?</b>

02:48.800 --> 02:50.270
<b>Seriously?</b>

02:50.270 --> 02:51.480
<b>But that's…</b>

02:51.480 --> 02:55.900
<b>What were the rules
for voluntary surrender again?</b>

02:56.230 --> 02:58.440
<b>Let's see.</b>

02:58.440 --> 03:01.400
<b>"Exercise your own judgment"?</b>

03:01.730 --> 03:04.200
<b>That's the biggest pain of all.</b>

03:05.240 --> 03:08.030
<b>Well, you already double-crossed us once.</b>

03:08.700 --> 03:10.370
<b>Would they allow this?</b>

03:10.700 --> 03:12.880
<b>You're of no use to me anyway.</b>

03:12.880 --> 03:13.870
<b>Huh?</b>

03:20.040 --> 03:21.260
<b>What?</b>

03:21.260 --> 03:22.220
<b>Why?</b>

03:23.500 --> 03:26.930
<b>Because history needs you.</b>

03:26.930 --> 03:28.220
<b>Take this.</b>

03:54.620 --> 03:56.170
<b>-Nowak!
-Huh?</b>

03:56.170 --> 03:58.290
<b>Should I bring your crossbow?</b>

03:58.620 --> 04:01.420
<b>No, don't bother.</b>

04:01.420 --> 04:03.760
<b>What? But why?</b>

04:04.170 --> 04:05.380
<b>It's not worth…</b>

04:06.760 --> 04:10.850
<b>Um, I'd only get in trouble
for using more arrows.</b>

04:11.550 --> 04:14.020
<b>Plus, the thing we need to secure</b>

04:14.510 --> 04:17.020
<b>is lying right here.</b>

04:19.940 --> 04:23.360
<b>As a former soldier myself,
I know it all too well.</b>

04:23.360 --> 04:26.320
<b>Those two can't read a word.</b>

04:26.650 --> 04:29.070
<b>They don't have the brains for heresy.</b>

04:30.820 --> 04:33.740
<b>There's no use going after them.</b>

04:58.230 --> 05:00.820
<b>ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH</b>

06:24.180 --> 06:25.610
<b>Um…</b>

06:26.020 --> 06:29.780
<b>I won't run, so you can lower your sword.</b>

06:29.780 --> 06:32.070
<b>Oh, right.</b>

06:36.820 --> 06:39.460
<b>I'm sorry I got you mixed up in this.</b>

06:39.910 --> 06:44.000
<b>Even so, I'm not looking for a do-over.</b>

06:44.410 --> 06:46.380
<b>Given another chance,</b>

06:46.380 --> 06:48.420
<b>I'd probably make the same choice.</b>

06:48.420 --> 06:50.970
<b>So my apology is a bit insincere.</b>

06:51.420 --> 06:54.640
<b>I apologize for that too.</b>

06:56.340 --> 06:59.260
<b>Oh, uh… I understand.</b>

07:12.730 --> 07:15.240
<b>This looks like a clearing.</b>

07:15.570 --> 07:18.200
<b>We might be near the middle of the slope.</b>

07:18.530 --> 07:19.620
<b>Let's look around.</b>

07:37.970 --> 07:39.010
<b>Gras!</b>

07:45.310 --> 07:47.480
<b>I-Is this it?</b>

08:09.040 --> 08:12.500
<b>What is… this diagram?</b>

08:13.720 --> 08:16.180
<b>These seem like letters.</b>

08:16.180 --> 08:17.630
<b>There are two.</b>

08:17.970 --> 08:20.430
<b>One is dated recently, and the other</b>

08:21.300 --> 08:22.810
<b>is from ten years ago.</b>

08:24.470 --> 08:26.480
<b>Can I see the recent one?</b>

08:26.480 --> 08:28.350
<b>It might be from the heretic.</b>

08:33.020 --> 08:35.610
<b>Damn it, my eye…</b>

08:36.570 --> 08:37.780
<b>Let's see.</b>

08:39.240 --> 08:40.620
<b>First, let me state</b>

08:41.280 --> 08:44.580
<b>that I did not create
the contents of this stone chest.</b>

08:44.910 --> 08:46.410
<b>I discovered them.</b>

08:47.200 --> 08:52.050
<b>Therefore, I will record
the story of that discovery.</b>

08:53.000 --> 08:55.260
<b><i>As an astrologer,</i></b>

08:55.260 --> 08:58.130
<b><i>I made a daily habit</i>
<i>of observing the heavens.</i></b>

08:58.590 --> 09:01.640
<b><i>One day, while seeking</i>
<i>greater elevation and visibility,</i></b>

09:01.640 --> 09:04.810
<b><i>I discovered a spot</i>
<i>that was perfect for observation.</i></b>

09:05.470 --> 09:07.930
<b><i>Then I noticed something curious.</i></b>

09:08.310 --> 09:11.650
<b><i>Carved into each</i>
<i>of the two nearby rock formations</i></b>

09:11.650 --> 09:14.700
<b><i>were three stars</i>
<i>with a mark in the center.</i></b>

09:15.400 --> 09:17.900
<b><i>It resembled Orion's Belt.</i></b>

09:18.780 --> 09:21.370
<b><i>As if corresponding to the middle star,</i></b>

09:21.700 --> 09:23.410
<b><i>the space between the rocks</i></b>

09:23.410 --> 09:26.540
<b><i>was in line with the middle</i>
<i>of the mountain on the opposite side.</i></b>

09:26.540 --> 09:29.210
<b><i>What could possibly be there?</i></b>

09:29.210 --> 09:31.630
<b><i>Who had done this and why?</i></b>

09:32.460 --> 09:36.130
<b><i>Spurred by curiosity,</i>
<i>I made my way to the mountain.</i></b>

09:38.500 --> 09:41.130
<b><i>And finally, I encountered this chest.</i></b>

09:42.300 --> 09:47.350
<b>"In the end, I never learned
who left the chest behind</b>

09:47.680 --> 09:49.560
<b>or why they had done so."</b>

09:49.560 --> 09:52.980
<b>"But though the contents
of the chest were incomplete,</b>

09:52.980 --> 09:57.530
<b>it was clear to me that they could change
the history and fate of humankind."</b>

09:58.190 --> 10:01.330
<b>"Even if I were to die
because of the contents of this chest,</b>

10:01.330 --> 10:06.030
<b>I can say my life was fortunate
for having discovered them."</b>

10:11.450 --> 10:15.170
<b>"For further details, I ask that
you confirm the materials herein."</b>

10:15.500 --> 10:19.840
<b>"Selfishly, I too
have adjusted multiple calculations."</b>

10:20.750 --> 10:21.840
<b>"That is all."</b>

10:23.170 --> 10:25.140
<b>What does the other letter say?</b>

10:25.140 --> 10:26.180
<b>Huh?</b>

10:28.970 --> 10:31.150
<b>I don't know.</b>

10:31.150 --> 10:33.270
<b>I never learned to read.</b>

10:33.890 --> 10:37.770
<b>Oh, but…
I think I know what the title says.</b>

10:38.150 --> 10:39.530
<b>What's that?</b>

10:41.400 --> 10:42.400
<b>Earth.</b>

10:43.030 --> 10:48.040
<b>ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH
CHAPTER TWO</b>

10:52.580 --> 10:53.670
<b>It's no use.</b>

10:53.670 --> 10:55.420
<b>This bridge is broken too.</b>

10:55.420 --> 10:56.840
<b>We'll have to go around.</b>

10:57.460 --> 10:58.960
<b>From where we are…</b>

11:05.010 --> 11:06.770
<b><i>I forgot about this thing.</i></b>

11:11.100 --> 11:12.520
<b>You're throwing it away?</b>

11:12.520 --> 11:13.650
<b>Yes.</b>

11:13.650 --> 11:16.060
<b>It belonged to the heretic, after all.</b>

11:16.770 --> 11:19.110
<b>Still, it's an important clue.</b>

11:19.560 --> 11:20.980
<b>I'll take it.</b>

11:25.150 --> 11:26.660
<b>Now, let's go.</b>

11:32.030 --> 11:33.080
<b>Earth?</b>

11:33.080 --> 11:35.830
<b>Yes. That's what the envelope says.</b>

11:36.290 --> 11:38.040
<b>Hand it to me. I'll read it.</b>

11:40.170 --> 11:41.170
<b>Let's see.</b>

11:41.750 --> 11:44.170
<b>"I offer you the secrets
of the starry sky."</b>

11:44.500 --> 11:48.090
<b>"If any profit should be earned
from this endeavor,</b>

11:48.510 --> 11:51.600
<b>ten percent should be given to Potocki."</b>

11:52.010 --> 11:54.350
<b>"His support has been valuable."</b>

11:54.680 --> 11:55.850
<b>"His address is…"</b>

11:56.350 --> 11:57.570
<b>Well,</b>

11:57.570 --> 11:59.940
<b>this doesn't tell us anything either.</b>

12:01.020 --> 12:03.150
<b>What the heck is in here?</b>

12:05.070 --> 12:07.370
<b>As far as these documents go,</b>

12:07.370 --> 12:09.870
<b>I'd guess they're related to astronomy.</b>

12:10.530 --> 12:12.250
<b>However, I can't read Latin</b>

12:12.250 --> 12:14.870
<b>or understand the figures.</b>

12:15.370 --> 12:17.920
<b>As far as our future is concerned,</b>

12:18.750 --> 12:20.130
<b>because of my actions,</b>

12:20.130 --> 12:22.840
<b>you won't be welcome
in town or at the guild.</b>

12:23.920 --> 12:26.170
<b>But if I may justify myself,</b>

12:26.840 --> 12:28.850
<b>the circumstances we're in</b>

12:28.850 --> 12:30.850
<b>can be turned to our advantage.</b>

12:31.760 --> 12:33.600
<b>Judging by the volume,</b>

12:33.600 --> 12:36.100
<b>these materials weren't made on a whim.</b>

12:36.930 --> 12:38.690
<b>They're something significant.</b>

12:39.810 --> 12:41.570
<b>Show them to the right person,</b>

12:41.570 --> 12:43.480
<b>and the reward could be big.</b>

12:43.860 --> 12:46.780
<b>Plus, we'd get to learn
about the contents.</b>

12:46.780 --> 12:49.780
<b>Where will you find this "right person"?</b>

12:51.240 --> 12:53.990
<b>I actually have someone in mind.</b>

12:55.080 --> 12:58.120
<b><i>The monk that told me about the planets.</i></b>

12:58.700 --> 13:00.580
<b><i>I believe his name was</i></b>

13:00.910 --> 13:02.130
<b><i>Badeni.</i></b>

13:02.710 --> 13:05.710
<b>You want to discuss heresy with a monk?!</b>

13:06.040 --> 13:08.590
<b>He's no ordinary monk.</b>

13:08.920 --> 13:11.720
<b>He was demoted a short time ago.</b>

13:12.470 --> 13:14.810
<b>The reasons were unruly behavior</b>

13:15.220 --> 13:17.100
<b>and contrarian thought.</b>

13:18.810 --> 13:20.060
<b>Perfect, right?</b>

13:20.520 --> 13:22.770
<b>With that settled, let's go.</b>

13:26.440 --> 13:27.740
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

13:28.730 --> 13:31.490
<b>My… head is spinning.</b>

13:32.290 --> 13:36.410
<b>I've come this far,
but now that I have time to think,</b>

13:37.240 --> 13:40.870
<b>I don't see why I should go with you.</b>

13:43.920 --> 13:46.420
<b>Will you decide for me, Gras?</b>

13:46.420 --> 13:47.760
<b>If I should go or not…</b>

13:52.090 --> 13:54.350
<b>Two is safer than one,</b>

13:54.350 --> 13:56.770
<b>so I'd appreciate a companion.</b>

13:57.550 --> 14:00.060
<b>In that case, I'll go with you.</b>

14:08.270 --> 14:09.280
<b>Oczy.</b>

14:11.030 --> 14:13.910
<b>Could you find the North Star for me?</b>

14:14.240 --> 14:15.740
<b>We should orient ourselves.</b>

14:16.160 --> 14:18.580
<b>I'm afraid I injured my eye earlier.</b>

14:20.120 --> 14:22.460
<b>Forgive me, but I can't do that.</b>

14:23.120 --> 14:24.130
<b>Huh?</b>

14:24.130 --> 14:26.010
<b>But with your vision…</b>

14:26.010 --> 14:28.760
<b>I… can't look at the sky.</b>

14:28.760 --> 14:29.760
<b>I, uh…</b>

14:31.130 --> 14:32.970
<b>I'm afraid.</b>

14:33.920 --> 14:36.600
<b><i>A priest told me something once.</i></b>

14:36.980 --> 14:38.850
<b><i>The night sky is beautiful</i></b>

14:39.180 --> 14:42.730
<b><i>because we gaze at it</i>
<i>from the lowly Earth.</i></b>

14:44.020 --> 14:47.200
<b>Since then, when I look at the sky,</b>

14:47.900 --> 14:51.570
<b>the stars appear to me like eyes
looking down on humankind.</b>

14:53.070 --> 14:54.910
<b>I know that sounds strange.</b>

14:56.150 --> 14:59.120
<b>Before that, could you look at the stars?</b>

14:59.530 --> 15:01.200
<b>Y-Yes.</b>

15:01.580 --> 15:03.080
<b>Actually…</b>

15:05.040 --> 15:07.090
<b>I think I enjoyed it.</b>

15:09.420 --> 15:12.590
<b>You've never had the urge
to see the stars again?</b>

15:13.920 --> 15:16.850
<b>No. It's too scary.</b>

15:17.180 --> 15:19.560
<b>But if it was something you enjoyed,</b>

15:19.560 --> 15:21.810
<b>it's a shame to give it up, right?</b>

15:22.140 --> 15:23.640
<b>I guess so…</b>

15:25.890 --> 15:28.860
<b>Then again, it doesn't concern you, Gras.</b>

15:30.150 --> 15:31.570
<b>Of course not.</b>

15:32.020 --> 15:35.360
<b>But I lost my family in the past,</b>

15:35.690 --> 15:38.620
<b>so I know what it's like
to lose the things you love.</b>

15:40.530 --> 15:44.620
<b>Compared to that, my problem is minor.</b>

15:44.950 --> 15:47.580
<b>After all, I'm still alive.</b>

15:48.580 --> 15:50.300
<b>That's not true.</b>

15:50.630 --> 15:53.470
<b>For you, it's a major problem.</b>

15:53.920 --> 15:55.380
<b>Oh, but…</b>

15:56.130 --> 15:59.980
<b>In your case,
I'm sure they were never lost.</b>

16:01.230 --> 16:04.310
<b>Your family is surely in heaven now.</b>

16:04.640 --> 16:07.190
<b>You'll reunite with them there.</b>

16:09.060 --> 16:11.980
<b>Thank you. I believe so too.</b>

16:12.940 --> 16:14.150
<b>However,</b>

16:14.570 --> 16:16.450
<b>what I really lost</b>

16:16.780 --> 16:19.330
<b>was my hope for this world.</b>

16:21.210 --> 16:23.410
<b>Until recently,</b>

16:24.030 --> 16:27.330
<b>I did nothing but curse this world
that stole my family.</b>

16:28.040 --> 16:29.840
<b>But when I thought deeper,</b>

16:29.840 --> 16:32.630
<b>this world was where I met my family too.</b>

16:33.790 --> 16:35.380
<b>And if that's the case,</b>

16:35.710 --> 16:38.590
<b>I don't want to deny
the world that gave them to me.</b>

16:39.420 --> 16:41.350
<b>It may be difficult,</b>

16:41.680 --> 16:44.770
<b>but I want to view
the world positively once more.</b>

16:46.890 --> 16:48.360
<b>This may sound cruel,</b>

16:48.360 --> 16:50.400
<b>but I don't think that's possible.</b>

16:52.850 --> 16:55.030
<b>Heaven is our only hope.</b>

16:55.360 --> 16:57.070
<b>This world is corrupt.</b>

16:57.400 --> 16:58.530
<b>It's that way</b>

16:58.530 --> 17:01.450
<b>because that was God's will.</b>

17:01.450 --> 17:05.250
<b>The great figures in history
have told us that.</b>

17:06.700 --> 17:07.790
<b>Have you…</b>

17:09.370 --> 17:13.590
<b>Have you completely given up on our world?</b>

17:17.250 --> 17:18.430
<b>Yes.</b>

17:18.430 --> 17:20.970
<b>Only loss awaits us here.</b>

17:21.470 --> 17:25.310
<b>We're all going to die anyway
and end up in heaven or hell.</b>

17:25.640 --> 17:27.850
<b>So that should be our bigger concern.</b>

17:38.070 --> 17:40.610
<b><i>"Heaven is our only hope"?</i></b>

17:41.820 --> 17:43.790
<b><i>So then, why did that heretic</i></b>

17:44.240 --> 17:47.580
<b><i>risk his life and his place in paradise</i></b>

17:47.580 --> 17:49.120
<b><i>to honor our world?</i></b>

17:50.830 --> 17:52.420
<b><i>Humans die.</i></b>

17:52.750 --> 17:55.800
<b><i>What would be the point</i>
<i>in loving this world</i></b>

17:55.800 --> 17:57.460
<b><i>that we will eventually leave?</i></b>

17:58.510 --> 18:01.970
<b><i>When we die, all that remains</i>
<i>is a world without us.</i></b>

18:02.970 --> 18:05.050
<b><i>How could there be hope in that?</i></b>

18:13.390 --> 18:14.400
<b><i>Wait.</i></b>

18:16.150 --> 18:18.400
<b><i>Could that be it?</i></b>

18:25.530 --> 18:27.830
<b>Oh, good. This bridge is standing.</b>

18:28.160 --> 18:30.210
<b>The village is on the other side.</b>

18:31.040 --> 18:33.630
<b>I guess we're safe for now.</b>

18:48.930 --> 18:50.860
<b>-Oczy.
-Yes?</b>

18:51.560 --> 18:54.610
<b>I've made you come with me this far.</b>

18:54.610 --> 18:55.980
<b>So from this point,</b>

18:55.980 --> 18:57.690
<b>I'd like you to choose.</b>

18:58.020 --> 18:59.110
<b>What?</b>

18:59.560 --> 19:01.740
<b>There are two paths you can take.</b>

19:01.740 --> 19:03.780
<b>First, when we reach the village,</b>

19:03.780 --> 19:07.240
<b>you can report what happened
and the chest we found to the Church.</b>

19:08.070 --> 19:10.870
<b>Do that, and maybe
you can return to the village.</b>

19:10.870 --> 19:12.750
<b>You'll get closer to heaven too.</b>

19:13.080 --> 19:15.880
<b>But what will happen to you?</b>

19:19.210 --> 19:20.340
<b>The second option…</b>

19:32.060 --> 19:33.400
<b>Gras!</b>

19:42.730 --> 19:44.650
<b>This is my…</b>

19:45.570 --> 19:47.160
<b>I'll be brief with the second.</b>

19:47.160 --> 19:50.160
<b>What?! This isn't the time!</b>

19:50.160 --> 19:51.710
<b>The second option</b>

19:51.710 --> 19:53.750
<b>is to ignore the first</b>

19:53.750 --> 19:55.670
<b>and place your hope in this world!</b>

19:55.670 --> 19:56.620
<b>What?</b>

19:56.960 --> 19:58.380
<b>And then, someday,</b>

19:58.380 --> 20:00.930
<b>turn your eyes to the stars again.</b>

20:09.430 --> 20:11.060
<b>What are you doing?!</b>

20:11.510 --> 20:12.940
<b>The ivy will tear!</b>

20:12.940 --> 20:14.980
<b>D-Do you want to die?!</b>

20:14.980 --> 20:17.400
<b>What are <i>you </i>doing?!</b>

20:18.430 --> 20:20.740
<b>-I'm passing the torch.
-What?!</b>

20:21.350 --> 20:23.610
<b>At this rate, we'll both die.</b>

20:23.610 --> 20:25.110
<b>That won't do.</b>

20:25.110 --> 20:27.580
<b>That heretic risked his life</b>

20:27.580 --> 20:29.700
<b>because he found someone to pass it on to.</b>

20:30.700 --> 20:32.410
<b>Just as you said,</b>

20:32.410 --> 20:34.630
<b>this world is full of loss.</b>

20:35.120 --> 20:36.380
<b>Furthermore,</b>

20:36.380 --> 20:38.630
<b>we will all die and leave here someday.</b>

20:38.630 --> 20:42.500
<b>But even if I die…
this world will continue.</b>

20:43.330 --> 20:45.630
<b>That means I can pass the torch.</b>

20:46.010 --> 20:50.020
<b>In a world that is full of loss,
that is one way</b>

20:50.470 --> 20:51.800
<b>that hope is born.</b>

20:53.510 --> 20:55.980
<b>Pass it to whom?! To me?!</b>

20:55.980 --> 20:57.610
<b>Don't expect anything from me!</b>

20:57.610 --> 20:59.780
<b>There's no guarantee I'll do it!</b>

21:00.230 --> 21:01.360
<b>That's true.</b>

21:01.690 --> 21:03.320
<b>But you will.</b>

21:03.650 --> 21:06.030
<b>You aren't ready to go to heaven.</b>

21:06.030 --> 21:07.780
<b>Why?!</b>

21:09.570 --> 21:11.320
<b>Because your face tells me</b>

21:11.650 --> 21:13.410
<b>that you still fear death.</b>

21:24.380 --> 21:25.760
<b><i>This</i></b>

21:26.090 --> 21:27.260
<b><i>is my fate.</i></b>

21:51.110 --> 21:52.910
<b>H-He's dead.</b>

22:10.300 --> 22:13.930
<b>You really are kind, Grabowski.</b>

22:13.930 --> 22:17.010
<b>You always take the time to listen to us.</b>

22:17.350 --> 22:20.190
<b>That's because I enjoy
hearing your stories.</b>

22:20.640 --> 22:22.310
<b>There you go again.</b>

22:22.640 --> 22:25.860
<b>Unlike that subdeacon from before…</b>

22:25.860 --> 22:27.650
<b>What was his name again?</b>

22:27.980 --> 22:30.320
<b>He's nothing like you.</b>

22:30.320 --> 22:31.950
<b>Indeed.</b>

22:31.950 --> 22:34.490
<b>He may have been praised in the city,</b>

22:34.490 --> 22:36.410
<b>but he's got no compassion.</b>

22:37.990 --> 22:39.580
<b>Oh, don't say that.</b>

22:41.590 --> 22:42.540
<b>Huh?</b>

22:43.120 --> 22:44.330
<b>-What?
-What?</b>

22:52.420 --> 22:53.510
<b>Excuse me.</b>

22:54.220 --> 22:56.680
<b>You have a visitor, Badeni.</b>

22:57.680 --> 22:59.720
<b>I'm not expecting a visitor.</b>

23:00.890 --> 23:02.980
<b>That may be, but…</b>

23:14.190 --> 23:15.540
<b>Who are you?</b>

23:15.540 --> 23:16.700
<b>What do you want?</b>

24:55.970 --> 25:01.010
