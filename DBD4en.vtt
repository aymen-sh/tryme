<b><i>Hee, hee hee!</i></b>

00:28.190 --> 00:32.650
<b><i>Time to adventure!</i>
<i>You'll be hooked for sure!</i></b>

00:33.240 --> 00:37.370
<b><i>The Demon Realm is full of mystery</i></b>

01:49.100 --> 01:50.150
<b>Huh?</b>

01:55.030 --> 01:59.450
<b>CHATTY</b>

02:05.410 --> 02:08.290
<b>Blast it. I know I locked it.</b>

02:08.870 --> 02:10.330
<b>What now?</b>

02:10.420 --> 02:12.130
<b>Will we be able to return to Earth?</b>

02:12.750 --> 02:14.630
<b>I'll figure out something.</b>

02:15.300 --> 02:19.090
<b>Let's keep walking and find a vehicle.</b>

02:19.180 --> 02:21.220
<b>It'll be easy if we just fly.</b>

02:21.850 --> 02:23.720
<b>You can all fly, right?</b>

02:23.810 --> 02:26.270
<b>Long distances are difficult in this air.</b>

02:27.350 --> 02:30.850
<b>It expends a lot of energy
and will tire you out quickly.</b>

02:30.940 --> 02:31.900
<b>Huh.</b>

02:31.980 --> 02:33.360
<b>Hup!</b>

02:34.400 --> 02:35.320
<b>Huh?</b>

02:38.860 --> 02:40.910
<b>Yeah, it's heavy.</b>

02:44.160 --> 02:47.410
<b>So the air's heavy. I get it.</b>

02:47.500 --> 02:50.670
<b>Depleting our stamina traveling
would be dangerous.</b>

02:50.750 --> 02:51.580
<b>Let's walk.</b>

03:00.380 --> 03:02.340
<b>Oh? It's a dead end.</b>

03:07.270 --> 03:08.520
<b>What do we do?</b>

03:08.600 --> 03:10.020
<b>Let's fly here.</b>

03:12.020 --> 03:14.020
<b>Hup! Whoops!</b>

03:15.320 --> 03:19.190
<b>I guess you need to fly to get anywhere
in the Demon World, huh?</b>

03:19.280 --> 03:23.410
<b>We could get around easily
if we had a plane.</b>

03:24.410 --> 03:28.370
<b>Falling into the Sea of Darkness
would be bad, so let's be careful.</b>

03:39.420 --> 03:43.180
<b>Goku-san, your movements
aren't as sharp as they usually are.</b>

03:43.260 --> 03:45.300
<b>I still ain't used to the air yet.</b>

03:48.470 --> 03:52.350
<b>What is this place?
You can't let your guard down, can you?</b>

03:54.230 --> 03:55.560
<b>I'll deal with it.</b>

04:11.580 --> 04:12.410
<b>Begone.</b>

04:29.560 --> 04:32.930
<b>Wow, you ain't bad at all!</b>

04:33.520 --> 04:36.600
<b>You might be stronger
than Supreme Kai-sama.</b>

04:36.690 --> 04:39.400
<b>I'm a pretty good fighter myself.</b>

04:40.530 --> 04:42.110
<b>Let's keep going.</b>

04:44.990 --> 04:47.160
<b>I'm so hungry.</b>

04:47.240 --> 04:49.830
<b>Try to hold out until the next town.</b>

04:49.910 --> 04:53.750
<b>Ain't there any good fruits or anythin'?</b>

04:58.500 --> 05:01.880
<b>Huh? Someone's hidin' for an ambush again.</b>

05:09.850 --> 05:11.760
<b>Man, my body feels heavy.</b>

05:24.190 --> 05:25.780
<b>Whew, that was tiring.</b>

05:27.450 --> 05:28.990
<b>How did you know it was there?</b>

05:30.070 --> 05:32.660
<b>I didn't see anything.</b>

05:32.740 --> 05:34.830
<b>Right. Its Ki.</b>

05:34.910 --> 05:36.500
<b>I sensed its Ki.</b>

05:36.580 --> 05:38.210
<b>Ki?</b>

05:38.290 --> 05:39.710
<b>What is that?</b>

05:39.790 --> 05:43.000
<b>He can sense an invisible sort of energy.</b>

05:47.680 --> 05:49.510
<b>Hm? There's somethin'.</b>

05:50.260 --> 05:52.220
<b>It looks like a shop.</b>

05:52.310 --> 05:54.060
<b>Let's take a break there.</b>

05:54.140 --> 05:56.680
<b>At last! I can eat!</b>

06:01.270 --> 06:03.230
<b>I'm starvin'!</b>

06:03.320 --> 06:04.230
<b>Boo!</b>

06:06.940 --> 06:10.160
<b>Sorry for the wait. Here's your tea.</b>

06:10.740 --> 06:13.490
<b>And this is our highly recommended dish.</b>

06:16.250 --> 06:17.580
<b>That smells delish!</b>

06:18.290 --> 06:19.870
<b>It's skewered lizard.</b>

06:20.960 --> 06:22.710
<b>Time to eat!</b>

06:27.630 --> 06:29.090
<b>This is good!</b>

06:31.840 --> 06:33.350
<b>What's this?</b>

06:33.430 --> 06:35.680
<b>Herb juice with honey.</b>

06:35.770 --> 06:38.940
<b>It's our special menu. It's delicious!</b>

06:43.900 --> 06:45.480
<b>Bitter!</b>

06:46.480 --> 06:49.860
<b>That flavor really grows on you.</b>

06:49.950 --> 06:54.120
<b>It's full of nutrition
and the healthiest drink in the world.</b>

06:56.410 --> 07:00.580
<b>Glorio-san. You said we'd find
another vehicle somewhere.</b>

07:00.670 --> 07:01.830
<b>Do you have an idea where?</b>

07:01.920 --> 07:03.790
<b>Well…</b>

07:09.880 --> 07:12.470
<b>Honey, you're needed!</b>

07:13.850 --> 07:15.300
<b>What is it?</b>

07:15.970 --> 07:17.770
<b>Do you have a plane?</b>

07:18.680 --> 07:19.730
<b>What?</b>

07:19.810 --> 07:21.270
<b>We're looking for a plane.</b>

07:21.980 --> 07:23.650
<b>Hmm…</b>

07:25.900 --> 07:27.480
<b>What was that?</b>

07:27.570 --> 07:31.570
<b>Honey! They need a plane! A plane!</b>

07:31.650 --> 07:33.110
<b>Right.</b>

07:33.700 --> 07:39.040
<b>I haven't got anything that valuable,
but I can sell you a Sky Seed for 8,000.</b>

07:39.750 --> 07:41.750
<b>A Sky Seed…</b>

07:41.830 --> 07:42.870
<b>What's the distance?</b>

07:42.960 --> 07:43.920
<b>Hm?</b>

07:44.750 --> 07:46.840
<b>He's asking the distance!</b>

07:46.920 --> 07:48.840
<b>Ah, right, right.</b>

07:48.920 --> 07:53.720
<b>For you and two kids,
probably around 120 kilos.</b>

07:54.510 --> 07:58.060
<b>120 kilometers… For 8,000 dokuro…</b>

07:58.850 --> 08:00.180
<b>That's a little pricey.</b>

08:01.770 --> 08:03.600
<b>I guess I'll try elsewhere.</b>

08:04.190 --> 08:07.650
<b>I-I'll take 5,000! How's that?!</b>

08:09.690 --> 08:12.070
<b>There's a lot of weird stuff.</b>

08:14.450 --> 08:15.870
<b>I wonder what this is?</b>

08:15.950 --> 08:17.450
<b>Maybe a piece of candy?</b>

08:18.580 --> 08:22.460
<b>Ah, it's a dead bug. What's it doin' here?</b>

08:22.540 --> 08:23.370
<b>A bug?!</b>

08:23.460 --> 08:27.340
<b>You boys aren't from around here, are you?</b>

08:28.630 --> 08:30.960
<b>That's a Revive Bug.</b>

08:31.050 --> 08:34.680
<b>It's a kind of Medi Bug
that'll restore stamina if you eat it.</b>

08:34.760 --> 08:38.970
<b>Huh. That's cool.
So it's like a Senzu Bean.</b>

08:39.720 --> 08:42.020
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

08:42.100 --> 08:43.810
<b>There seem to be a lot of different bugs.</b>

08:43.890 --> 08:48.190
<b>Yes. We've got most of the different types
of Medi Bugs you can find around here.</b>

08:48.270 --> 08:51.940
<b>Achichi Bugs for burns,
Zutsu Bugs for headaches,</b>

08:52.030 --> 08:54.700
<b>Beaut Bugs to make your skin silky smooth.</b>

08:54.780 --> 08:57.110
<b>What's this bug?</b>

08:57.910 --> 08:59.910
<b>That's a Join Bug.</b>

08:59.990 --> 09:01.620
<b>Feed halves to two people</b>

09:01.700 --> 09:05.080
<b>and they can fuse for a while
making them stronger.</b>

09:05.160 --> 09:08.500
<b>Wow! That's a Fusion!</b>

09:08.580 --> 09:10.630
<b>Hey, Goliro!</b>

09:11.210 --> 09:12.590
<b>It's Glorio.</b>

09:13.760 --> 09:14.670
<b>What is it?</b>

09:14.760 --> 09:17.430
<b>Could you buy some of these bugs?</b>

09:18.340 --> 09:19.470
<b>Bugs?</b>

09:19.550 --> 09:21.260
<b>Ah, Medi Bugs.</b>

09:21.350 --> 09:24.390
<b>Really?! How very nice!</b>

09:24.480 --> 09:28.150
<b>We haven't sold souvenirs
here for decades!</b>

09:31.110 --> 09:32.940
<b>Thanks a lot, Goliro!</b>

09:33.650 --> 09:34.570
<b>It's Glorio.</b>

09:35.740 --> 09:37.280
<b>Hey. This way.</b>

09:43.290 --> 09:45.040
<b>Wait here.</b>

09:45.120 --> 09:48.120
<b>"Sky Seed boarding here"?</b>

09:48.210 --> 09:49.380
<b>What's that?</b>

09:49.460 --> 09:52.000
<b>I've never heard of one before.</b>

09:52.550 --> 09:56.470
<b>Step right up! Here we go!</b>

09:56.550 --> 09:59.840
<b>A dream flight for you and me
for a love-filled night!</b>

09:59.930 --> 10:05.060
<b>The ever-popular Sky Seed boarding
is right here!</b>

10:07.270 --> 10:09.520
<b>Looks kinda interestin'!</b>

10:09.600 --> 10:13.730
<b>Here we go! Three to go, right?!</b>

10:13.820 --> 10:19.360
<b>The Sky Seed will be here momentarily!
Wait right where you are!</b>

10:19.990 --> 10:22.330
<b>What kind of amazin' ride is it?!</b>

10:32.130 --> 10:34.210
<b>What is that?</b>

10:34.800 --> 10:37.880
<b>A seed of a Great Fiend Flower
called a Sky Seed.</b>

10:43.510 --> 10:46.350
<b>It's not quite what I imagined.</b>

10:48.430 --> 10:50.190
<b>There we go.</b>

10:50.270 --> 10:51.810
<b>So, where are you headed?</b>

10:52.400 --> 10:53.860
<b>That direction.</b>

10:53.940 --> 10:55.780
<b>Sure thing.</b>

10:58.240 --> 10:59.150
<b>Okay!</b>

10:59.240 --> 11:00.110
<b>Right!</b>

11:01.030 --> 11:02.990
<b>Sorry to keep you waiting!</b>

11:03.070 --> 11:05.790
<b>Your destination is up to you!</b>

11:05.870 --> 11:10.410
<b>Now step right up
and take a seat, my friends!</b>

11:13.170 --> 11:14.840
<b>Like this?</b>

11:14.920 --> 11:17.050
<b>I wonder how it moves.</b>

11:17.130 --> 11:21.550
<b>You boys hold onto the gentleman in front!</b>

11:21.630 --> 11:23.800
<b>Keep your heads down!</b>

11:25.260 --> 11:29.890
<b>I'm removing the tail now,
so hold on tight!</b>

11:32.020 --> 11:35.310
<b>Five… Four… Three…</b>

11:35.400 --> 11:37.730
<b>Two… One…</b>

11:37.820 --> 11:40.150
<b>Liftoff!</b>

11:43.990 --> 11:46.120
<b>Take care!</b>

11:47.830 --> 11:49.290
<b>This is so fast!</b>

11:49.370 --> 11:50.790
<b>Hold on tight!</b>

11:58.750 --> 12:01.170
<b>Whoa! This feels great!</b>

12:01.840 --> 12:03.050
<b>This is rather nice.</b>

12:06.550 --> 12:10.020
<b>Glorio-san, how are you driving this?</b>

12:10.100 --> 12:11.270
<b>I'm not.</b>

12:11.350 --> 12:12.310
<b>Huh?</b>

12:13.060 --> 12:14.650
<b>The seed is just flying.</b>

12:14.730 --> 12:16.190
<b>Wait a minute…</b>

12:16.900 --> 12:19.610
<b>Does that mean we're going to fall?!</b>

12:19.690 --> 12:23.490
<b>That's right. So we need to get off it
before it crashes.</b>

12:23.570 --> 12:24.820
<b>What?!</b>

12:27.120 --> 12:28.990
<b>We're starting to descend!</b>

12:29.580 --> 12:32.750
<b>Fall in the Sea of Darkness
and you'll be done for! Be careful!</b>

12:32.830 --> 12:33.710
<b>Got it!</b>

12:40.670 --> 12:42.050
<b>Now! Get away!</b>

13:07.450 --> 13:09.160
<b>Whoa.</b>

13:10.620 --> 13:13.700
<b>It looks like we gained
quite some distance.</b>

13:13.790 --> 13:16.620
<b>How much farther is the castle?</b>

13:16.710 --> 13:18.710
<b>Half a day's walk.</b>

13:19.460 --> 13:20.790
<b>Half a day, huh.</b>

13:21.380 --> 13:23.670
<b>Let's fly the rest of the way.</b>

13:23.760 --> 13:28.840
<b>If we run out of stamina,
we can eat one of those Revive Bugs.</b>

13:31.060 --> 13:33.640
<b>I don't really like bugs.</b>

13:33.720 --> 13:34.680
<b>Same here.</b>

13:36.770 --> 13:39.150
<b>Man, I'm thirsty.</b>

13:39.770 --> 13:42.360
<b>Come to think of it, before we came here,</b>

13:43.070 --> 13:46.860
<b><i>Piccolo mentioned</i>
<i>the Demon Realm's Dragon Balls.</i></b>

13:47.490 --> 13:50.070
<b>Do they really have Dragon Balls here?</b>

13:50.160 --> 13:52.240
<b>Yes. Of course.</b>

13:52.330 --> 13:54.660
<b>Huh! Seriously?!</b>

13:54.750 --> 13:58.170
<b>You could say the Demon Realm
Dragon Balls are the originals.</b>

13:58.250 --> 14:02.000
<b>Wow! How do you find them here?</b>

14:02.590 --> 14:03.590
<b>Find them?</b>

14:04.630 --> 14:07.880
<b>There's no need to find them.
Everyone knows where they are.</b>

14:08.470 --> 14:10.760
<b>You know? What do you mean?</b>

14:11.350 --> 14:14.060
<b>There are three Demon Worlds
in the Demon Realm.</b>

14:14.140 --> 14:15.470
<b>This is the Third Demon World.</b>

14:16.560 --> 14:21.400
<b><i>Each Demon World has a Dragon Ball</i>
<i>in a specific location.</i></b>

14:21.480 --> 14:23.940
<b><i>Warriors called Tamagamis guard them.</i></b>

14:24.020 --> 14:25.530
<b>Tamagamis?</b>

14:25.610 --> 14:29.070
<b>So you need to steal the Balls
from the Tamagamis?</b>

14:29.820 --> 14:32.660
<b>Yes. But that's no easy feat.</b>

14:32.740 --> 14:34.790
<b>The Tamagamis are incredibly strong.</b>

14:34.870 --> 14:37.000
<b>They're really that strong?</b>

14:37.080 --> 14:38.330
<b>Yes.</b>

14:38.410 --> 14:41.330
<b>You must fight and defeat them
to obtain the Balls.</b>

14:41.920 --> 14:45.500
<b>I take it one must do that three times
to have a wish granted.</b>

14:46.090 --> 14:47.760
<b>Is that correct?</b>

14:47.840 --> 14:48.920
<b>Exactly.</b>

14:49.010 --> 14:52.720
<b>So you only need to gather
three Dragon Balls in this place!</b>

14:52.800 --> 14:55.470
<b>That sounds super duper fun!</b>

14:55.560 --> 14:58.310
<b>Whoa! I wanna gather the Dragon Balls!</b>

14:58.810 --> 15:00.100
<b>You can't.</b>

15:00.190 --> 15:06.070
<b>As far as I know, no one has ever gathered
all three and had a wish granted.</b>

15:06.150 --> 15:09.490
<b>That just makes me wanna try it more!</b>

15:09.570 --> 15:11.200
<b>You can't, Goku-san.</b>

15:13.030 --> 15:15.490
<b>Rescuing Dende-san comes first.</b>

15:20.410 --> 15:23.960
<b>Hey, is the Tamagami far from here?</b>

15:24.590 --> 15:27.920
<b>Remember the Warp-sama where we arrived?
It's in the opposite direction.</b>

15:28.510 --> 15:31.180
<b><i>The opposite?! That's too far.</i></b>

15:31.260 --> 15:33.680
<b>Maybe so, but…</b>

15:33.760 --> 15:38.520
<b>if we get the Dragon Balls and
make a wish while goin' to rescue Dende,</b>

15:38.600 --> 15:41.140
<b>we can become grownup again!</b>

15:41.230 --> 15:43.270
<b>That's true, but…</b>

15:43.850 --> 15:45.150
<b>I see.</b>

15:45.650 --> 15:47.360
<b>That might be worth pursuing.</b>

15:47.440 --> 15:49.190
<b>Now you're agreeing with this?</b>

15:49.280 --> 15:50.110
<b>What happens</b>

15:50.190 --> 15:55.160
<b><i>if that Dende fellow is killed</i>
<i>or you can't find him?</i></b>

15:55.910 --> 16:00.160
<b>If you use the Demon Realm Dragon Balls
to make a wish, you can rescue Dende,</b>

16:00.250 --> 16:03.920
<b>and you can return to normal
with the Earth Dragon Balls.</b>

16:04.000 --> 16:06.290
<b>Right?! Let's do it!</b>

16:06.380 --> 16:08.000
<b>Woo hoo!</b>

16:14.590 --> 16:15.970
<b>Very well.</b>

16:16.050 --> 16:18.180
<b>Hooray!</b>

16:23.940 --> 16:28.110
<b>I can see the next town!
We can finally get somethin' to drink!</b>

16:28.190 --> 16:29.650
<b>Plus I'm hungry!</b>

16:29.730 --> 16:31.820
<b>It would be nice to rest.</b>

16:32.530 --> 16:34.530
<b>Oh! Water!</b>

16:37.070 --> 16:38.660
<b>Oh, Goku-san!</b>

16:42.580 --> 16:45.620
<b>Is the water here safe to drink?</b>

16:45.710 --> 16:46.880
<b>I think so.</b>

16:59.470 --> 17:00.930
<b>What's going on?</b>

17:01.020 --> 17:02.270
<b>I don't know.</b>

17:06.230 --> 17:08.020
<b>Tch! It's the Gendarmerie.</b>

17:08.110 --> 17:09.110
<b>The Gendarmerie?</b>

17:09.730 --> 17:11.730
<b>The Supreme Demon King's military police.</b>

17:12.360 --> 17:15.610
<b>We will now begin gathering
this year's offerings!</b>

17:19.700 --> 17:20.910
<b>Silence!</b>

17:22.660 --> 17:24.960
<b>As you well know,</b>

17:25.040 --> 17:29.710
<b>with Supreme Demon King Dabura's death,
Gomah-sama has become Supreme Demon King!</b>

17:29.790 --> 17:34.300
<b>King Gomah feels that the demand for
offerings has been too lenient.</b>

17:34.880 --> 17:37.050
<b>As such, starting now…</b>

17:37.760 --> 17:39.930
<b>offerings will be three gold coins!</b>

17:40.010 --> 17:41.600
<b>Three coins?!</b>

17:41.680 --> 17:42.770
<b>That's impossible!</b>

17:42.850 --> 17:48.350
<b>Anyone who fails to pay will forfeit
3 years of their lives per coin!</b>

17:48.440 --> 17:54.030
<b>So anyone who can't pay a single coin
will pay nine years! Got it?!</b>

17:54.110 --> 17:55.690
<b>Th-That's too cruel!</b>

17:58.950 --> 18:02.410
<b>I'm sure you're aware that
there's no point in running!</b>

18:03.040 --> 18:07.000
<b>With the Magic Collars on your necks,
we will find you!</b>

18:09.080 --> 18:09.960
<b>They got me!</b>

18:15.670 --> 18:20.640
<b>Fleeing will cost you another ten years!
Is that clear?!</b>

18:20.720 --> 18:23.220
<b>That's horrible. They're out of control.</b>

18:23.310 --> 18:24.600
<b>Can you believe those guys?</b>

18:25.180 --> 18:27.060
<b>Come on! Cough them up!</b>

18:28.600 --> 18:29.980
<b>Good! Next!</b>

18:32.820 --> 18:34.610
<b>Wait. This isn't enough.</b>

18:34.690 --> 18:36.990
<b>This is all that I have.</b>

18:37.570 --> 18:38.570
<b>Take him.</b>

18:40.610 --> 18:42.370
<b>Come on!</b>

18:57.260 --> 18:59.970
<b>Tch. Can you believe these guys?</b>

19:01.220 --> 19:03.300
<b>Should I beat the heck outta them?</b>

19:03.390 --> 19:05.220
<b>Don't. It'll cause more trouble.</b>

19:05.310 --> 19:08.480
<b>Please! I'll pay next time! Forgive me!</b>

19:08.560 --> 19:12.020
<b>If I lose nine years
of my life I might die!</b>

19:12.100 --> 19:13.690
<b>Not happening!</b>

19:13.770 --> 19:14.940
<b>Do it!</b>

19:16.070 --> 19:18.490
<b>Hey! Stop picking on an old man!</b>

19:18.570 --> 19:20.200
<b>Why you…! Why you…!</b>

19:20.280 --> 19:21.990
<b>Hey! Stop struggling, old man!</b>

19:22.070 --> 19:23.200
<b>Hey!</b>

19:24.870 --> 19:27.080
<b>Hey creeps, that's enough!</b>

19:33.290 --> 19:34.380
<b>Who the heck are you?</b>

19:36.710 --> 19:41.090
<b>Ta-da! Taste this hand-made Wasabi Bomb!</b>

19:41.180 --> 19:43.010
<b>Take this!</b>

19:52.770 --> 19:54.060
<b>Whoops!</b>

19:54.150 --> 19:55.770
<b>G-Get them!</b>

19:55.860 --> 19:57.230
<b>-Get back here!
-Why you…!</b>

20:01.030 --> 20:02.780
<b>Let go! You big brute!</b>

20:07.280 --> 20:09.040
<b>-Move!
-Out of the way!</b>

20:13.670 --> 20:16.080
<b>Enough! Stop struggling!</b>

20:18.300 --> 20:20.550
<b>You little…!</b>

20:38.690 --> 20:40.070
<b>Get outta here!</b>

20:40.690 --> 20:42.030
<b>Hey!</b>

20:42.110 --> 20:43.610
<b>Who the heck are you?!</b>

21:50.260 --> 21:52.260
<b>Whoops, I went too far.</b>

21:52.850 --> 21:55.730
<b>Y-You! Who are you?!</b>

21:56.980 --> 21:59.190
<b>This way, quickly!</b>

22:00.520 --> 22:01.570
<b>Hurry!</b>

22:02.230 --> 22:04.360
<b>-Hey!
-Stop!</b>

22:10.950 --> 22:13.700
<b>And now you've become a fugitive.</b>

22:13.790 --> 22:17.750
<b>Don't blame me.
I couldn't let them do that.</b>

22:17.830 --> 22:18.670
<b>Good point.</b>

22:18.750 --> 22:20.250
<b>Who are you?!</b>

22:24.800 --> 22:26.720
<b>Oh! It's you!</b>

22:42.730 --> 22:44.650
<b><i>Holding out my hand</i></b>

22:46.400 --> 22:48.320
<b><i>Up to the sky</i></b>

22:50.200 --> 22:52.740
<b><i>The moment is ours</i></b>

22:53.370 --> 22:56.790
<b><i>Make a miracle happen</i></b>

22:56.870 --> 23:03.040
<b><i>Like a bird with open wings we fly</i></b>

23:03.130 --> 23:06.880
<b><i>Picking up</i></b>

23:06.960 --> 23:10.260
<b><i>Those pieces of hope</i></b>

23:11.300 --> 23:17.220
<b><i>There's no giving up</i></b>

23:17.810 --> 23:22.060
<b><i>Go as far as we can</i></b>

23:22.150 --> 23:25.690
<b><i>I got you by my side</i></b>

23:25.770 --> 23:28.780
<b><i>Run, run, run</i></b>

23:28.860 --> 23:32.360
<b><i>Over the mountain we go</i></b>

23:32.450 --> 23:36.200
<b><i>I hear it always</i>
<i>Your voice in my heart</i></b>

23:36.280 --> 23:40.620
<b><i>"You know that we're never alone"</i></b>

23:41.670 --> 23:46.590
<b>PANZY</b>
