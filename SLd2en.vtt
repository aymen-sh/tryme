WEBVTT

00:06.780 --> 00:08.030
Arise.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.400
Good.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.060
How long has it been?

01:57.060 --> 01:58.810
About three hours.

01:59.270 --> 02:02.520
That's roughly three days 
on the other side, right?

02:02.980 --> 02:05.900
It's supposed to be particularly 
harsh inside of a red gate.

02:07.320 --> 02:11.070
Then that Sung Jinwoo guy is probably dead.

02:11.530 --> 02:13.100
What a waste of time.

02:15.330 --> 02:21.040
No... Hang on. Sung Jinwoo isn't 
with the White Tiger Guild, is he?

02:21.540 --> 02:26.480
Then why exactly is he with your strike team?

02:28.960 --> 02:31.300
He's an acquaintance of mine.

02:31.300 --> 02:34.970
He wanted to observe a C-Rank raid, 
so I brought him in.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.390
Oh, is that all?

02:42.480 --> 02:44.860
You really think I'm that gullible?!

02:44.860 --> 02:47.780
What have you dug up this time?

02:47.780 --> 02:51.900
You've always had a knack for 
sniffing out where interesting new—

02:53.490 --> 02:54.570
Hwang Dongsoo.

02:55.710 --> 02:57.540
Take your hands off him!

02:57.880 --> 02:59.910
You really wanna start giving me orders?

02:59.910 --> 03:03.540
You think you're a big fish 
in this tiny pond of a country?

03:04.160 --> 03:05.430
Say that again.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.130
<i>This isn't good!</i>

03:10.130 --> 03:14.380
<i>If they're not stopped soon, 
we'll have an S-Rank battle on our hands!</i>

03:14.720 --> 03:16.400
You want some?

03:32.130 --> 03:34.990
It was too cold... No...

03:35.640 --> 03:38.950
If we had our gear, we could've won...

03:40.950 --> 03:43.870
<i>I thought it was strange none 
of the ice bears had come out!</i>

03:44.480 --> 03:47.080
<i>It can't be... Did those E-Ranks do this?!</i>

03:47.820 --> 03:50.670
<i>No way! They couldn't be strong enough!</i>

03:53.130 --> 03:55.590
Wait, the Ice Slayers...

03:55.590 --> 03:56.510
They're here, too!

03:56.930 --> 03:58.140
Shit!

04:03.640 --> 04:05.230
Not too shabby.

04:07.230 --> 04:13.370
Thanks to you both holding back at the 
last second, my arms remain intact.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.330
I'm not sure what your interest 
is in him, Hunter Hwang,

04:19.330 --> 04:23.910
but I personally re-evaluated him 
two months ago.

04:24.540 --> 04:27.880
I can guarantee you 
that Hunter Sung is E-Rank.

04:28.230 --> 04:32.320
The Surveillance Team has declared 
Hunter Hwang Dongsuk's cause of death

04:32.320 --> 04:34.370
as being KIA in battle against a magic beast.

04:35.380 --> 04:38.340
That's just the story for the public, though.

04:38.340 --> 04:40.680
And an obviously fake one, too.

04:40.680 --> 04:44.800
The real killer's gotta be that rich 
little turd from Yoojin Construction.

04:46.190 --> 04:49.560
If you think that, then why 
are you after Hunter Sung?

04:50.850 --> 04:52.840
Ain't it obvious?

04:52.840 --> 04:55.110
It's just an excuse.

04:55.570 --> 04:57.570
An excuse to kill the guy.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.340
He's a lucky bastard.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.360
Hunter Hwang!

05:10.830 --> 05:15.180
<i>Nobody understands 
Hunter Sung's power like I do.</i>

05:15.870 --> 05:18.210
<i>I know for a fact that 
he will survive, and return.</i>

05:20.890 --> 05:23.890
And so, then I was out of money to buy gear!

05:24.670 --> 05:27.850
I'm telling you! I was off by a factor of ten!

05:27.850 --> 05:29.810
It was that expensive!

05:28.560 --> 05:33.040
<i>What the hell are weaklings 
like you doing alive?!</i>

05:29.810 --> 05:31.550
Really?

05:33.040 --> 05:35.670
So much that I had to take 
all of the weapons and—

05:33.040 --> 05:36.280
<i>You've got cold-weather gear, 
blankets, tents, and even food!</i>

05:37.390 --> 05:40.490
<i>Oh, is that what happened?</i>

05:41.310 --> 05:42.620
Hey!

05:43.530 --> 05:44.920
Hunter Kim?

05:44.920 --> 05:47.370
My entire strike team was wiped out!

05:48.000 --> 05:50.460
Because they didn't have gear and supplies!

05:50.460 --> 05:51.640
That's...

05:51.640 --> 05:53.710
Who hid all of this?!

05:53.710 --> 05:57.590
Who was the one that hoarded all this 
equipment and got my friends killed?!

05:58.420 --> 06:00.650
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

06:00.650 --> 06:01.920
H-Heejin...

06:01.920 --> 06:04.510
<i>You knew all along, didn't you?</i>

06:04.510 --> 06:06.470
<i>That's why you went with them.</i>

06:06.820 --> 06:09.670
Any collaborators will be 
considered guilty, too!

06:10.170 --> 06:12.400
I want a confession by the count of three!

06:13.300 --> 06:14.860
One!

06:15.250 --> 06:16.120
Two!

06:16.120 --> 06:17.820
<i>I know who did it...</i>

06:18.730 --> 06:19.840
<i>Sung Jinwoo!</i>

06:19.840 --> 06:21.190
Three!

06:28.930 --> 06:31.610
You're blaming your friends' 
death on who, exactly?

06:31.610 --> 06:32.620
Mister!

06:32.620 --> 06:34.020
Captain!

06:34.020 --> 06:36.570
And you dragged in a bunch of extra trouble...

06:36.950 --> 06:41.670
Drop the Stealth. Your aura's way 
too strong to not notice, anyway.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.930
Are those ice elves?!

06:45.930 --> 06:47.770
And so many of them!

06:48.700 --> 06:49.980
That guy must be the boss.

06:54.590 --> 06:56.480
Imagine my surprise...

06:56.830 --> 06:59.180
Finding out that some of you scum 
know what you're doing.

06:59.530 --> 07:00.930
Excuse me?

07:00.930 --> 07:04.460
Are you calling us scum when...

07:09.390 --> 07:11.440
...You actually understand our language?

07:12.580 --> 07:13.780
<i>Actually... Why do I?</i>

07:13.780 --> 07:17.080
You can speak the magic beasts' language?

07:17.540 --> 07:19.570
<i>I guess I can thank the system for that.</i>

07:19.920 --> 07:22.930
If you can understand me, 
then I'll make this simple.

07:22.930 --> 07:25.140
My friend here has informed me...

07:26.100 --> 07:29.540
that one of the humans 
we've encountered is strong.

07:29.540 --> 07:31.930
He also wants to fight you—

07:39.190 --> 07:40.090
And?

07:42.790 --> 07:44.390
Interesting.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.910
<i>He's not gonna go down easy.</i>

07:53.950 --> 07:56.040
This keeps getting better.

07:56.480 --> 08:02.550
Tell me, you're not human, 
so why are you pretending to be one?

08:04.800 --> 08:08.470
Oh, I suppose you aren't aware?

08:08.470 --> 08:13.170
We can hear a voice. 
It tells us to kill humans.

08:13.170 --> 08:16.440
But we don't hear it when it comes to you.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.490
<i>A voice...?</i>

08:19.330 --> 08:22.190
<i>Could it be similar to the system directives?</i>

08:22.190 --> 08:27.450
<i>The voice not directing them against me 
could stem from me being the Player.</i>

08:27.450 --> 08:32.860
There's no need for us to fight. 
Let's handle this the sensible way.

08:32.860 --> 08:37.850
Hand over those humans behind you, 
and we'll leave you alone.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.910
How about it? What do you say to our offer?

08:41.630 --> 08:43.710
Who exactly are you?

08:44.050 --> 08:46.250
Why are you fighting humans, anyway?

08:46.720 --> 08:48.290
We are—

08:50.240 --> 08:56.480
Hand over those humans behind you, 
and we'll leave you alone.

08:56.990 --> 08:58.580
<i>What was that just now?</i>

08:58.580 --> 09:01.570
How about it? What do you say to our offer?

09:01.570 --> 09:03.400
I'm sure you'll agree.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.400
No, I won't.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.910
You intend on making enemies of us?

09:11.910 --> 09:15.150
As you can see, the numbers are on our side.

09:16.330 --> 09:17.750
Are you sure about that?

09:25.920 --> 09:27.550
Wh-What is this?

09:27.550 --> 09:30.300
M-Monsters! A bunch of monsters just appeared!

09:30.300 --> 09:33.680
Black soldiers and black ice bears?!

09:33.680 --> 09:34.790
Are these all...

09:34.790 --> 09:36.980
Hunter Sung, did you do this?!

09:37.750 --> 09:40.250
What a waste of time.

09:40.250 --> 09:43.530
A waste? You really think so?

10:00.530 --> 10:04.510
Hurry! We won't be any help 
in a fight like this!

10:12.430 --> 10:14.410
<i>I can see why he was so confident.</i>

10:14.810 --> 10:18.000
<i>My summons might be immortal, but 
their regeneration costs magic power.</i>

10:18.980 --> 10:21.270
<i>I have a lot, but it'll run out eventually.</i>

10:21.770 --> 10:23.150
<i>Then there's the boss.</i>

10:23.720 --> 10:25.610
<i>He's pretty clearly stronger than me.</i>

10:32.500 --> 10:35.330
<i>Even if I fought alongside Igris, 
it'd probably be tough.</i>

10:36.000 --> 10:37.950
<i>Regular soldiers aren't going to cut it.</i>

10:38.720 --> 10:41.370
<i>I need a stronger fighting force.</i>

10:41.370 --> 10:43.330
My name is Barca.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.670
What's yours?

10:47.800 --> 10:49.120
Sung Jinwoo.

11:15.310 --> 11:18.490
I haven't enjoyed a fight like this in ages.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.430
What hit me...?

11:40.190 --> 11:42.430
Sung Jinwoo!

11:45.030 --> 11:47.740
<i>I was able to buy some time 
with the magic soldiers.</i>

11:48.230 --> 11:49.100
<i>That just leaves...</i>

11:49.750 --> 11:52.470
Is that the best your men can do?!

11:54.110 --> 11:56.450
Sung Jinwoo!

11:56.450 --> 11:58.080
Die!

11:58.080 --> 12:00.390
The humans have abandoned you, too!

12:06.160 --> 12:10.380
Worthless! Hiding won't save you!

12:18.100 --> 12:20.390
Sung Jinwoo!

12:20.390 --> 12:22.050
Die!

12:22.050 --> 12:25.290
Kim Chul. I figured that was your next move.

12:30.680 --> 12:31.690
Worthless!

12:36.250 --> 12:38.700
Sung Jinwoo... You bastard!

12:39.720 --> 12:45.120
You knew... this would happen...?

12:45.460 --> 12:47.150
Damn it all!

12:49.340 --> 12:50.090
Arise.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.630
Hiding won't save you!

13:10.250 --> 13:11.230
Iron.

13:11.930 --> 13:14.840
From now on, your name is Iron.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.950
Isn't that interesting?!

13:24.950 --> 13:27.230
I'll cut you to pieces first!

13:35.230 --> 13:38.120
Not very agile, are you?

13:41.460 --> 13:46.870
Heejin, are hunter battles always like this?

13:47.300 --> 13:51.060
Do you really think I could 
be a hunter if they were?

13:51.460 --> 13:53.500
I've never seen anything like this before.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.230
This is really happening, isn't it...?

13:59.340 --> 14:01.910
This one isn't satisfying enough.

14:02.280 --> 14:07.050
You and the knight need to face me, too!

14:07.050 --> 14:08.540
Is that right?

14:20.180 --> 14:23.680
You get to die first!

14:33.400 --> 14:35.770
<i>He was able to avoid a 
fatal hit amidst all that?</i>

14:37.390 --> 14:40.890
You're taking me too lightly, aren't you?

14:40.890 --> 14:42.820
You're definitely strong.

14:43.330 --> 14:46.370
But what about your soldiers?

14:53.720 --> 14:58.340
I doubt your rabble will 
amount to much without you!

15:00.100 --> 15:02.730
Throwing away your weapon?! Fool!

15:12.140 --> 15:12.980
Iron!

15:32.220 --> 15:35.500
How dare you?!

15:36.030 --> 15:39.610
I'll slaughter you all!

15:41.260 --> 15:43.430
It's already over.

15:43.430 --> 15:48.200
Don't give me that! 
It's over when I say it's over!

15:58.530 --> 15:59.650
Like I said...

16:02.020 --> 16:04.060
It's already over.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.420
Looks like I managed to beat him.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.540
Hey! Enough already!

16:19.130 --> 16:21.000
Show some restraint.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.920
I hope this doesn't become a problem.

16:37.090 --> 16:39.870
Is it over?

16:39.870 --> 16:41.020
Yes.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.640
We should get going now.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.110
Back out of the gate.

16:52.310 --> 16:55.910
Yes! We get to go home!

16:55.910 --> 16:57.730
What a relief...

16:57.730 --> 16:59.010
It felt like forever!

16:59.010 --> 17:00.450
Finally.

17:02.060 --> 17:03.530
But first...

17:07.600 --> 17:11.970
At this point, I believe it's 
been a week inside the gate.

17:11.970 --> 17:16.370
The rest of us can stay on standby. 
You should head home, President.

17:16.930 --> 17:20.770
I'm not going to do that when 
we've got guild members inside.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.490
I'll wait until morning.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.900
Those are people... They're coming out!

17:27.970 --> 17:29.360
<i>Hunter Kim!</i>

17:29.740 --> 17:32.350
<i>I knew you could pull it off!</i>

17:33.830 --> 17:34.830
President Baek!

17:36.290 --> 17:41.500
Hunter Park... Hunter Go. 
I'm glad to see you two are all right.

17:41.890 --> 17:43.440
What about the others?

17:52.260 --> 17:53.660
Hunter Sung!

17:54.480 --> 17:56.060
<i>I knew it!</i>

18:01.030 --> 18:03.230
The gate... closed?

18:03.840 --> 18:06.620
Where are the others? Where's Hunter Kim?

18:07.030 --> 18:08.190
Well...

18:09.240 --> 18:12.170
The lower ranks are 
the only ones who returned?

18:12.170 --> 18:14.620
<i>What in the world went on in there...?</i>

18:14.620 --> 18:16.940
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

18:16.940 --> 18:18.660
Oh, r-right.

18:18.660 --> 18:19.940
Hang on a second.

18:19.940 --> 18:22.310
I'd like to ask you some questions.

18:23.190 --> 18:25.360
I'm exhausted.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.690
Save the questions 
for someone from your guild.

18:29.340 --> 18:33.490
<i>That wasn't me asking for a favor. 
It was an order, or failing that, a threat.</i>

18:34.230 --> 18:38.810
Six members of my guild have gone missing.

18:39.150 --> 18:43.480
And it falls to me to find out 
what happened to them.

18:44.840 --> 18:49.830
That might be true, but I saved 
the two surviving members.

18:49.830 --> 18:54.020
So doesn't it fall to you 
to show me the proper gratitude first?

19:00.050 --> 19:03.620
You'll have to excuse me. 
You are absolutely right.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.450
I apologize.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.620
Hunter Park...

19:11.620 --> 19:12.680
Yes?

19:12.680 --> 19:17.280
Who in the world was that? 
Not exactly friendly, is he?

19:17.280 --> 19:22.600
Well... After he beat the boss, 
his mood turned sour all of a sudden.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.360
Most likely from exhaustion.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.280
He's not a bad guy.

19:30.540 --> 19:31.820
Manager Ahn...

19:31.820 --> 19:35.910
You need to bring him to our guild, 
no matter what it takes.

19:35.910 --> 19:37.280
Y-Yes, sir!

19:39.350 --> 19:42.520
<i>Looks like I was right all along.</i>

19:45.590 --> 19:46.710
Good work today.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.090
Have a safe trip home.

19:50.170 --> 19:52.210
Um... Jinwoo?

19:53.040 --> 19:54.130
Just "Jinwoo"?

19:54.130 --> 19:56.780
Thank you for today.

19:57.450 --> 20:02.100
I'll be counting on you tomorrow... 
or whenever the next time is.

20:04.940 --> 20:06.230
Sure...

20:08.840 --> 20:12.920
<i>Come to think of it, it hasn't 
even been a whole day out here.</i>

20:13.880 --> 20:17.180
<i>This was the only thing of note 
I managed to earn.</i>

20:18.490 --> 20:21.480
<i>He must've been too high a level...</i>

20:29.880 --> 20:32.590
<i>I wasn't able to extract him, 
even after three tries.</i>

20:30.750 --> 20:31.830
Damn it!

20:34.430 --> 20:36.800
A lot of effort for not much gain.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.010
<i>Although...</i>

20:43.640 --> 20:47.650
<i>That's the third time.</i>

20:51.670 --> 20:55.160
Jinwoo? I'm gonna eat without you!

20:55.160 --> 20:56.810
I'm on the way.

20:58.940 --> 21:00.740
Good morning!

21:01.890 --> 21:03.910
You're wearing... that?

21:03.910 --> 21:06.450
Yep! Let's get moving.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.420
All right, then.

21:09.420 --> 21:11.600
We'll be picking someone up along the way.

21:14.320 --> 21:16.470
Good morning, Captain!

21:16.470 --> 21:19.040
Oh... Good morning.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.820
Sorry about needing to get 
picked up like this, Jinwoo.

21:22.850 --> 21:23.850
<i>Just Jinwoo?!</i>

21:24.450 --> 21:26.140
Did you get any sleep after all that?

21:26.140 --> 21:28.090
Not even a little!

21:28.090 --> 21:30.690
Well, considering how late it was 
when you got home...

21:31.100 --> 21:32.520
<i>She got home in the morning...</i>

21:31.710 --> 21:32.520
Good point.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.190
Jinwoo, did you—

21:32.520 --> 21:34.190
<i>and didn't sleep at all?!</i>

21:34.190 --> 21:37.280
<i>Is that what's going on here?!</i>

21:37.780 --> 21:39.770
Get some sleep now. 
I'll let you know when it's time.

21:38.720 --> 21:41.310
Uh, Boss...?

21:39.770 --> 21:41.310
Oh, thank you.

21:42.100 --> 21:45.450
You know that Miss Han... is underage, right?

21:46.540 --> 21:47.580
And?

21:52.090 --> 21:54.910
Nothing. Never mind.

21:57.090 --> 21:58.980
Let's get to work so we can finish fast.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.510
Right, Jinwoo!

22:00.930 --> 22:02.260
Right...
