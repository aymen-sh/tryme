00:15.340 --> 00:17.720
<b><i>Dragon Balls.</i></b>

00:17.800 --> 00:21.270
<b><i>When seven of these</i>
<i>mysterious balls are gathered</i></b>

00:21.350 --> 00:27.610
<b><i>and the password recited,</i>
<i>a dragon called Shenron appears.</i></b>

00:28.940 --> 00:34.240
<b><i>Shenron will grant</i>
<i>whatever wish is requested.</i></b>

00:35.240 --> 00:38.320
<b><i>This man, Son Goku, may appear gentle,</i></b>

00:38.410 --> 00:44.910
<b><i>but is the most powerful warrior</i>
<i>who possesses unworldly strength.</i></b>

00:46.580 --> 00:49.290
<b><i>He lived in the mountains as a child,</i></b>

00:49.380 --> 00:52.260
<b><i>searched for the Dragon Balls,</i>
<i>met many friends,</i></b>

00:52.340 --> 00:56.930
<b><i>and went on adventures with them</i>
<i>as he grew into adulthood.</i></b>

00:57.720 --> 01:03.810
<b><i>One day, a vicious battle race</i>
<i>called Saiyans arrived.</i></b>

01:04.430 --> 01:07.940
<b><i>Goku learned that he, too, was a Saiyan</i></b>

01:08.020 --> 01:12.110
<b><i>who was sent to Earth as an infant.</i></b>

01:15.150 --> 01:21.830
<b><i>Saiyans maintain a youthful body</i>
<i>for much of their lives.</i></b>

01:21.910 --> 01:26.870
<b><i>Goku continues to face terrifying enemies</i>
<i>and grows through his battles.</i></b>

01:27.460 --> 01:30.290
<b><i>And together, with his former rivals,</i></b>

01:30.380 --> 01:35.510
<b><i>he continues</i>
<i>to protect the Earth from evil.</i></b>

01:42.760 --> 01:48.230
<b><i>Now, the Earth faces a new threat…</i></b>

01:48.310 --> 01:53.150
<b>CONSPIRACY</b>

01:55.690 --> 02:00.410
<b>Original Work, Story & Character Design
Akira Toriyama (Shueisha "Jump comics”)</b>

02:41.530 --> 02:45.030
<b>Curse that Babidi!
That crafty little scoundrel!</b>

02:45.120 --> 02:48.000
<b>He actually used King Dabura.</b>

02:48.870 --> 02:55.250
<b>I can't believe the Supreme Demon King
would fall prey to Babidi's magic.</b>

02:55.880 --> 02:57.880
<b>How disgraceful.</b>

03:05.140 --> 03:07.850
<b><i>Dabura… Is he strong or somethin'?</i></b>

03:08.430 --> 03:12.980
<b><i>Of course he is.</i>
<i>He's the king of the dark demon world.</i></b>

03:13.060 --> 03:17.940
<b><i>K-King of the demon world?!</i>
<i>Such a world exists?</i></b>

03:18.740 --> 03:19.990
<b><i>It does.</i></b>

03:20.490 --> 03:25.370
<b>Look at that, Degesu.
Isn't that your older brother?</b>

03:27.450 --> 03:30.080
<b>Still the nosey upstart as always.</b>

03:30.710 --> 03:33.290
<b>He thinks so highly of himself
as Supreme Kai.</b>

03:33.370 --> 03:37.380
<b>He's not helping the mortals, is he?</b>

03:37.460 --> 03:40.300
<b>Let's look a little further ahead.</b>

03:47.810 --> 03:49.270
<b><i>You idiot…!</i></b>

03:53.980 --> 03:55.400
<b>What in the world?!</b>

03:55.940 --> 04:00.240
<b>How can such powerful beings exist
in the outside world?!</b>

04:00.320 --> 04:02.490
<b>Do you think they could be Majin?</b>

04:10.500 --> 04:13.460
<b>They can't be. Look.</b>

04:13.540 --> 04:15.290
<b>Their ears are round.</b>

04:16.080 --> 04:17.920
<b>But they're flying.</b>

04:22.550 --> 04:25.590
<b>They fire light from their hands…</b>

04:26.220 --> 04:28.890
<b>and seem to be able to use magic.</b>

04:35.350 --> 04:38.730
<b><i>At last, Majin Buu awakens again!</i></b>

04:45.700 --> 04:47.570
<b><i>Buu!</i></b>

04:50.080 --> 04:52.290
<b>And now Buu is back!</b>

04:56.670 --> 04:58.080
<b>Curse that Babidi.</b>

04:58.170 --> 05:00.420
<b>He wants to rule
not only the outside world,</b>

05:00.500 --> 05:02.630
<b>but the Demon Realm and all worlds, too.</b>

05:04.670 --> 05:07.550
<b><i>I think I'll eat you.</i></b>

05:19.400 --> 05:22.980
<b>Look! Dabura was defeated!</b>

05:23.070 --> 05:24.530
<b>And so easily!</b>

05:26.360 --> 05:30.660
<b>And now you're
the king of the Demon Realm.</b>

05:36.460 --> 05:40.210
<b>No, no, no, no, no!
We can't be celebrating!</b>

05:40.290 --> 05:44.800
<b>The next target that Babidi is going to
use Majin Buu on is us!</b>

05:45.470 --> 05:47.130
<b>You're right.</b>

05:49.930 --> 05:53.810
<b>Lord Gomah! Isn't that a Namek?</b>

05:53.890 --> 05:55.140
<b>Huh?</b>

05:55.810 --> 05:58.310
<b>Now that you mention it…</b>

06:16.080 --> 06:19.080
<b>They did it! They defeated Buu!</b>

06:19.170 --> 06:20.750
<b>We'll see.</b>

06:29.010 --> 06:32.260
<b>I knew he was still alive.</b>

06:34.600 --> 06:37.350
<b>Hey! The sky went dark!</b>

06:37.430 --> 06:39.390
<b>What could be happening?</b>

06:39.480 --> 06:40.560
<b>Hmm?</b>

06:40.650 --> 06:42.560
<b>Could it be…?</b>

06:45.270 --> 06:48.150
<b>Found it! This is the reason!</b>

06:48.240 --> 06:52.200
<b>Look! Th-Those are Dragon Balls!</b>

06:52.280 --> 06:53.700
<b>Dragon Balls?!</b>

06:53.780 --> 06:57.750
<b>See?!
Those ball-like things they have there!</b>

06:57.830 --> 07:01.710
<b>I'm sure of it!
They're smaller, but they're Dragon Balls!</b>

07:01.790 --> 07:04.250
<b>One… Two… Three… Four… There are seven.</b>

07:04.840 --> 07:08.510
<b>I can't believe it!
Theirs are composed of seven Balls!</b>

07:09.340 --> 07:14.220
<b>But this looks quite different
from the Porunga I've read about.</b>

07:14.300 --> 07:16.510
<b>Let's rewind a bit!</b>

07:18.980 --> 07:20.810
<b><i>Rise, Shenron!</i></b>

07:22.350 --> 07:25.940
<b>So they seem to call it Shenron
instead of Porunga.</b>

07:26.020 --> 07:32.320
<b>From the way they seem to be used to this,
their Dragon Balls must be easy to gather.</b>

07:34.280 --> 07:37.580
<b><i>Now speak your wish.</i></b>

07:38.080 --> 07:42.080
<b><i>I shall grant any three wishes you have.</i></b>

07:43.750 --> 07:44.920
<b>Three?!</b>

07:45.000 --> 07:48.500
<b>On Earth they get three whole wishes?!</b>

07:48.590 --> 07:51.090
<b>This is a huge discovery!</b>

07:52.220 --> 07:55.470
<b>Hold on. What happened with Buu?</b>

07:56.050 --> 07:59.220
<b><i>I don't need you anymore!</i></b>

08:01.270 --> 08:04.650
<b><i>Die! Dummy!</i></b>

08:07.440 --> 08:11.570
<b>He killed him?!
Buu kill his own master Babidi!</b>

08:13.490 --> 08:15.410
<b>This is glorious!</b>

08:25.330 --> 08:27.710
<b>We lost him?! Where is he?!</b>

08:30.630 --> 08:33.670
<b>Look at that! Another Namek!</b>

08:33.760 --> 08:36.090
<b>Yeah! There's no mistake!</b>

08:36.180 --> 08:39.600
<b>No wonder we couldn't find any
despite searching.</b>

08:39.680 --> 08:41.930
<b>They escaped to the outside world.</b>

08:42.770 --> 08:44.390
<b>Buu's changed!</b>

08:47.900 --> 08:50.320
<b>It looks like Buu has increased in power.</b>

08:52.820 --> 08:55.450
<b><i>Death Missile Chain!</i></b>

09:02.330 --> 09:06.920
<b>What is with these
unbelievably powerful beings?!</b>

09:24.350 --> 09:26.100
<b><i>H-Here we go!</i></b>

09:36.950 --> 09:38.240
<b><i>See you!</i></b>

10:06.270 --> 10:11.270
<b>I can't believe it.
They actually defeated Majin Buu!</b>

10:14.480 --> 10:17.650
<b>Everyone who would
stand in your way is gone.</b>

10:29.370 --> 10:35.050
<b>And now you have become king of
the Demon Realm in both name and reality.</b>

10:35.130 --> 10:38.510
<b>Congratulations, King Gomah.</b>

10:52.480 --> 10:53.480
<b>Sister…!</b>

10:54.770 --> 10:59.070
<b>Excuse me. You're here, too, Degesu?</b>

10:59.150 --> 11:03.660
<b>Hello, Dr. Arinsu.
You're looking as beautiful as ever.</b>

11:03.740 --> 11:05.660
<b>Why thank you.</b>

11:05.740 --> 11:07.870
<b>How goes your research?</b>

11:07.950 --> 11:11.290
<b>It's going quite splendidly.</b>

11:11.370 --> 11:16.960
<b>More importantly, congratulations.
I see we have a new Supreme Demon King.</b>

11:17.050 --> 11:18.800
<b>How did you know?</b>

11:18.880 --> 11:23.930
<b>It seems my older sister was also watching
from somewhere.</b>

11:24.640 --> 11:30.060
<b>It's not like King Dabura
to go to the outside world is it?</b>

11:30.140 --> 11:32.520
<b>It piqued my curiosity.</b>

11:32.600 --> 11:35.690
<b>Isn't that the same as you two?</b>

11:35.770 --> 11:38.530
<b>Well, I guess that's true.</b>

11:38.610 --> 11:41.490
<b>Still, it's unfortunate for you!</b>

11:41.570 --> 11:46.830
<b>King Dabura may have given you
all the research funding you wanted,</b>

11:46.910 --> 11:49.160
<b>but he's been murdered.</b>

11:49.250 --> 11:54.830
<b>Oh? As king, you're going to
continue to fund my research aren't you?</b>

11:54.920 --> 11:56.540
<b>We'll see about that.</b>

11:58.300 --> 12:00.300
<b>You may want to be careful, though.</b>

12:01.220 --> 12:07.140
<b>I mean, who wouldn't be?
They defeated the legendary Majin Buu.</b>

12:07.220 --> 12:11.390
<b>If such people were to invade
the Demon Realm…</b>

12:12.230 --> 12:14.520
<b>I shiver at the thought!</b>

12:15.190 --> 12:16.900
<b>There's no need to worry.</b>

12:16.980 --> 12:23.200
<b>There's no reason why they would risk
the dangers of coming to the Demon Realm.</b>

12:23.280 --> 12:24.740
<b>We can only hope.</b>

12:24.820 --> 12:27.240
<b>Now if you'll excuse me…</b>

12:27.320 --> 12:29.740
<b>"King Gomah."</b>

12:40.380 --> 12:42.130
<b>Will we really be okay?</b>

12:42.670 --> 12:43.590
<b>What?</b>

12:44.260 --> 12:48.430
<b>If such beings really came here,
that would be bad, wouldn't it?</b>

12:48.510 --> 12:52.560
<b>You shouldn't listen to
the ramblings of my sister.</b>

12:52.640 --> 12:55.560
<b>Even if they ever come to the Demon Realm,</b>

12:55.640 --> 12:58.810
<b>they'd never reach this Demon King Palace.</b>

13:09.330 --> 13:11.330
<b>That's it.</b>

13:12.240 --> 13:14.710
<b>Let's use the Dragon Balls!</b>

13:15.580 --> 13:18.460
<b>The Dragon Balls?! Are you serious?</b>

13:19.840 --> 13:23.510
<b><i>The three powerful Tamagamis protect them.</i></b>

13:24.550 --> 13:28.180
<b>Not the Dragon Balls of the Demon Realm.</b>

13:28.260 --> 13:32.770
<b>The small Dragon Balls
of that planet Earth.</b>

13:32.850 --> 13:33.890
<b>Earth's?</b>

13:33.970 --> 13:36.480
<b>That's right. You saw it, didn't you?</b>

13:36.560 --> 13:41.110
<b>Those Dragon Balls
might be easy to gather.</b>

13:41.190 --> 13:43.980
<b>But what will you wish for?</b>

13:44.490 --> 13:47.150
<b>I'm sure their power
is based in white magic,</b>

13:47.240 --> 13:50.950
<b>so I doubt a black wish like
eliminating them will be accepted.</b>

13:52.240 --> 13:54.410
<b>I know that!</b>

13:58.750 --> 14:01.590
<b>We make them young.</b>

14:01.670 --> 14:02.960
<b>What?</b>

14:03.050 --> 14:05.420
<b>That's not a black wish, is it?</b>

14:05.510 --> 14:07.380
<b>That's quite ingenious.</b>

14:10.010 --> 14:12.140
<b>Y-You're still here?!</b>

14:14.930 --> 14:18.600
<b>It'd be nice if you made me young as well.</b>

14:25.440 --> 14:26.900
<b>Make them young?</b>

14:27.490 --> 14:29.450
<b>Th-That's right.</b>

14:30.490 --> 14:36.250
<b>Basically we turn them all into children
to make them harmless.</b>

14:38.000 --> 14:41.750
<b>I see! So we weaken them drastically!</b>

14:42.250 --> 14:44.170
<b>There you have it.</b>

14:44.800 --> 14:47.300
<b>And for my second wish…</b>

14:48.470 --> 14:50.930
<b>Let's get the Evil Third Eye!</b>

14:51.550 --> 14:53.850
<b>The Evil Third Eye!</b>

14:53.930 --> 14:56.680
<b>You mean the legendary Tertian Oculus?!</b>

14:56.770 --> 15:01.600
<b>It was lost during the reign of
Dabura's father, Supreme Demon King Abura.</b>

15:01.690 --> 15:03.230
<b>That's right.</b>

15:03.310 --> 15:07.860
<b>Placing it on the forehead is said to
grant unbelievable power.</b>

15:07.940 --> 15:12.990
<b>Since long ago, it was passed down
among the Supreme Demon Kings,</b>

15:13.070 --> 15:15.870
<b>granting them absolute power!</b>

15:15.950 --> 15:20.250
<b>Indeed it would be
the absolute item to obtain.</b>

15:20.330 --> 15:23.420
<b>Right? And for my third wish…</b>

15:23.500 --> 15:27.920
<b>Please, if I could be given
at least one wish.</b>

15:28.010 --> 15:29.130
<b>Hmm?</b>

15:30.470 --> 15:32.180
<b>I'll consider it.</b>

15:32.260 --> 15:35.220
<b>I'll be busy with my coronation party,</b>

15:35.300 --> 15:41.060
<b>and making speeches in the three
Demon Worlds and appealing to the Majin.</b>

15:41.140 --> 15:45.560
<b>We'll execute my plan after that.
Have my vessel ready.</b>

15:45.650 --> 15:46.940
<b>Understood, sire.</b>

15:49.190 --> 15:52.700
<b>Ah, I'll be bringing Neva the Namek.</b>

15:52.780 --> 15:58.080
<b>He's a little senile, but no one knows
more about the Dragon Balls.</b>

15:58.830 --> 15:59.700
<b>Yes, sire.</b>

16:35.570 --> 16:36.950
<b>Hurry up!</b>

16:39.620 --> 16:41.750
<b>Walk faster!</b>

16:41.830 --> 16:47.750
<b><i>Curses! There's a Dragon Ball right here!</i>
<i>But the darn Tamagami is, too!</i></b>

16:49.040 --> 16:50.710
<b>Hey, good work.</b>

16:57.470 --> 16:59.810
<b>Now hurry up and get in the plane.</b>

17:04.600 --> 17:06.900
<b>Now, now. Don't rush me.</b>

17:09.690 --> 17:13.280
<b>Something smells.
When was the last time you took a shower?</b>

17:13.360 --> 17:19.320
<b>A shower? I think I took one years ago
when I fell in the mud.</b>

17:20.830 --> 17:25.830
<b>Hey, Degesu!
Switch places with me! I'm piloting!</b>

17:25.910 --> 17:28.290
<b>-But…!
-Hurry up!</b>

17:28.380 --> 17:31.420
<b>-Hold on!
-Hurry up and switch!</b>

17:35.170 --> 17:37.760
<b>Where are you taking me?</b>

17:37.840 --> 17:40.180
<b>Like I said, the outside world.</b>

17:40.260 --> 17:43.930
<b>We aren't supposed to go to outside world.</b>

17:44.020 --> 17:46.230
<b>We've already done all the proceedings.</b>

17:46.310 --> 17:48.270
<b>Is this a vacation?</b>

17:48.350 --> 17:50.440
<b>Turn around.</b>

17:50.520 --> 17:52.820
<b>I forgot my toothbrush.</b>

17:52.900 --> 17:54.650
<b>We'll come right back!</b>

17:54.740 --> 17:58.950
<b>We're going to go see a young Namek
for some business!</b>

17:59.030 --> 18:03.160
<b>A Namek? That sounds wonderful.</b>

18:03.240 --> 18:06.460
<b>Other Nameks still exist!</b>

18:22.760 --> 18:27.100
<b>Who goes there? Identify yourself.</b>

18:27.180 --> 18:33.070
<b>The new Supreme Demon King Gomah!
You can call me King Gomah!</b>

18:33.150 --> 18:36.150
<b>Well good for you.</b>

18:36.240 --> 18:39.570
<b>You can spare me the details.</b>

18:40.410 --> 18:43.530
<b>Just say the pin number.</b>

18:44.200 --> 18:45.490
<b>0493.</b>

18:45.580 --> 18:47.200
<b>What?!</b>

18:47.290 --> 18:51.540
<b>So you're going to the outside world…</b>

18:58.800 --> 19:02.510
<b>Very well. I suppose I'll let you go.</b>

19:03.800 --> 19:05.720
<b>That's all?!</b>

19:44.390 --> 19:47.680
<b>So you're going to the outside world?
Which universe?</b>

19:47.760 --> 19:48.720
<b>Universe 7.</b>

19:48.810 --> 19:50.930
<b>What number in Universe 7?</b>

19:51.020 --> 19:53.310
<b>Which is closest to Earth…?</b>

19:53.810 --> 19:54.690
<b>Number 3.</b>

19:54.770 --> 19:58.360
<b>You want to go to number 3?
That's been popular, recently.</b>

19:58.440 --> 19:59.990
<b>Popular?</b>

20:01.450 --> 20:03.700
<b>You mean Dabura and Babidi.</b>

20:03.780 --> 20:06.200
<b>Someone else went there after them.</b>

20:06.280 --> 20:09.660
<b>What?! Who?! Tell me their name!</b>

20:10.250 --> 20:12.040
<b>You're an arrogant one!</b>

20:12.120 --> 20:14.630
<b>I-I'm sorry.</b>

20:14.710 --> 20:17.250
<b>Tell me… please.</b>

20:17.340 --> 20:21.380
<b>I think it was Dr. Arinsu.</b>

20:23.010 --> 20:24.430
<b><i>My sister?!</i></b>

20:25.010 --> 20:26.760
<b>Why would she do that?</b>

20:26.850 --> 20:29.640
<b>She better not be up to something.</b>

20:29.720 --> 20:32.940
<b>Stop wasting time and just go!</b>

20:33.020 --> 20:35.650
<b>You're the one who brought it up.</b>

20:47.200 --> 20:49.530
<b>Trunks, happy birthday!</b>

20:49.620 --> 20:52.450
<b>And congratulations
to the Earth returning!</b>

20:53.790 --> 20:54.960
<b>Cheers!</b>

20:55.040 --> 20:57.170
<b>Thanks!</b>

21:01.050 --> 21:04.090
<b>Hey Trunks, how old are you now?</b>

21:04.170 --> 21:05.590
<b>I'm nine.</b>

21:05.680 --> 21:09.350
<b>Nine, huh?
You're a little short for being nine.</b>

21:09.430 --> 21:12.180
<b>You're one to talk.</b>

21:12.270 --> 21:17.060
<b>Saiyans get a growth spurt at around 15.</b>

21:17.150 --> 21:19.270
<b>Yeah, that happened with you, didn't it?</b>

21:19.360 --> 21:24.030
<b>Well, I guess Vegeta didn't get that big.</b>

21:24.110 --> 21:26.490
<b>Are you picking a fight?</b>

21:27.160 --> 21:30.200
<b>Huh? Supreme Kai-sama!</b>

21:30.280 --> 21:32.330
<b>What are you doin' here?</b>

21:32.910 --> 21:36.670
<b>Well… I had some other business…</b>

21:36.750 --> 21:42.800
<b>Huh? Didn't you two
fuse with your Potaras?</b>

21:42.880 --> 21:47.220
<b>I thought it couldn't be undone!
How'd you do it?!</b>

21:47.800 --> 21:52.970
<b>You and Vegeta-san fused with the Potaras,
but when you were absorbed by Majin Buu,</b>

21:53.060 --> 21:57.020
<b>for some reason
it was undone and you split apart again.</b>

21:58.060 --> 22:03.820
<b>We remembered that
and asked Buu-san to try it again.</b>

22:03.900 --> 22:06.950
<b>When I inhaled them and spit them out,
they were separated.</b>

22:07.030 --> 22:09.990
<b>It appears that Majin Buu's body produces</b>

22:10.070 --> 22:15.660
<b>a mysterious gas
that can reverse a Potara fusion.</b>

22:15.750 --> 22:20.880
<b>Oh come on.
So you didn't really wanna fuse after all?</b>

22:20.960 --> 22:24.250
<b>Well, Kibito is a little old, so…</b>

22:26.420 --> 22:29.130
<b>You never cease to amaze, Goku.</b>

22:29.220 --> 22:35.220
<b>You actually asked Shenron to make Buu
a good guy and let him remain on Earth.</b>

22:35.310 --> 22:39.440
<b>It doesn't look like Gohan-san is here.</b>

22:40.060 --> 22:43.770
<b>Gohan's bein' a little distant.</b>

22:43.860 --> 22:46.400
<b>He said he's busy studyin'.</b>

22:46.490 --> 22:51.110
<b>I suppose he couldn't study much
with all the fighting.</b>

22:53.740 --> 22:55.080
<b>I'm stuffed!</b>

22:55.160 --> 22:57.200
<b>Now that I've had my fill…</b>

22:57.290 --> 22:59.870
<b>Vegeta, wanna train?</b>

23:00.870 --> 23:02.080
<b>Very well.</b>

23:14.760 --> 23:17.640
<b>And there they go again all of a sudden.</b>

23:18.270 --> 23:19.680
<b>Just ignore them.</b>

23:57.470 --> 23:59.890
<b>Ain't you gettin' carried away?</b>

24:23.830 --> 24:26.000
<b>They seem to be having fun.</b>

24:26.080 --> 24:27.880
<b>Shall we join them?</b>

24:27.960 --> 24:32.340
<b>We can't. There's no telling
what can happen at any time.</b>

24:35.640 --> 24:37.970
<b>You're right. Something happened.</b>

24:50.900 --> 24:52.570
<b>We finally made it!</b>

24:55.320 --> 24:56.950
<b>Wh-Who are you?</b>

24:57.030 --> 24:58.280
<b>Oh!</b>

24:58.990 --> 25:01.490
<b>It really is a Namek.</b>

25:01.580 --> 25:06.210
<b>I haven't seen a fellow Namek
in thousands of years.</b>

25:08.040 --> 25:11.550
<b>Are you one of the Supreme Kai?</b>

25:11.630 --> 25:13.340
<b>Not exactly.</b>

25:14.010 --> 25:16.800
<b>We came from the Demon Realm.</b>

25:18.090 --> 25:20.470
<b>As did your ancestors, correct?</b>

25:20.560 --> 25:23.770
<b>See? Your ears are pointy.</b>

25:24.480 --> 25:27.020
<b>You're from the Demon Realm, too.</b>

25:27.100 --> 25:28.650
<b>Move!</b>

25:28.730 --> 25:30.320
<b>Can I help you?</b>

25:30.400 --> 25:33.150
<b>I suppose I'll ask.</b>

25:33.240 --> 25:37.200
<b>You manage
the Dragon Balls of this world, right?</b>

25:38.780 --> 25:42.160
<b>In that case bring them all here.</b>

25:42.240 --> 25:45.910
<b>The Dragon Balls?! I can't do that!</b>

25:46.000 --> 25:48.500
<b>I figured you'd say that.</b>

25:48.580 --> 25:51.460
<b>Good thing I brought this old geezer.</b>

25:51.540 --> 25:53.380
<b>Hey! Do it.</b>

25:53.460 --> 25:55.300
<b>Do what?</b>

25:55.380 --> 25:57.220
<b>We went over this!</b>

25:57.300 --> 26:01.890
<b>I'll extend your life 1,000 years,
so gather the Earth Dragon Balls!</b>

26:01.970 --> 26:05.060
<b>Ah yes. Right…</b>

26:09.440 --> 26:12.360
<b>Who… Who is that…?</b>

26:12.440 --> 26:15.940
<b>The Demon Realm has its own Dragon Balls.</b>

26:16.030 --> 26:20.660
<b>He's the one who made them long ago.</b>

26:21.530 --> 26:23.160
<b>But he also…</b>

26:23.830 --> 26:29.290
<b>created terrifying beings called Tamagamis
to protect the balls,</b>

26:29.370 --> 26:33.250
<b>so for the longest time
no one has had a wish granted.</b>

26:34.000 --> 26:38.380
<b>But we heard that Earth has some,
and that's why we're here.</b>

26:39.550 --> 26:43.850
<b>Wait. Do you intend to use
our Dragon Balls to make a wish?!</b>

26:43.930 --> 26:45.810
<b>Of course I do.</b>

26:58.820 --> 27:00.950
<b>Ah… It looks like</b>

27:01.030 --> 27:06.660
<b>they've granted a wish recently and
are still turned into stones.</b>

27:06.750 --> 27:08.790
<b>This'll be hard to find.</b>

27:38.280 --> 27:40.400
<b>Th-That's…!</b>

27:43.410 --> 27:45.780
<b>One, two, three, four…</b>

27:46.410 --> 27:47.450
<b>Seven!</b>

27:47.540 --> 27:50.370
<b>-Good. Let's begin.
-Neva.</b>

27:51.160 --> 27:55.630
<b>You can restore the Dragon Balls
sooner than normal, right?</b>

28:10.640 --> 28:16.440
<b>I don't know what your wish is, but
I'll die before I tell you the password!</b>

28:16.520 --> 28:20.440
<b>We watched a video of you and took notes.</b>

28:22.700 --> 28:24.360
<b>Rise, Shen--</b>

28:24.450 --> 28:26.950
<b>Stop!</b>

28:31.750 --> 28:33.500
<b>Is there a problem?</b>

28:33.580 --> 28:36.380
<b>Um… Would you like some juice?</b>

28:37.130 --> 28:38.460
<b>No thank you.</b>

28:39.750 --> 28:41.670
<b>Rise, Shenron!</b>

28:42.300 --> 28:45.640
<b>And grant my wish!</b>

29:05.910 --> 29:08.160
<b>Huh? What's going on?</b>

29:08.240 --> 29:10.370
<b>Everything went dark.</b>

29:10.990 --> 29:14.080
<b>Could it be that Shenron was summoned…?</b>

29:14.160 --> 29:19.500
<b>That's not possible.
The Dragon Balls should still be rocks.</b>

29:19.590 --> 29:22.800
<b>I didn't hear about an eclipse.
I wonder what it is.</b>

29:23.630 --> 29:25.130
<b>Supreme Kai-sama.</b>

29:25.220 --> 29:28.050
<b>Kibito, did you sense that, too?</b>

29:28.600 --> 29:30.140
<b>That presence…</b>

29:31.470 --> 29:33.980
<b>Now speak your wish.</b>

29:34.520 --> 29:37.480
<b>I will grant any wish.</b>

29:37.560 --> 29:40.860
<b>Wonderful! Well, let's see…</b>

29:40.940 --> 29:46.990
<b>Turn the ones who fought Majin Buu
and all their friends into children!</b>

29:50.450 --> 29:52.410
<b>Well? What's wrong?!</b>

29:52.910 --> 29:58.420
<b>By children, how old do you mean?</b>

29:58.500 --> 29:59.500
<b>Huh?!</b>

30:00.590 --> 30:04.170
<b>Let me think… Maybe first graders?</b>

30:04.260 --> 30:07.760
<b>And for those who are already children?</b>

30:07.840 --> 30:09.760
<b>You're pretty picky.</b>

30:09.840 --> 30:11.550
<b>Well…</b>

30:12.390 --> 30:13.390
<b>Make them babies!</b>

30:15.480 --> 30:19.270
<b>Well?!
You said you'd grant any wish, right?!</b>

30:20.230 --> 30:22.360
<b>Very well.</b>

30:41.840 --> 30:43.460
<b><i>Hee, hee hee!</i></b>

30:43.550 --> 30:48.090
<b><i>Time to adventure!</i>
<i>You'll be hooked for sure!</i></b>

30:48.590 --> 30:52.720
<b><i>The Demon Realm is full of mystery</i></b>

30:52.800 --> 30:55.850
<b><i>DAIMA wonderland</i></b>

30:56.520 --> 30:58.350
<b><i>Whoopsie daisy!</i></b>

30:58.430 --> 31:03.060
<b><i>Even when your heart shrinks</i>
<i>And you feel low</i></b>

31:03.150 --> 31:07.610
<b><i>Dreams are everywhere</i>
<i>Don't worry about it</i></b>

31:07.690 --> 31:10.700
<b><i>Never give up</i></b>

31:12.160 --> 31:18.160
<b><i>Here comes a New Story</i></b>

31:18.250 --> 31:22.380
<b><i>Thousands of jabs and silly jokes</i></b>

31:22.460 --> 31:25.960
<b><i>They're waitin' for you</i></b>

31:26.050 --> 31:33.010
<b><i>Jaan! Jaka jaan!</i>
<i>The fanfare of courage</i></b>

31:33.850 --> 31:40.770
<b><i>No-holds-barred battles</i>
<i>The excitement ain't stoppin'</i></b>

31:40.850 --> 31:47.400
<b><i>Hey Shenron, grant my wish</i></b>

31:48.280 --> 31:55.200
<b><i>I wanna meet</i>
<i>Someone amazin' again tomorrow</i></b>

31:56.530 --> 32:01.460
<b>GLORIO</b>
