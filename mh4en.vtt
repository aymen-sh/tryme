WEBVTT

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:05.547
At the USJ and at the training camp...

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:08.383
I led the villains to our location.

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:11.886
Midoriya, I am...

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.390
a good-for-nothing villain.

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:17.058
Of course not!

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.062
Take my hand, Aoyama.

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:24.190
You can still

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.569
be a hero!

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.910
{\an8}ORIGINAL STORY BY KOHEI HORIKOSHI

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.166
Aoyama is the only one right now

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.587
who can deceive All For One.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.553
Why?

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:20.557
Why?

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:26.187
Why do they care about me?

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.108
A good-for-nothing villain like me.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:35.446
Wait. Hold on a second, guys.
Don't get ahead of yourselves.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.909
He committed a crime.
It's not like I want to say this,

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.953
but you guys are the biggest victims.

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.956
Can you guys really trust him?

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:52.255
Everything he did is in the past.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.884
We couldn't understand
what was in his heart,

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.802
and we're responsible for that.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:02.765
That's exactly why we want to reach out
as friends and help our classmate

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.935
who is crying in despair.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.187
We want him to accept and take our hand.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:11.983
That's the only way
for him and the rest of us

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.405
to stand on equal ground once again!

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:21.284
I was put through the wringer
during training camp.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.037
Take five blasts of my Howitzer
and we'll call it even.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.331
We can't tell if you're joking or not.
Stop it.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:27.874
That's right.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.628
Aoyama felt he had to follow orders
from All For One because he was helpless.

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:33.880
But things are different now.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:36.466
You tried to persuade
your parents to stop, right?

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.635
When we went to stop Midoriya...

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.304
did anyone blame him for being Quirkless?

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.182
Did we hate him for holding back his tears

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.476
and keeping a secret from us?

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.187
Do you remember what we said at that time?

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.439
We said,
"Let's share the responsibilities."

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:53.775
"We won't let you go alone."

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:57.278
"Giving help that's not asked for,
that's the true essence of a hero!"

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.240
Aoyama! It's not over yet!

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.992
We can still stand firm together!

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:07.288
-Aoyama!
-Aoyama!

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.790
Hold on.

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:11.125
I'm sorry to put a damper on things,

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.796
but we'll first get the Aoyama family
to cooperate with this investigation.

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:18.007
Lies won't work on All For One.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.302
We just heard that lying
will get them killed.

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:24.472
I understand how you all feel,
but let's keep our cool.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.224
{\an8}Midoriya.

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:30.019
You talked about luring All For One,

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.564
but do you have anything specific in mind?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.401
No, not really.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:39.028
That's what I thought. Jeez.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:44.033
Mr. Tsukauchi, I'm responsible for this
because I failed to notice.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.412
But I feel the same way
as the students do.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:48.496
Aizawa.

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:52.166
Aoyama, I still...

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.963
don't plan on expelling you.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.553
As the teacher for Class 1-A,
I have an idea.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.471
An idea?

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:09.392
Mr. Tsukauchi, please make sure
that Aoyama and his parents

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:12.145
can't hear what I'm about to say.

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:13.896
Okay, got it.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:21.154
The strategy I came up with is...

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:28.494
I see. Every location will need
to be inspected,

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:31.164
but it's highly feasible.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.208
Yes, although it will all depend on him.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:38.504
We only have a week. It's better
than just sitting around and waiting.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.175
It's worth giving it a shot, huh.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:45.178
We'll conduct further inspection
back at the headquarters.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.976
This information cannot be leaked

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.896
to anyone who is not here right now.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.190
Aoyama!

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:18.002
-We need to start by preparing.
-Right.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:21.130
I have to start by repairing my costume

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.342
-since it was torn to pieces.
-Me too.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.886
Let's continue with intense training

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.139
-so we can utilize our Quirks to the max.
-Right.

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:35.103
Let's make sure
to take him down, everyone.

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:36.854
Yes!

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:43.486
In order to prepare for our next battle...

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.489
To take all possible measures...

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.576
There's equipment that needs
to be repaired.

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.622
Déjà vu?

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.417
Ow, ow, ow.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.128
Ouch.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:03.923
Oh, my. Long time no see, Midoriya.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.888
Sorry about that.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.766
What can I help you guys with?

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.812
My Danger Sense didn't activate.
I was totally caught off guard!

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:19.814
It was her breasts after all!

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:21.691
Anyway, Hatsume,

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:25.778
we're here to get our costumes repaired.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:30.366
Huh? Why don't you ask
the Item Agency like always?

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.745
Huh? Oh, the Item Agency is currently...
Or more like,

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:36.789
the distribution system
is not functioning.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.708
That's why we came to the Support Course.

00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:42.920
-I see. Understandable.
-What?

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.130
Huh?

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:47.341
Hatsume... Don't tell me...

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.179
Is she unaware of everything
that's going on in the world right now?

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:54.056
Hatsume!

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.059
Why do you have to blow things up
all the time?

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:01.731
You guys must be here
for the costume repairs. Come inside.

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:11.282
This place looks different now.

00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:14.285
It's the UA Barrier built
by the support of the principal.

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:17.163
I'm in charge of developing it.

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:19.332
I'll also handle the maintenance
once it's up and running.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.043
It's all hands on deck
for the Support Course.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.545
I see.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.299
Mid-Gauntlet.

00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:31.052
That's an item using
the latest compression technology.

00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:34.597
It's a prototype from overseas,
so I don't have any extras.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.307
I'd like to have this repaired.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.560
Do you need it right away?

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:41.395
Yes.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.606
Then it's impossible. Sorry!

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:47.485
With that level of damage,
I'll practically have to remake it.

00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:51.322
But we don't have the Condenium necessary
for the compression mechanism. So nope.

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:52.323
Sorry.

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:54.408
She's running away so fast!

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.369
Hatsume, can you work on my armor?

00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:57.954
Not without the specs!

00:08:58.037 --> 00:08:59.038
How direct!

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.749
Don't worry, we'll make it.

00:09:01.832 --> 00:09:03.292
We're Hatsume's classmates.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.670
Thank you so much. We appreciate it.

00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:07.213
Don't worry about it.

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:09.465
But that was unexpected.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.301
Hatsume loves tinkering with machines,

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.471
so I thought she'd accept our request
and offer to help.

00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:19.016
Hatsume, what are you making?

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.729
Did it just fly? That's amazing!

00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:29.151
Hatsume is helping out with the work
to strengthen the UA Barrier.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:33.114
She's coming up with a new mechanism
to be used during evacuations.

00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:34.991
I'm sure I've mentioned this before,

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:38.369
but her vitality and novel ideas
are phenomenally unique.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.205
If you need to cool off your legs,

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:44.125
just run with your arms instead!

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.502
Even a perfect A+ idea

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.130
could lower to an A- a minute later.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.674
"That's why I have to keep
raising my babies!"

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.301
Those are words I live by!

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:55.136
Those were Hatsume's words.

00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:56.971
I see.

00:09:57.054 --> 00:09:59.807
That's why you don't get distracted
by the outside world

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.935
and absorb yourself with inventing
that you love so much.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.896
Hatsume, you're really amazing.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.316
You're so dense, Midoriya,

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.484
dense like polyethylene.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.236
I don't understand.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.657
I know that you heroes
are in a difficult situation right now.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.619
We aren't fighters.

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:23.623
Therefore, we conduct many trials
and find their errors, so that you guys

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:26.500
-can save as many people as possible.
-Yup.

00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:29.337
That's why we're the same.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:34.091
Inventing things is how we
at the Support Course act as heroes.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.470
Hatsume...

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:39.889
I couldn't make a replica.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.642
It's not as great as the Mid-Gauntlet,

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:46.145
but if you'd like, please put my babies
to good use.

00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:48.731
There's even a glove on it!

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.941
Were you making this
with just your left hand?

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:56.072
Ida, I couldn't make an exact replica
of your armor, but please give that a try.

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.865
Yay! Thank you!

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:00.076
We were getting ready...

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.786
...to take measurements.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.206
Please send a message
to everyone in the Hero Course...

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.042
Let's win this!

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:09.669
Yes.

00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:15.216
Hey, you're here earlier than expected.

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:17.009
We just got ready...

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:19.220
Glad we made it in time.

00:11:19.303 --> 00:11:21.722
Shouldn't you guys
be back to normal by now?

00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:26.018
I heard about what happened to Class A.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:29.688
But we can't afford to waste another day.

00:11:30.272 --> 00:11:34.026
Our best plan is still to find and
sweep up the Paranormal Liberation Front

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.196
and the League of Villains
as soon as possible.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.283
We cannot abandon the shortest route
that will end all this.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.703
Getting confused and coming to a halt
will only play into our enemy's hands!

00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:47.206
Will Aoyama...

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:50.709
accept our outstretched hand?

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:52.711
I believe in him.

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:56.674
Aoyama will come back for sure.

00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:00.678
I hope he hasn't placed a curse
on himself.

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.348
I think he'll be okay.

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.517
I'm sure his eyes

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.565
have always been fixed on the person
he wanted to be, more than anyone.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.737
Let's focus and begin!

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:22.324
Midoriya, Bakugo, and Todoroki
will take the lead, and the class

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:24.577
will be deployed in groups of three.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.998
UA High School, Class 1-A, Hero Course.

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:31.250
Search Team, assemble!

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:35.045
{\an8}KANSAI REGION

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:37.590
{\an8}Meanwhile...

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:40.134
Output 100%.

00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:41.802
Nejire Flood!

00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:49.810
Anyone injured, Suneater?

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.772
Ne... ji... re...

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.774
Thank you! Thank you!

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:59.195
The villains began to do as they pleased
in the countryside, so we ran.

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:02.364
Don't you worry! You're all okay now.

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:06.577
I'll guide you to Shiketsu High School.
It's a fortress that rivals UA.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.871
Thank you! Please show us your face!

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:11.957
No... I cannot show it to you.

00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:15.461
It's a given that
we'll protect the evacuees.

00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:17.838
But that means fewer people in town,

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.591
and thus, we won't get any intel
on the villains.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:22.426
It's a difficult situation.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.970
We've finally come to this point...

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:27.640
So far, we've conducted
two surprise attacks,

00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:30.976
but now, we'll be taking a completely
different route where both sides

00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:33.938
will be fully prepared

00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:37.358
for the start of an all-out war.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.946
{\an8}TENYA IIDA

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:45.950
{\an8}SHOTA AIZAWA

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:47.076
{\an8}CENTRAL HOSPITAL

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.994
{\an8}Central Hospital.

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:52.331
To conceal their cooperation
with this important facility,

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:55.584
several police stations moved their bases

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.503
to buildings nearby.

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.588
As for our alternative plan...

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:03.384
I've gathered necessary requirements
for the upcoming battle.

00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:08.013
Young Aoyama is currently
waiting on test results.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.890
The Aoyama incident

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.893
instantly restricted our next moves.

00:14:13.477 --> 00:14:16.313
All of you here have been deemed
trustworthy based on your actions

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:19.733
and various circumstantial evidence,
so we will begin this meeting.

00:14:20.317 --> 00:14:23.571
Endeavor, Best Jeanist,
and other big heroes

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.364
will be taking command on-site.

00:14:25.447 --> 00:14:28.701
This is last-minute,
but it's a confidential meeting,

00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:31.954
so we're being extra cautious
and limiting the number of people.

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:36.792
I fully understand that, but still...

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:40.045
Wild, Wild

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:41.881
Pussycats!

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:45.009
It's sad that Ryuko and the rest
aren't here.

00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:48.596
Sorry. It's not that we're doubting
the loyalty of your members.

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:50.764
-Meow.
-Meow.

00:14:51.765 --> 00:14:55.519
Shigaraki and the rest are using
my Search Quirk for the wrong purpose.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.771
So you have my full support.
So let us know

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.232
about the "necessary requirements".

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:08.490
Whether we go with our original plan
or an alternate plan,

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.910
one thing we must do at all costs...

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.496
is separate them.

00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:19.251
According to footage
from the battle with Star and Stripe,

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:20.753
Tomura Shigaraki's power

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:23.380
has easily surpassed All For One.

00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:26.675
Everyone who watched the battle at Kamino

00:15:27.384 --> 00:15:30.095
knows the extent of All For One's power.

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:33.223
In addition to the attacks
using Radio Waves

00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:36.101
displayed during the Assault on Tartarus,

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:39.647
we're also not aware of the extent to
which they're able to share their minds.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:44.526
If both of them come at us together,
we will have no chance of winning.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.281
Then why didn't they team up
to fight against Star?

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:52.242
To prevent Star from calling
out their names.

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:53.661
According to New Order's restrictions,

00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:57.748
the rule would've worked
once Star said the name "All For One".

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.960
During this upcoming battle,

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:05.130
{\an8}we will keep them
at least ten kilometers apart.

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:08.676
{\an8}This is the minimum prerequisite
for our victory.

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:11.345
I'm sure the enemies will plan their moves

00:16:11.428 --> 00:16:13.263
to prevent this from happening.

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.849
That's right, Tsukauchi.

00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:20.396
The terrifying and far-reaching flames
that reduce all to ashes.

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:25.317
It's a threat we experienced
during training camp.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.737
Once Dabi is in the vanguard,

00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:31.156
we will be forced to stop.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.908
So basically...

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.828
in order to separate
All For One and Shigaraki,

00:16:35.911 --> 00:16:37.454
we'll first separate Dabi...

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:39.206
It's not just Dabi.

00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:42.418
That's right. It's everyone.

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:49.466
We'll split up all the main villains
and destroy each one!

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:53.929
In order to do that,
we must lure out the enemies.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.850
But isn't that just wishful thinking?

00:16:57.933 --> 00:16:59.518
It's easier said than done.

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:03.814
Yes. Therefore, in order to meet
all the necessary requirements,

00:17:03.897 --> 00:17:05.441
we need a strategy.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:07.943
Aoyama, huh?

00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:10.821
He's still shaken up.

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:15.659
He's a young boy who was born Quirkless
and was taken advantage of.

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.536
I sympathize with him,

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.456
but it doesn't change the fact
that he chose to save himself

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.750
by betraying us and our society.

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:26.837
Because of my position,
I have to be very cautious.

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:30.674
I want to believe

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:32.342
in young Aoyama.

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:36.388
And I will trust

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:41.435
his teacher, Shota Aizawa.

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:46.690
The test results show
no signs of abnormalities.

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:50.194
His brain waves and nervous system
are in good order too.

00:17:52.613 --> 00:17:55.032
The Quirk that self-destructed Lady Nagant

00:17:55.991 --> 00:18:00.245
was acquired after getting defeated
by All Might, huh?

00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:02.498
Come to think of it,

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:07.044
if he plants destructive bombs inside
his lackeys in case they betray him,

00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:10.881
he wouldn't need to murder betrayers
as a warning to prevent them from lying

00:18:10.964 --> 00:18:13.926
or to threaten them
with horrifying possibilities.

00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:17.763
That's why All For One planted

00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:22.101
seeds of fear into this young boy

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:23.894
and his parents.

00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:26.897
Are you scared?

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.026
You won't find many friends in life

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.403
who will stand up for you like that.

00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:37.116
We want to reach out as friends
and help our classmate

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:40.160
who is crying in despair.

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:45.290
What are you scared of?
Are you scared of All For One?

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:47.000
Yes.

00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:50.045
And I...

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.090
can't sparkle like they do.

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:55.884
That scares me.

00:18:57.469 --> 00:19:00.264
The more they place their faith in me,

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:04.434
the more I lose faith in myself.

00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:08.147
Even if I were to grab hold
of their hands,

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:11.567
once I come face to face with All For One,

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:15.112
I might repeat the same mistake.

00:19:15.904 --> 00:19:18.157
That thought scares me.

00:19:19.783 --> 00:19:21.618
That's why I want to quit.

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:25.998
I want to go somewhere dark,
with no light,

00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:29.126
and wait for my death.

00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:33.172
You may be able to plead
for extenuating circumstances,

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:35.757
but your sin will not disappear.

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:39.970
Aoyama, even when this battle ends,

00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:42.931
you may not be able to remain at UA.

00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:46.810
Your friends sugarcoated things,

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:50.189
but I won't do that.
I'll be straight with you.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.275
Even if by force, I have to uproot

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:55.694
the fear that's been rooted in him.

00:19:56.278 --> 00:20:00.574
Fight. You have no choice but to fight.

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:04.912
I know that. We have to win this. I know.

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.372
I know that I have to become

00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:10.709
a pawn in order to win this...
To be on equal footing...

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:11.835
You're right.

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.839
In terms of using you to our advantage,

00:20:15.923 --> 00:20:19.843
we might be no different than All For One.

00:20:20.677 --> 00:20:24.473
But I won't let you be tormented
by your sins

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:28.268
and die a lonely death,

00:20:29.853 --> 00:20:31.772
not as long as I'm
your Hero Course teacher

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:34.608
and you're my student.

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:39.947
I still don't plan on expelling you.

00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:45.202
I don't teach my students
to live their lives

00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:46.954
wallowing in guilt.

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:51.333
Even if you feel ashamed and pathetic,
live together with the friends

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:53.877
who have held out their hands to you.

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.214
We will protect you.

00:20:58.006 --> 00:20:59.716
I promise you that.

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:03.929
You'll be fine
as long as you're with them.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:12.229
But how can a single wrongdoer like me

00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:13.730
be of any help?

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:18.568
There's no way he's not scared.
Anyone would be scared.

00:21:19.486 --> 00:21:20.862
That's why...

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:24.700
You didn't think I'd make you
walk this path on your own, right?

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:28.578
You students,

00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:31.623
us teachers, and pro-heroes too...

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.459
It's a path

00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:37.129
that we're all on together.

00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:16.645
Hey! Let's go! It's almost time.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.773
Yeah.

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:22.943
Preview of the next episode.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.279
The final battle is near.

00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:30.117
Both the heroes and villains
heading into battle

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.994
have various thoughts
passing through their minds...

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:36.873
trying to forget the past,
desiring to change the present,

00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:40.252
and striving towards the future.

00:23:40.335 --> 00:23:43.338
Next episode, "Let You Down."

00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:48.009
What will we gain, and what will we lose?

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:50.929
Go Beyond! Plus Ultra!

00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:51.972
