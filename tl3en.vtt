WEBVTT

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:11.070
THE LAST OF US

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:05.124
10 MILES WEST OF BOSTON

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:28.815
You want your jacket back?

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.260
I've never been in the woods.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:02.348
More bugs than I thought.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.064
-Look, I've been thinking about--
-I don't want your sorries.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.733
I wasn't gonna say I'm sorry.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:14.861
I was gonna say that I've been
thinking about what happened.

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.238
Nobody made you or Tess take me.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.157
Nobody made you go along with this plan.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.534
You needed a truck battery or whatever

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.411
and you made a choice.

00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:27.040
So don't blame me
for something that isn't my fault.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.482
How much longer?

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.817
Five-hour hike.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.737
We can manage that.

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.933
You've gone this way a lot?

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:30.144
-No Infected?
-Not often, no.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.479
What are you looking out for?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.314
People.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.694
-Are Bill and Frank nice?
-Frank is.

00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:41.656
How'd you get that scar on your head?

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.366
What? Is it something lame?

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.201
Like you fell down the stairs
or something?

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.537
-I didn't fall down any stairs.
-Okay, so what then?

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:49.789
Someone shot at me and missed.

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:51.416
See, that's cool.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.418
You shoot back?

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.253
-Yeah.
-You get him?

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.463
No, I missed, too.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.008
It happens more often than you think.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.343
'Cause you suck at shooting
or, like, in general?

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.098
In general.

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:15.523
You know, seeing as
it's just the two of us,

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:17.525
-I was thinking I should pro--
-No.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:29.078
Cumberland Farms.

00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:32.165
Hang back a minute.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.374
I gotta grab some stuff I stashed.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:34.542
CUMBERLAND
FARMS

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:35.752
Stashed?

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.003
Why do you have stuff stashed here?

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:39.213
You ask a lot of goddamn questions.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.049
Yes, I do.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:47.013
So, are you gonna answer me or what?

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:49.849
We hide supplies on routes

00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:51.809
in case we find ourselves
short on gear,

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:55.354
-which I currently am 'cause--
-No way!

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:58.566
You ever play this one?

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:59.609
MORTAL KOMBAT II

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.819
I had a friend who knew
everything about this game.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.238
There's this one character
named Mileena who takes off her mask

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:06.741
and she has monster teeth
and then she swallows you whole

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:08.159
and barfs out your bones.

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.454
Oh, man.

00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:15.541
LIFESAVERS

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:16.626
You forgot where you put your stuff.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.921
No, I'm just zeroing in on it.

00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:22.715
-It's been a couple of years.
-Okay, well, I'm gonna

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.051
take a look around,
see if there's anything good.

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:26.886
Trust me,
it's all been picked over already.

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.679
Maybe, maybe not.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.517
-Is there anything bad in here?
-Just you.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:34.811
Getting funnier.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.898
Fuck.

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.684
-You all right back there?
-Yep!

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.043
TAMPAX
PEARL

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:23.377
Fuck yeah.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.080
Ellie?

00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:31.839
Ellie!

00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:40.181
NO
SMOKING

00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:41.098
Ellie?

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.353
Picked over, my ass.

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:51.901
TAMPAX
PEARL

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:00.910
What are you doing?

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.412
There's not much ammo
out there for this thing.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.914
Makes it mostly useless.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:06.916
Well, if you're just gonna leave it there.

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.086
No.

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:26.602
Holy shit.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.191
You fly in one of those?

00:11:32.274 --> 00:11:34.819
-Few times, sure.
-So lucky.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.446
Didn't feel like it at the time.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.408
Get shoved into a middle seat,
pay 12 bucks for a sandwich.

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:43.035
Dude, you got to go up in the sky.

00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:46.622
Yeah, well, so did they.

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:53.921
Grim.

00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:58.175
So everything came
crashing down in one day?

00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.844
-Pretty much.
-How?

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.805
I mean, no one was infected
with Cordyceps,

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:04.098
everybody's fine,

00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:07.226
eating in restaurants
and flying in planes.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.728
And then, all at once?

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.480
How did it even start?

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.524
If you have to get bit to be infected,

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:15.901
then who bit the first person?

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.528
Was it a monkey?
I bet it was a monkey.

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:19.447
It wasn't a monkey.
I thought you went to school.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.906
FEDRA school.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.200
They don't teach us
how their shitty government

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.035
failed to prevent a pandemic.

00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:32.543
No one knows for sure,
but, best guess,

00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:35.129
Cordyceps mutated.

00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:37.715
And some of it got into the food supply.

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:40.718
Probably a basic ingredient
like flour or sugar.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.888
There were certain brands of food
that were sold everywhere,

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:46.015
all across the country, across the world.

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:50.019
Bread, cereal, pancake mix.

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:54.398
You eat enough of it,
it'll get you infected.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.402
So the tainted food
all hits the store shelves

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.237
around the same time, Thursday.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.992
People bought it,
ate some Thursday night or Friday morning.

00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:08.496
Day goes on, they started to get sick.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.500
Afternoon, evening, they got worse.

00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:16.795
Then they started bitin'.

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:21.800
Friday night, September 26, 2003.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.306
And by Monday, everything was gone.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.899
It makes more sense
than monkeys.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.817
Thanks.

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.154
Sure.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:46.825
What?

00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:50.996
-We'll cut across the woods here.
-Isn't the road easier?

00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:53.707
Yeah, it's just--

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:56.085
There's stuff up there you shouldn't see.

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:59.880
-Well, now I have to see.
-I don't want you to.

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.216
Serious. Ellie.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:03.926
Can it hurt me?

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.927
No.

00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:08.222
You're too honest, man.

00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:10.224
Should've said axe murderer.

00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:18.148
Whatever it was,

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.234
think it's gone.

00:14:41.338 --> 00:14:43.882
About a week after Outbreak Day,
soldiers

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:48.846
went through the countryside,
evacuated the small towns.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:53.058
Told you you were goin' to a QZ,
and you were,

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:55.477
if there was room.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.856
If there wasn't.

00:15:07.531 --> 00:15:09.450
These people weren't sick?

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:11.827
No, probably not.

00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:17.458
Why kill them?

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.669
Why not just leave 'em be?

00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:23.756
Dead people can't be infected.

00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:24.316
No, sir. We're in the basement now.
There's no one here.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.318
Let's check back with the others.

00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:31.782

I don't know.

00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:14.624
I thought about lying for some reason,

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:17.252
but a reason didn't come.

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:20.714
Look, I'm just trying to get to Boston.

00:22:20.797 --> 00:22:21.923

We started with 10.

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:26.928
But yeah, I'm alone.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.346
From where?

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.265
Baltimore QZ.

00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:32.642
It's gone.

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:36.772
Are ya hurt?

00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:40.025
There's just a bruise.

00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:53.497
Oh fuck.

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:13.350
Stop there.

00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:20.524
How'd you get that?

00:23:45.423 --> 00:23:46.675
Boston is that way.

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:51.179
-You can make it by nightfall.
-I'm really hungry.

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.806
I haven't eaten in two days.

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:58.311
It doesn't sound very
long out loud, does it?

00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:01.982
-It feels long.
-I'm letting you go, so go.

00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:03.608
All right, look.

00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:06.403
-First, my name's Frank--
-Oh, yeah?

00:24:06.486 --> 00:24:07.821
Here's the thing, Frank.

00:24:07.904 --> 00:24:10.657
If I feed you,
then every bum you talk to about it

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.618
is gonna show up here
lookin' for a free lunch,

00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:15.829
and this is not an Arby's.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.749
Well, Arby's didn't have free lunch.
It was a restaurant.

00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:28.717
I won't talk about it to any bums,
or hobos or vagabonds, I promise.

00:24:35.724 --> 00:24:38.643
You already know I'm bad at lying.

00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:17.224
I left some clothes here for ya.

00:25:18.725 --> 00:25:20.060
What?

00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:21.811
Clothes!

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.814
Thank you! Almost done.

00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:29.110
Although can I have five more minutes?

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:30.111
Sure.

00:25:30.737 --> 00:25:32.155
Sure!

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:35.367
Thank you! This is amazing!

00:27:05.498 --> 00:27:06.624
What the fuck?

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:10.128
Everything tastes good
when you're starving.

00:27:10.211 --> 00:27:12.339
Yeah, but not like this.

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:16.176
My God.

00:27:23.558 --> 00:27:25.435
BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES

00:27:25.518 --> 00:27:28.688
A man who knows to pair rabbit
with a Beaujolais.

00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:30.899
I know I don't seem like the type.

00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:33.109
No, you do.

00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:08.728
-There is more, if--
-No, I can't.

00:28:09.687 --> 00:28:11.481
I want to, believe me.

00:28:11.564 --> 00:28:12.399
But...

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:16.778
Thank you.

00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:22.534
Thank you.

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:27.539
You're welcome.

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:40.051
So, I guess I'll be going then.

00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:50.019
But first.

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:57.444
I've been staring at this the whole time.

00:28:57.527 --> 00:29:00.155
-Is it antique?
-1948.

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.156
Wow.

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:03.074
You know how much these are worth?

00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:04.784
Currently, nothing.

00:29:06.286 --> 00:29:09.622
"Fur Elise." "Tales of Hoffmann"?
Yuck.

00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:12.792
-These aren't yours.
-My mother's. Could you not--

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:14.878
This is you.

00:29:20.508 --> 00:29:23.428
Oh, my God, It's my favorite.

00:29:25.722 --> 00:29:28.850
THE BEST OF LINDA RONSTADT

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:04.761
No. No. No, no, no, no.
No, thank you. Sorry.

00:30:04.844 --> 00:30:08.223
-Not this song. Not this song.
-Well, I'm not a professional.

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.849
Well, neither am I, but--

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.525
And then I'll leave.

00:32:05.965 --> 00:32:08.092
So, who's the girl?

00:32:09.385 --> 00:32:11.304
Girl you're singing about?

00:32:14.307 --> 00:32:15.850
There is no girl.

00:32:20.688 --> 00:32:22.023
I know.

00:32:57.266 --> 00:32:58.810
What's your name?

00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:03.272
Bill.

00:33:13.282 --> 00:33:15.201
Go take a shower, Bill.

00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:17.578
Okay.

00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:41.746
Have you ever done this before?

00:34:43.122 --> 00:34:44.665
Not with anyone?

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.378
-With a girl a long time ago--
-Yeah, I know, so.

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:54.467
I'm gonna start with the simple things.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.346
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:04.060
But before I do, I want you to know
that I'm not a whore.

00:35:06.062 --> 00:35:10.191
I don't have sex for lunches,

00:35:11.859 --> 00:35:13.778
not even great ones.

00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:20.034
So, if I do this,

00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:23.663
I am gonna stay for a few more days.

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:27.291
Is that okay?

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.960
Yeah.

00:35:29.043 --> 00:35:29.961
Yes.

00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:07.999
Fuck you!

00:36:08.082 --> 00:36:08.958
Come on!

00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:09.959
THREE YEARS LATER
2010

00:36:10.042 --> 00:36:11.669
Hey! Would you stop?

00:36:11.752 --> 00:36:13.963
Do I ask for things? Ever?

00:36:15.047 --> 00:36:16.215
Why am I even saying that?

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:18.342
This isn't for me.
This is for us.

00:36:18.426 --> 00:36:19.760
Who cares what they look like?

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.178
I do!

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:23.639
Our home isn't just our house.

00:36:23.723 --> 00:36:25.057
It's everything around us!

00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:28.352
-Give me a fuckin' break!
-I'm sorry, I forgot.

00:36:28.436 --> 00:36:29.812
I live in this world.

00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:33.065
You live in a psycho bunker
where 9/11 was an inside job

00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:35.109
and the government are all Nazis.

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:39.614
-The government are all Nazis!
-Well, yeah, now! But not then!

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:46.704
I am asking for some paint

00:36:46.787 --> 00:36:48.581
and some gasoline for the lawnmower.

00:36:48.664 --> 00:36:50.958
That's all.
I'll do everything else myself.

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.961
-It is not a mat--
-Bill, if you say "resource management,"

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:56.964
so help me,
I will run through one of your trip wires.

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.429
Okay, okay.

00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:07.725
-Just tell me why.
-I did.

00:37:08.809 --> 00:37:11.145
Paying attention to things,

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:14.398
it's how we show love.

00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:17.443
This is my street, too.

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:20.821
Just let me love it the way I want to.

00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:25.910
And I'm fixing up some of the shops.

00:37:27.203 --> 00:37:28.245
Not the stupid ones.

00:37:28.329 --> 00:37:31.248
Just the wine shop
and the furniture store.

00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:34.085
And the clothing boutique.

00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:36.504
The boutique?

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.924
Are we hosting
formal garden parties now?

00:37:40.007 --> 00:37:41.133
No.

00:37:42.718 --> 00:37:45.054
But we are gonna have friends.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.975
Excuse me?

00:37:52.311 --> 00:37:53.896
We're gonna make friends,

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.649
and we will invite them to visit.

00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:03.531
We don't have friends, Frank.

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:07.910
We will never have friends
because there are no friends to be had.

00:38:07.994 --> 00:38:10.663
Well, I've actually
been talking to a nice woman on the radio.

00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:14.250
You what?

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.336
Well, this really is just-- it's amazing.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.212
Right?

00:38:18.921 --> 00:38:20.047
Can you not, please?

00:38:25.594 --> 00:38:28.597
-I'm the same way.
-You're a paranoid schizophrenic, too?

00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:30.433
I'm not schizophrenic.

00:38:35.521 --> 00:38:39.734
Well, can I just say, gun aside,
which I get, by the way,

00:38:40.234 --> 00:38:44.405
how nice this is to have a civilized meal
in such a beautiful place?

00:38:44.488 --> 00:38:46.240
It's been so long.

00:38:46.323 --> 00:38:48.367
I mean, I wanna thank you.

00:38:48.451 --> 00:38:50.828
Even if we don't end up working together.

00:38:50.911 --> 00:38:52.246
I really needed this.

00:38:52.705 --> 00:38:54.457
We are working together.

00:38:58.586 --> 00:38:59.712
We are.

00:39:01.714 --> 00:39:03.758
You know what? Let's go inside.

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:04.800
Tess, I wanna show you something.

00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:07.053
-I have been wanting to see inside.
-Bring your wine.

00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:08.012
-Not inside.
-Thank you.

00:39:08.095 --> 00:39:09.221
-Yes.
-Frank.

00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:10.181
Frank!

00:39:20.983 --> 00:39:21.984
I understand.

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:24.028
If my,

00:39:26.405 --> 00:39:27.364
if mine,

00:39:30.284 --> 00:39:33.871
brought strangers into our situation,
I wouldn't be happy either.

00:39:33.954 --> 00:39:36.332
But of all the people
he could've found on the radio,

00:39:36.415 --> 00:39:39.085
we're actually
decent people just tryin' to get by.

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:42.755
Well, aren't I the lucky one?

00:39:42.838 --> 00:39:44.799
There's stuff we have in the QZ
that you don't have here.

00:39:46.092 --> 00:39:48.803
Books, medicine, machine parts.

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:52.139
We can help each other,
and get that gun outta my face.

00:40:02.691 --> 00:40:04.610
So, what, you were a

00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:08.239
prepper or somethin'?

00:40:08.322 --> 00:40:09.865
"Survivalist."

00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:13.702
Maybe you are decent people, maybe not.

00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:14.703
Doesn't matter.

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.997
We're self-sufficient here.

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:22.795
I don't need you or your friend
complicating our lives.

00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:24.880
Is that clear?

00:40:27.883 --> 00:40:30.010
That fence has got a year on it, tops.

00:40:31.554 --> 00:40:34.098
Galvanized wire
already started to corrode.

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:39.186
I can get you 10 spools
of high-tensile aluminum.

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:41.689
Last you the rest of your life.

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:46.235
Lives.

00:40:51.031 --> 00:40:54.285
-Are you sure about this?
-Yeah. It's not a gift.

00:40:54.368 --> 00:40:56.495
-You'll come back, we'll trade.
-All right.

00:40:56.579 --> 00:40:58.789
And I had this idea that we should

00:40:58.873 --> 00:41:01.542
use codes for the radio
in case anyone's listening.

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:03.419
That's a good idea.
Like, with what?

00:41:03.502 --> 00:41:05.421
I was thinking, like, the decades.

00:41:05.504 --> 00:41:08.299
-Like, '80s, trouble, of course.
-Yeah.

00:41:08.382 --> 00:41:10.217
'70s...

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.219
FEDRA's never gonna come up here.

00:41:13.345 --> 00:41:15.890
And you're well-protected
against stray Infected.

00:41:17.474 --> 00:41:21.020
But sooner or later, there'll be raiders.

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:24.815
And they'll beat that fence
and your tripwires.

00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:26.775
They'll come at night,

00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:28.777
quiet and armed.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.783
We'll be fine.

00:41:53.552 --> 00:41:56.764
THREE YEARS LATER
2013

00:42:02.102 --> 00:42:06.482
-Pick it up.
-Hey, I can't.

00:42:06.565 --> 00:42:08.484
Just one more loop around.

00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:10.736
I got something to show you.

00:42:12.988 --> 00:42:14.031
Not that.

00:42:19.912 --> 00:42:21.288
Nearly there.

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:25.918
You can make it.

00:42:27.753 --> 00:42:28.629
What?

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:30.339
It's okay.

00:42:31.924 --> 00:42:34.051
-Ready?
-Yes.

00:42:41.976 --> 00:42:45.145
I traded Joel and Tess
one of your guns for a packet of seeds.

00:42:46.188 --> 00:42:47.523
Which gun?

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:50.067
A little one.

00:43:44.204 --> 00:43:45.539
I'm sorry.

00:43:47.082 --> 00:43:48.208
For what?

00:43:51.253 --> 00:43:52.880
Gettin' older faster than you.

00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:54.965
I like you older.

00:43:57.509 --> 00:43:59.428
Older means we're still here.

00:44:05.601 --> 00:44:06.518
What?

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:13.233
I was never afraid before you showed up.

00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:32.961
Not on the strawberries.

00:44:33.045 --> 00:44:33.962
Right.

00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:12.000
Shit.

00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:16.922
Bill!

00:45:18.298 --> 00:45:19.091
Bill!

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:21.969
Bill?

00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:23.429
Bill!

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.887
Bill! Bill!

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.180
Get inside!

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:13.729
-No!
-We gotta get you inside.

00:46:13.812 --> 00:46:18.066
-No! No! No!
-Bill, inside, now! Hold on to me.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.694
I gotcha. I gotcha.

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:26.116
Okay.

00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:30.537
There we go.

00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:35.209
Okay, okay. We got this.

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.668
We got this.

00:46:36.752 --> 00:46:38.086
You hold your hand there for me?

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.922
Hold, hold your hand there.

00:46:43.592 --> 00:46:44.468
Frank.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.387
-Frank!
-I'm right here.

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.389
-Frank, leave the gas on!
-I'm right here.

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:51.058
-I'm right here. I'm right here.
-Leave the gas on.

00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:53.435
The fence,
the fence'll kill the rest of 'em.

00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:54.853
Okay, yep.

00:46:55.604 --> 00:46:56.980
I made a list for you.

00:46:58.357 --> 00:46:59.483
Tell me about the list.

00:46:59.566 --> 00:47:02.110
I have copies of all the keys.

00:47:02.194 --> 00:47:03.320
Good.

00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.241
Call Joel.

00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:10.577
You can't be here alone.

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.287
Well, I'm not alone.

00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:14.081
-You're here.
-No.

00:47:14.915 --> 00:47:16.291
Call Joel.

00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:19.711
-Okay, here we go.
-No.

00:47:19.795 --> 00:47:22.714
-It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
-Call Joel. Call Joel.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.388
-He'll take care of ya.
-There we go.

00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:39.064
Okay.

00:47:40.148 --> 00:47:41.233
Okay.

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:51.368
Bill?

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:54.788
Bill.

00:47:58.959 --> 00:48:00.127
It's getting cold.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.420
Okay.

00:48:01.503 --> 00:48:03.422
-Let me bring ya inside.
-Yeah.

00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:10.887
Okay. There we go.

00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:13.640
TEN YEARS LATER
2023

00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:15.767
Okay?

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.104
-We'll get you warmed up.
-Yeah.

00:49:39.393 --> 00:49:41.937
-Did you take your pills?
-No.

00:50:02.749 --> 00:50:04.835
One orangey,

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:12.676
a little whitey, and a big roundy.

00:51:19.785 --> 00:51:23.330
Took most of the night.
I'm exhausted.

00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:25.707
Goddamnit.

00:51:26.833 --> 00:51:28.376
You gotta be kidding me.

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:31.546
I don't want you fallin' asleep
in the chair.

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:33.840
-I won't.
-You will, and then your feet get blue.

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.342
-Bill--
-I'm not fighting about it.

00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:37.719
-Back in bed.
-I promise you, I'm gonna stay up.

00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:40.722
-Why?
-'Cause this is my last day.

00:51:53.693 --> 00:51:54.611
What,

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:56.947
what if we find a doctor?

00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:00.200
What if someone shows up who can help?

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:03.787
Who's coming, Bill?
The door-to-door MRI salesman?

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:08.250
There wasn't anything to cure this
before the world fell apart.

00:52:09.084 --> 00:52:10.836
I've made up my mind.

00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:17.592
Bill.

00:52:21.555 --> 00:52:22.597
Bill.

00:52:29.896 --> 00:52:31.022
Come here.

00:52:44.244 --> 00:52:45.704
Well, I'm not gonna give you the

00:52:45.787 --> 00:52:48.248
"every day was a wonderful gift from God"
speech.

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:50.876
I've had a lot of bad days.

00:52:51.918 --> 00:52:53.837
I've had bad days with you, too.

00:52:56.423 --> 00:53:01.344
But I've had more good days with you
than with anyone else.

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:05.056
Just give me one more good day.

00:53:09.227 --> 00:53:10.687
Starting now. Make me some toast.

00:53:14.733 --> 00:53:18.153
Then take me to the boutique,

00:53:18.945 --> 00:53:21.489
where I'll pick outfits for us.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.909
You'll wear what I ask,

00:53:26.953 --> 00:53:28.705
and we'll get married.

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:33.251
And you'll cook a delicious dinner.

00:53:37.005 --> 00:53:38.924
Then you will crush all of these up,

00:53:39.674 --> 00:53:41.593
put them in my wine.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.556
I will drink it.

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:50.894
Then you will take me by my hand,

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:53.647
bring me to our bed,

00:53:57.525 --> 00:53:59.861
and I will fall asleep in your arms.

00:54:14.501 --> 00:54:16.127
I can't.

00:54:19.297 --> 00:54:20.632
Do you love me?

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:26.638
Yes.

00:54:29.975 --> 00:54:32.310
Then love me the way I want you to.

00:54:56.418 --> 00:54:58.837
MAIN ST

00:55:01.256 --> 00:55:03.800
MAIN ST

00:56:48.863 --> 00:56:50.740
BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES

00:59:01.454 --> 00:59:02.997
Will it be enough?

00:59:05.333 --> 00:59:06.334
Yeah.

00:59:51.796 --> 00:59:54.716
Were there already pills in the bottle?

00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:57.927
Enough to kill a horse.

01:00:00.054 --> 01:00:03.224
This isn't the tragic suicide
at the end of the play.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:05.059
I'm old.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:09.439
I'm satisfied.

01:00:12.817 --> 01:00:15.361
And you were my purpose.

01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:27.040
I do not support this.

01:00:28.624 --> 01:00:30.543
I should be furious.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.507
But from an objective point of view,

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.847
it's incredibly romantic.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.865
Take me to bed.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.145
WELCOME TO LINCOLN
SETTLED IN 1764

01:02:22.488 --> 01:02:24.031
Stay there.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:31.205
DANGER
HIGH VOLTAGE

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:13.206
-What the fuck?
-Bill?

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.418
Frank?

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:25.426
You stay there.
Ya hear anything, you see anything,

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.178
yell.

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:29.639
What if they're gone?

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:23.734
Ellie?

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:34.203
It's from Bill.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:42.712
"To whomever, but probably Joel."

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:46.257
I figured I fell under "whomever."

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.093
Came with this.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:00.563
So they're dead?

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.740
You wanna?

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:14.535
Go ahead. You do it.

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:22.793
"August 29, 2023.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:27.298
"If you find this,
please do not come into the bedroom.

01:05:27.965 --> 01:05:30.635
"We left a window open
so the house wouldn't smell,

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.637
"but it will probably be a sight.

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:34.972
"I'm guessing you found this, Joel,

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.058
"because anyone else
would've been electrocuted

01:05:37.141 --> 01:05:41.687
"or blown up by one of my traps.
Hehehehehehehehe.

01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:45.691
"Take anything you need.

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:49.111
"The bunker code is the same
as the gate code but in reverse.

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:52.823
"Anyway, I never liked you,

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:56.827
"but still,
it's like we're friends, almost.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.913
"And I respect you.

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.749
"So, I'm gonna tell you something
because you're probably

01:06:01.832 --> 01:06:04.168
"the only person who will understand.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:08.339
"I used to hate the world
and I was happy when everyone died.

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:15.137
"But I was wrong, because there was
one person worth saving.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:17.765
"That's what I did.

01:06:18.432 --> 01:06:19.767
"I saved him.

01:06:20.267 --> 01:06:21.811
"Then I protected him.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.189
"That's why men like you and me are here.

01:06:25.272 --> 01:06:27.024
"We have a job to do,

01:06:27.608 --> 01:06:30.945
"and God help any motherfuckers
who stand in our way.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:35.741
"I leave you all of my weapons
and equipment.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.785
Use them to keep--"

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:53.467
TO KEEP TESS SAFE

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:01.142
Stay here.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.591
SULF

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.021
Show me your arm.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.909
I just finished makin' a truck battery.

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:43.994
It's charging right now.

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:46.455
-Okay.
-And I have a brother out in Wyoming.

01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:49.500
He's in some kinda trouble,
and I'm heading out there to find him.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.044
He used to be a Firefly.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.172
And my guess is he knows
where some of them are out there.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:57.466
Maybe they can get you
to wherever this lab is.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:58.676
All right.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.513
Listen, about Tess.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.770
If I'm takin' you with me,
there's some rules you gotta follow.

01:09:10.896 --> 01:09:13.107
Rule one, you don't bring up Tess. Ever.

01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:16.402
Matter of fact, we can just
keep our histories to ourselves.

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:19.321
Rule two,
you don't tell anyone about your

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:21.448
condition.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.159
They see that bite mark,
they won't think it through.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:25.911
They'll just shoot you.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:29.123
Rule three,
you do what I say when I say it.

01:09:29.206 --> 01:09:30.875
-We clear?
-Yes.

01:09:30.958 --> 01:09:32.167
Repeat it.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.338
What you say goes.

01:09:44.972 --> 01:09:46.056
Okay.

01:09:50.561 --> 01:09:51.604
So what now?

01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:55.107
We grab what we can.

01:10:04.658 --> 01:10:08.412
Ho-ly shit.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:12.374
This guy was a genius.

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:15.920
Why was the music on?

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:18.923
If he didn't reset the countdown
every few weeks,

01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:21.926
this playlist would run over the radio.

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.302
'80s.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:26.847
Grab some cans from over there.

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:30.267
Nothin' dented or swollen.

01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:33.938
-Dude.
-No.

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:37.942
There's a wall of them.

01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:59.255
WOMAN'S SHIRTS
SM - MED

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:04.510
ALL PURPOSE
CHARGER

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:06.178
Needs another hour.

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:08.639
They have hot water!

01:11:08.722 --> 01:11:10.182
I'm takin' a shower.

01:11:10.265 --> 01:11:11.850
And then you're showering

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:13.477
because seriously.

01:11:58.605 --> 01:11:59.732
Oh shit.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.569
Well, don't you look pretty.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:05.195
Shut up.

01:12:07.072 --> 01:12:07.990
Nice.

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:33.724
-It's your first time in a car?
-It's like a spaceship.

01:12:33.807 --> 01:12:35.726
No, it's like a piece of shit Chevy S10,

01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:38.854
but it'll get us there, I think.

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:40.731
Seatbelt.

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:48.489
Seatbelt.

01:12:50.282 --> 01:12:51.784
So cool.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.381
Would ya leave it?

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:08.509
Put it back.

01:13:08.592 --> 01:13:09.510
Ellie.

01:13:14.681 --> 01:13:15.557
Oh, no, wait.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:17.059
No, leave it. Leave it.

01:13:17.142 --> 01:13:19.228
This is good. This is Linda Ronstadt.

01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:20.771
Do you know who Linda Ronstadt is?

01:13:20.854 --> 01:13:22.773
You know I don't know
who Linda Ronstadt is.

01:13:30.697 --> 01:13:32.032
Oh, man.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.328
It's better than nothing.
