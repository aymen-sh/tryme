09:06.980 --> 09:09.400
<b><i>What the hell was that goal?</i></b>

09:10.290 --> 09:11.950

09:13.030 --> 09:15.850
<b><i>None of us could handle Shidou,</i></b>

09:16.270 --> 09:20.410

09:21.250 --> 09:24.170

09:24.940 --> 09:28.800
<b><i>Shidou's definitely in a "flow" state now.</i></b>

09:29.930 --> 09:31.120

09:31.480 --> 09:36.430

<b><i>This is our last substitution.</i></b>

14:00.250 --> 14:03.460
<b><i>This is Ego putting his faith in us

<b><i>No, you're the type who wants
