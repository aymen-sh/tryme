00:05.770 --> 00:06.700
<b>Xin!</b>

00:07.950 --> 00:11.230
<b>Such power...!</b>

00:11.230 --> 00:14.860
<b>Oh? Block my strike, will you?</b>

00:14.860 --> 00:15.900
<b>Xin...</b>

00:19.390 --> 00:22.780
<b>Cavalry, too? Who <i>are</i> these guys?</b>

00:22.780 --> 00:25.510
<b>Retreat! Lady tactician's orders!</b>

00:25.510 --> 00:26.750
<b>Fall back for now!</b>

00:32.170 --> 00:34.430
<b>Stand your ground, Fei Xin Force!</b>

00:34.430 --> 00:36.500
<b>Say <i>what</i>?</b>

00:37.270 --> 00:39.850
<b>It's too dangerous 
to show 'em our backs now!</b>

00:39.850 --> 00:43.540
<b>When we're surrounded, we cover 
each other's backs--and we fight!</b>

00:43.540 --> 00:47.360
<b>Stand firm! Chu Shui's cavalry'll 
be ridin' in from behind!</b>

00:47.830 --> 00:49.590
<b>Then we'll regroup</b>

00:49.590 --> 00:53.450
<b>and crush every last one of these 
cocky trap-settin' bastards!</b>

00:53.450 --> 00:56.060
<b>Until then, dig in your heels, gang!</b>

00:57.980 --> 00:59.700
<b>Regroup, eh?</b>

00:59.990 --> 01:02.840
<b>You think you have the luxury of regrouping?</b>

01:05.830 --> 01:08.080
<b>Zhao</b>

01:08.090 --> 01:10.080
<b>What's that?</b>

01:10.080 --> 01:12.340
<b>Listen up, Qin imbeciles.</b>

01:12.340 --> 01:15.840
<b>Let me share with you the words 
of our general, Ji Hui:</b>

01:15.840 --> 01:17.650
<b>Here in Heiyong,</b>

01:18.560 --> 01:21.770
<b>he who confounds his enemy 
will be victorious.</b>

01:23.090 --> 01:23.840
<b>Wha--</b>

01:24.220 --> 01:27.040
<b>They took one of our hills?!</b>

02:58.570 --> 03:01.740
<b>The Stench of the Battlefield</b>

02:59.330 --> 03:03.390
<b>There, boss... smoke on one 
of the hills on our side.</b>

03:03.390 --> 03:06.020
<b>The Fei Xin Force should have passed it by,</b>

03:06.020 --> 03:09.050
<b>and it feels too soon for the 
right flank to have taken it.</b>

03:09.420 --> 03:12.130
<b>Is that even one of our signals?</b>

03:12.130 --> 03:15.250
<b>That idiotic servant.</b>

03:20.600 --> 03:22.080
<b>Go, Xin!</b>

03:22.080 --> 03:24.400
<b>Take down that big fella!</b>

03:24.400 --> 03:25.790
<b>Is his horse gonna hold up?</b>

03:26.950 --> 03:28.130
<b>General!</b>

03:28.950 --> 03:29.840
<b>General?</b>

03:38.200 --> 03:39.450
<b>I'm surprised.</b>

03:39.450 --> 03:42.210
<b>Not even Liu Dong can take 
a blow from my battle-axe,</b>

03:42.210 --> 03:44.460
<b>and here you've done it twice.</b>

03:44.460 --> 03:46.360
<b>Xin!</b>

03:49.320 --> 03:50.990
<b>It's Lieutenant Chu Shui!</b>

03:50.990 --> 03:52.290
<b>Excellent!</b>

03:52.560 --> 03:54.990
<b>I believe that's enough, sir...</b>

03:56.200 --> 03:57.510
<b>I am Mǎ Cheng.</b>

03:57.830 --> 04:02.470
<b>I never thought I'd suddenly be trading 
blows with the quarry himself.</b>

04:03.010 --> 04:05.480
<b>Such a fine opportunity... 
but our time is up.</b>

04:05.940 --> 04:09.930
<b>Look forward to our next meeting--
I'll be bringing a proper army.</b>

04:10.090 --> 04:12.350
<b>Xin of the Fei Xin Force.</b>

04:12.960 --> 04:14.370
<b>See you later.</b>

04:14.370 --> 04:14.920
<b>Wha--?!</b>

04:15.750 --> 04:18.970
<b>Are you kiddin' me? So I just 
stand here and let you run?!</b>

04:18.970 --> 04:20.340
<b>Wait, Xin!</b>

04:21.060 --> 04:25.240
<b>Leave pursuit to Chu Shui's unit! 
We have bigger fish to fry!</b>

04:27.160 --> 04:28.610
<b>Our problem right now</b>

04:28.900 --> 04:30.490
<b>is in <i>that</i> direction.</b>

04:31.220 --> 04:37.270
<b>Quite bold of you to use both adjutants 
right out of the gate, Ji Hui.</b>

04:37.640 --> 04:43.630
<b>To fight in Heiyong, it's vital that we
do whatever it takes to seize the initiative.</b>

04:43.630 --> 04:47.540
<b>But you have much to lose if you fail.</b>

04:47.540 --> 04:49.590
<b>I take it you're a gambling man?</b>

04:49.870 --> 04:51.400
<b>This is no gamble.</b>

04:52.110 --> 04:56.940
<b>I am confident in Mǎ Cheng and 
Liu Dong--and in their might.</b>

04:57.250 --> 05:00.380
<b>Zhao</b>

04:57.500 --> 05:00.390
<b>Liu Dong, sir! Preparations are complete!</b>

05:02.580 --> 05:05.740
<b>Are we really going to 
take that hill alone?!</b>

05:06.180 --> 05:07.940
<b>That elevation...</b>

05:07.940 --> 05:12.620
<b>We'll be hit with a barrage of arrows and rocks
from above while we're still climbing!</b>

05:12.620 --> 05:15.740
<b>And we have no idea how 
many enemies there are!</b>

05:16.310 --> 05:20.000
<b>The unit on the hilltop is a
small one--that much is certain.</b>

05:21.240 --> 05:25.760
<b>They probably used river 
tributaries we don't know about</b>

05:25.760 --> 05:27.680
<b>to get this far in.</b>

05:28.530 --> 05:32.420
<b>That's definitely nothing 
a bigger army unit could do.</b>

05:33.010 --> 05:36.170
<b>And the Fei Xin Force can
 handle a small unit,</b>

05:36.170 --> 05:38.220
<b>even if the enemy has the high ground.</b>

05:38.650 --> 05:41.460
<b>Still, it doesn't mean 
we'll get out unscathed.</b>

05:41.460 --> 05:42.580
<b>I know.</b>

05:42.950 --> 05:44.740
<b>But if we don't do it now,</b>

05:44.740 --> 05:47.760
<b>the enemy will gather on that hill 
and turn it into a stronghold--</b>

05:47.760 --> 05:50.570
<b>and we'll need a big army for <i>that</i> battle.</b>

05:53.150 --> 05:55.780
<b>So if we're gonna take it, 
it's gotta be now.</b>

05:56.230 --> 05:57.160
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

05:57.160 --> 05:59.700
<b>But how do we take the hill?</b>

06:00.050 --> 06:01.300
<b>Don't worry.</b>

06:01.740 --> 06:04.660
<b>Simple tactics will do the trick.</b>

06:04.970 --> 06:06.180
<b>Listen up!</b>

06:06.180 --> 06:09.010
<b>I want ranks of shields 
without a single gap!</b>

06:09.010 --> 06:13.050
<b>We face the rain of arrows 
head-on and keep on climbing!</b>

06:13.670 --> 06:15.550
<b>We gonna do this?</b>

06:16.270 --> 06:18.220
<b>Are we gonna do this?</b>

06:19.690 --> 06:21.520
<b>Then let's go!</b>

06:21.820 --> 06:23.880
<b>The hill's bigger than we thought.</b>

06:23.880 --> 06:26.550
<b>The enemy can't defend it all
with just a small unit.</b>

06:26.550 --> 06:30.110
<b>So Tian Yǒu will shout and make a big 
show of advancing right up the front.</b>

06:30.110 --> 06:31.940
<b>The arrows should be coming soon!</b>

06:31.940 --> 06:32.770
<b>Shields up!</b>

06:32.770 --> 06:34.560
<b>Meanwhile,</b>

06:35.240 --> 06:38.010
<b>a nimble squad led by
 Xin and Chong Yuan</b>

06:38.010 --> 06:41.380
<b>will scramble up the back
out of the enemy's sight.</b>

06:41.980 --> 06:46.820
<b>Nice. The enemy is totally distracted 
by Tian Yǒu's guys on the front.</b>

06:55.180 --> 06:57.560
<b>Hold up--sentries.</b>

06:57.820 --> 07:00.820
<b>Ten... maybe twenty of 'em.</b>

07:02.860 --> 07:05.560
<b>No other sentries around us.</b>

07:08.560 --> 07:10.390
<b>We can circle right and go around 'em.</b>

07:11.380 --> 07:13.920
<b>I'll keep to this path.</b>

07:14.160 --> 07:16.110
<b>All right. Here goes.</b>

07:23.770 --> 07:27.110
<b>Zhao</b>

07:27.890 --> 07:28.840
<b>Ready?</b>

07:31.240 --> 07:31.930
<b>Go!</b>

07:37.610 --> 07:39.360
<b>What the hell?!</b>

07:43.150 --> 07:46.730
<b>Wh-What gives? We haven't 
seen a single arrow.</b>

07:47.840 --> 07:49.680
<b>What did I tell you?</b>

07:50.160 --> 07:53.390
<b>Heiyong is all about confounding your foe.</b>

07:53.720 --> 07:56.050
<b>Zhao</b>

07:56.280 --> 07:57.950
<b>Son of a bitch...!</b>

07:58.390 --> 08:02.550
<b>Once he had reached the 
summit, Xin realized</b>

08:02.550 --> 08:06.520
<b>the two units that had come out of 
nowhere had played him like a violin.</b>

08:06.840 --> 08:13.720
<b>Central Hill / Fei Xin Force</b>

08:07.170 --> 08:09.510
<b>Believing that the hill was occupied,</b>

08:09.510 --> 08:13.640
<b>the Fei Xin Force changed their route 
and made moves to capture it.</b>

08:13.720 --> 08:27.980
<b>Zhao</b>

08:13.720 --> 08:27.980
<b>Central Hill</b>

08:13.720 --> 08:27.980
<b>Mǎ Cheng's & Liu Dong's Units</b>

08:13.720 --> 08:27.980
<b>Fei Xin Force</b>

08:13.720 --> 08:27.980
<b>Qin</b>

08:14.170 --> 08:17.940
<b>This spoiled their strategy 
of being the first to create</b>

08:17.940 --> 08:20.840
<b>a front line beyond the central hill,</b>

08:21.300 --> 08:25.000
<b>allowing the Zhao army 
to reach the central hill first</b>

08:25.000 --> 08:27.730
<b>and set up a front line on the near side.</b>

08:28.460 --> 08:31.730
<b>While Xin was climbing the hill,</b>

08:31.760 --> 08:34.720
<b>Central Hill / Fei Xin Force</b>

08:32.080 --> 08:36.970
<b>Qiang Lei's unit, sent ahead 
as Fei Xin Force scouts...</b>

08:38.580 --> 08:39.580
<b>What's this?</b>

08:40.540 --> 08:44.300
<b>So Heiyong's not just a sea of trees...</b>

08:45.560 --> 08:46.950
<b>Right after we arrived,</b>

08:47.720 --> 08:50.350
<b>I spotted those wisps of smoke.</b>

08:50.350 --> 08:53.180
<b>So they <i>were</i> signs of human life.</b>

08:54.460 --> 08:55.830
<b>In which case...</b>

08:56.400 --> 08:58.600
<b>there'll be other settlements, too.</b>

08:58.970 --> 09:00.340
<b>Wait a second.</b>

09:00.720 --> 09:04.090
<b>Why are they so carefree, 
tending their fields?</b>

09:04.900 --> 09:07.770
<b>All those kids playing outside...</b>

09:07.770 --> 09:11.780
<b>Do they have no idea 
they're on the brink of war?</b>

09:12.100 --> 09:15.910
<b>Even Qin is home to a number of 
these remote back-country places</b>

09:15.910 --> 09:18.390
<b>that barely seem part of 
the country at large.</b>

09:18.390 --> 09:22.710
<b>I wouldn't be surprised if news of the war 
hadn't reached this dense forest.</b>

09:24.160 --> 09:26.240
<b>Let's keep going, Qiang Lei.</b>

09:26.240 --> 09:28.570
<b>This is their problem.</b>

09:28.570 --> 09:32.840
<b>Harsh as it may sound, 
this doesn't concern us right now.</b>

09:36.590 --> 09:38.610
<b>How can it not?</b>

09:39.800 --> 09:40.710
<b>Lieutenant?</b>

09:40.710 --> 09:44.140
<b>Huang Bing, go notify Xin 
about the settlement.</b>

09:44.140 --> 09:45.570
<b>Y-Yes, ma'am!</b>

09:46.150 --> 09:48.110
<b>The rest of you, stay on guard.</b>

09:48.110 --> 09:50.350
<b>I'll go warn them.</b>

09:50.350 --> 09:52.070
<b>Don't do it, Qiang Lei!</b>

09:52.070 --> 09:55.650
<b>We're nothing but invaders to them!</b>

09:55.650 --> 09:58.070
<b>I'm coming right back.</b>

09:58.570 --> 09:59.860
<b>I told you:</b>

10:00.700 --> 10:04.280
<b>This war is getting complicated, Xin.</b>

10:05.400 --> 10:09.100
<b>Not long after this commotion 
on the righthand side,</b>

10:09.100 --> 10:11.860
<b>the left battlefield, too, 
sprang into action.</b>

10:16.110 --> 10:20.750
<b>D-Does Huan Yi's army always 
march this fast, Ba Yin?</b>

10:20.750 --> 10:21.770
<b>Huh?</b>

10:22.110 --> 10:26.470
<b>It's just... we move even faster 
than this sometimes, but...</b>

10:27.530 --> 10:30.770
<b>Nah, we're not always this speedy.</b>

10:30.770 --> 10:33.940
<b>But this time--well, I don't 
know the specifics,</b>

10:33.960 --> 10:40.300
<b>Central Hill / Lei Tu's Army // Qin</b>

10:34.380 --> 10:37.030
<b>but Lei Tu's army is rushing ahead first</b>

10:37.030 --> 10:39.910
<b>to set up a front line 
past the central hill.</b>

10:40.330 --> 10:43.100
<b>And we're Lei Tu's army?</b>

10:43.100 --> 10:46.000
<b>You got it. Lei Tu's army, second file.</b>

10:46.490 --> 10:47.670
<b>Lei Tu...</b>

10:48.090 --> 10:52.400
<b>That scary guy with the tattoo 
around his left eye?</b>

10:53.050 --> 10:56.800
<b>Oh, Lei Tu's scary all right.
Crazy strong, too.</b>

10:53.060 --> 10:56.780
<b>Huan</b>

10:57.280 --> 11:02.250
<b>The boss had a hell of a time reelin' in 
his gang, I tell you what.</b>

11:02.250 --> 11:04.850
<b>His gang? Reeling in?</b>

11:04.850 --> 11:08.340
<b>Geez, you don't even know <i>that</i> much?</b>

11:09.180 --> 11:12.750
<b>Right now we're all one 
united army under Huan Yi,</b>

11:12.750 --> 11:16.500
<b>but we used to be separate bandit gangs.</b>

11:16.500 --> 11:21.670
<b>One by one, the boss either crushed 'em 
or persuaded 'em to come work for him.</b>

11:21.670 --> 11:23.540
<b>That's how we wound up so big.</b>

11:23.540 --> 11:25.410
<b>Wow...</b>

11:25.670 --> 11:30.610
<b>And we're in a squad under Lei Tu, 
the most fearsome of them all?</b>

11:31.030 --> 11:32.750
<b>Something like that.</b>

11:32.750 --> 11:35.000
<b>But see, there are two other groups</b>

11:35.000 --> 11:36.980
<b>that are serious bad news.</b>

11:36.980 --> 11:39.060
<b>One is the Ze Nuo Gang.</b>

11:39.060 --> 11:42.070
<b>They're running alongside us, 
through the shrubs on our left.</b>

11:42.070 --> 11:45.170
<b>They used to be a menacing 
gang of bandits up north,</b>

11:45.170 --> 11:48.490
<b>so fierce you'd think they
were really just berserkers.</b>

11:48.490 --> 11:50.450
<b>Those dudes are 
<i>crazy</i> about warfare.</b>

11:50.560 --> 11:51.930
<b>O... kay...</b>

11:51.930 --> 11:55.870
<b>They definitely have the most 
military might in Huan Yi's army,</b>

11:55.870 --> 11:58.310
<b>and they'll happily leap
into the jaws of death.</b>

11:59.130 --> 12:01.800
<b>Especially their leader, Ze Nuo.</b>

12:01.800 --> 12:06.200
<b>He's this huge beast of a guy who can 
twist off an ox's head with one hand.</b>

12:06.680 --> 12:11.270
<b>I saw Meng Wu once,
and Ze Nuo would tower over him!</b>

12:11.270 --> 12:12.000
<b>What?!</b>

12:12.520 --> 12:17.950
<b>The Ze Nuo Gang always kicks in the 
most whenever strength is called for.</b>

12:17.950 --> 12:20.010
<b>There's just one big problem.</b>

12:20.460 --> 12:25.730
<b>Those guys? They're savage beasts! 
Their bloodlust is <i>constant</i>.</b>

12:25.730 --> 12:29.020
<b>If they don't like you, they'll tear you to 
shreds--even if you're on their side.</b>

12:30.850 --> 12:34.320
<b>Hell, even the boss stays clear of Ze Nuo.</b>

12:34.320 --> 12:37.020
<b>So don't go wandering over 
to the left side, hear me?</b>

12:37.020 --> 12:41.530
<b>O-Okay, fellas, if we get 
separated, do <i>not</i> head left!</b>

12:43.770 --> 12:48.150
<b>The other group is the one 
behind us right now:</b>

12:48.150 --> 12:49.510
<b>the Shagui Gang.</b>

12:49.510 --> 12:50.980
<b>The Shagui... Gang?</b>

12:50.980 --> 12:56.930
<b>They're the most brutal group in
Huan Yi's army. Enough said, I assume?</b>

12:57.240 --> 13:01.790
<b>Like, they get off on impaling 
living people on stakes.</b>

13:01.790 --> 13:04.020
<b>Those guys are total whackjobs.</b>

13:04.560 --> 13:07.640
<b>They say the greatest misfortune 
in the whole Middle Kingdom</b>

13:07.640 --> 13:09.480
<b>is to be captured by the Shagui.</b>

13:10.320 --> 13:12.720
<b>A-All right, fellas, keep moving!</b>

13:12.720 --> 13:15.490
<b>Don't slow down on me, now!</b>

13:16.880 --> 13:18.140
<b>Hey, Wei Ping...</b>

13:18.710 --> 13:23.440
<b>They <i>will</i> let us go back to the 
Fei Xin Force when this is over, right?</b>

13:23.440 --> 13:24.680
<b>They should.</b>

13:25.060 --> 13:27.100
<b>I was drunk, so my memory's kinda foggy,</b>

13:27.100 --> 13:29.270
<b>but I'm pretty sure that's 
what they said...</b>

13:36.700 --> 13:39.140
<b>G-General Huan Yi!</b>

13:39.650 --> 13:42.410
<b>Boss! What are you doing out here?!</b>

13:42.410 --> 13:44.970
<b>Are you Lei Tu's second file?</b>

13:44.970 --> 13:46.300
<b>Y-Yes, sir!</b>

13:46.300 --> 13:49.200
<b>One more to the left, Li Yu.</b>

13:49.200 --> 13:50.180
<b>Looks like.</b>

13:50.180 --> 13:54.940
<b>Is something wrong?
To come all this way yourself...</b>

13:54.940 --> 13:57.430
<b>Ah, well... you know.</b>

13:57.740 --> 14:00.950
<b>That servant on the right 
already screwed up.</b>

14:00.950 --> 14:02.060
<b>Huh?</b>

14:02.390 --> 14:03.640
<b>Let's go.</b>

14:03.640 --> 14:04.800
<b>Right.</b>

14:07.980 --> 14:11.530
<b>Lieutenant Ji Hui's gamble paid off.</b>

14:11.530 --> 14:17.160
<b>Things should go smoothly thanks to the 
efforts of his two adjutants. I'm grateful.</b>

14:17.300 --> 14:19.420
<b>Your flattery is unconvincing, Yue Ying.</b>

14:19.420 --> 14:24.590
<b>Your short stature means good visibility 
for me. I'm grateful for that, too.</b>

14:24.590 --> 14:26.170
<b>Listen, Yue Ying...</b>

14:26.410 --> 14:29.830
<b>That's one outstanding feat 
you've pulled off, Ji Hui.</b>

14:29.830 --> 14:32.190
<b>All credit to Mǎ Cheng and Liu Dong.</b>

14:35.130 --> 14:36.010
<b>Look.</b>

14:36.010 --> 14:42.650
<b>The central hill--the largest in Heiyong,
and the one that will decide this battle.</b>

14:42.760 --> 14:44.940
<b>The left does not worry me.</b>

14:45.120 --> 14:48.230
<b>As we advance, be wary 
of the right alone.</b>

14:48.530 --> 14:51.170
<b>That central hill will be ours.</b>

14:59.850 --> 15:03.760
<b>Y-You sure about diving in like this, boss?</b>

15:03.760 --> 15:05.060
<b>I'm sure.</b>

15:05.600 --> 15:07.260
<b>Hey, what's the big idea?!</b>

15:07.260 --> 15:09.130
<b>Don't you know who our boss--</b>

15:09.130 --> 15:10.220
<b>Out of my way.</b>

15:10.340 --> 15:13.480
<b>Boss, we're not supposed to
mow <i>them</i> down!</b>

15:15.100 --> 15:17.600
<b>N-No, stop! We're allies, you morons!</b>

15:17.930 --> 15:21.140
<b>I see <i>your</i> crew hasn't changed one bit.</b>

15:22.050 --> 15:24.600
<b>Got a job for you, Ze Nuo.</b>

15:24.870 --> 15:29.140
<b>Use your brawn to tear up 
the Heiyong playing field.</b>

15:30.240 --> 15:31.940
<b>Huan Yi...</b>

15:33.490 --> 15:34.920
<b>You're not getting past us!</b>

15:38.060 --> 15:40.040
<b>All right--we're through!</b>

15:40.970 --> 15:43.030
<b>There! In that clearing!</b>

15:43.030 --> 15:45.010
<b>Crap, it's an ambush!</b>

15:47.430 --> 15:49.890
<b>Xin! We need to withdraw!</b>

15:49.890 --> 15:51.620
<b>We can't go any further here!</b>

15:52.880 --> 15:54.370
<b>Dammit!</b>

15:54.370 --> 15:58.090
<b>The Fei Xin Force struggled with 
the skillful guerilla tactics</b>

15:55.260 --> 16:00.430
<b>Mǎ Cheng's & Liu Dong's Units / Fei Xin Force</b>

15:58.090 --> 16:00.610
<b>of their foes, Mǎ Cheng and Liu Dong,</b>

16:00.610 --> 16:02.950
<b>and were unable to push 
back the front line.</b>

16:03.510 --> 16:06.490
<b>The vanguard of Zhao's main army</b>

16:06.400 --> 16:11.900
<b>Zhao Central Army Vanguard / Central Hill</b>

16:06.490 --> 16:11.470
<b>had already come to within a hair's 
breadth of the central hill.</b>

16:12.490 --> 16:14.910
<b>We're not to climb it yet?</b>

16:19.480 --> 16:25.040
<b>I get it. An army is at its most vulnerable 
while clearing a path to the summit.</b>

16:25.560 --> 16:30.840
<b>The main camp can wait until
 the vanguard has set up a stronghold.</b>

16:30.840 --> 16:35.680
<b>That's true, but right now, the enemy's 
not breathing down our necks.</b>

16:36.120 --> 16:39.790
<b>This gentleman is more 
cautious than I'd expected.</b>

16:39.790 --> 16:41.990
<b>It's not out of caution.</b>

16:43.190 --> 16:46.600
<b>I simply haven't smelled Huan Yi's
 stench at the bottom yet.</b>

16:49.420 --> 16:51.280
<b>I-I see...</b>

16:59.600 --> 17:00.830
<b>There we go.</b>

17:08.460 --> 17:10.500
<b>He's a monster!</b>

17:11.010 --> 17:15.460
<b>Lei Tu, sir, the Ze Nuo Gang 
is gonna steal our thunder!</b>

17:16.110 --> 17:20.380
<b>Still, if the boss is 
using Ze Nuo already...</b>

17:22.850 --> 17:26.690
<b>I-Is the second file going to charge, too?</b>

17:26.690 --> 17:28.260
<b>We sure are!</b>

17:28.270 --> 17:32.780
<b>Central Hill / Lei Tu / Ze Nuo / Wei Ping</b>

17:28.530 --> 17:32.280
<b>The Ze Nuo Gang and Lei Tu 
are off to smash the enemy front!</b>

17:33.270 --> 17:35.780
<b>We're tagging along to join the fray!</b>

17:35.780 --> 17:37.340
<b>Then we'd better hurry and--</b>

17:37.340 --> 17:38.750
<b>Hey! A hill!</b>

17:38.750 --> 17:40.000
<b>That's the one?!</b>

17:40.000 --> 17:43.240
<b>Wait--it's huge! That there is a <i>mountain</i>!</b>

17:43.240 --> 17:46.250
<b>It's huge, all right.
That's why it's so dangerous.</b>

17:46.940 --> 17:52.390
<b>Us former bandits worked in the 
mountains, see. We know our stuff.</b>

17:52.390 --> 17:57.380
<b>If they turn that thing into a stronghold,
we won't stand a chance!</b>

17:57.600 --> 18:02.890
<b>The boss used Ze Nuo, his ace in the hole,
to stop that from happening.</b>

18:04.580 --> 18:09.880
<b>We <i>gotta</i> keep the Zhao army 
from conquerin' that hill!</b>

18:10.310 --> 18:11.710
<b>Urgent report!</b>

18:11.710 --> 18:13.470
<b>The right flank's front line collapsed!</b>

18:13.470 --> 18:15.740
<b>The enemy seems to have broken through!</b>

18:16.930 --> 18:19.490
<b>The front line collapsed?! 
They broke through?</b>

18:19.800 --> 18:22.690
<b>But our right wing is 20 thousand strong!</b>

18:23.380 --> 18:26.380
<b>To break through enemy lines
in this dense forest,</b>

18:26.380 --> 18:29.360
<b>they'd need significantly superior might.</b>

18:29.820 --> 18:35.140
<b>Huan Yi must have sent out his
mightiest squad. And their target...</b>

18:35.140 --> 18:36.500
<b>Qing She, sir!</b>

18:36.770 --> 18:39.010
<b>Report from the central vanguard!</b>

18:39.530 --> 18:42.100
<b>Preparations to climb 
the hill are complete!</b>

18:42.480 --> 18:47.430
<b>Qing She, sir... Please call off 
the vanguard's ascent for now.</b>

18:48.690 --> 18:51.380
<b>The enemy's broken through the right front;</b>

18:51.380 --> 18:54.860
<b>they'll surely target the 
squad's flanks on its way up.</b>

18:55.030 --> 19:00.030
<b>Central Hill</b>

18:55.360 --> 18:59.610
<b>Taking any hits along the way 
will result in massive losses.</b>

19:02.580 --> 19:03.970
<b>Qing She, sir?</b>

19:03.970 --> 19:06.280
<b>I did not ask for your opinion, Ji Hui.</b>

19:07.500 --> 19:10.880
<b>Do not get between me and Huan Yi today.</b>

19:11.400 --> 19:13.920
<b>Have the vanguard make
a stronghold of the hill.</b>

19:13.920 --> 19:14.770
<b>Sir!</b>

19:14.770 --> 19:16.720
<b>Another report!</b>

19:16.720 --> 19:18.900
<b>The enemy that broke 
through our right front</b>

19:18.900 --> 19:21.090
<b>is about to break through 
our reserves, too!</b>

19:21.090 --> 19:24.430
<b>They're on pace to storm the central hill!</b>

19:27.900 --> 19:31.600
<b>The Zhao army began advancing 
on the central hill.</b>

19:34.520 --> 19:35.410
<b>Tch!</b>

19:35.700 --> 19:39.330
<b>They actually started climbing! 
The nerve of that lot!</b>

19:39.330 --> 19:42.310
<b>Ze Nuo, we have to secure 
a route to the right!</b>

19:42.310 --> 19:46.410
<b>We'll tear into the flanks of those 
ding-dongs dawdling at the base!</b>

19:46.410 --> 19:48.920
<b>Your job here, Lei Tu...</b>

19:48.920 --> 19:52.420
<b>is to guide my brawn.</b>

20:02.130 --> 20:03.140
<b>Halt!</b>

20:20.730 --> 20:25.980
<b>Oho... That Qing She fellow
is going hard, too.</b>

20:26.890 --> 20:30.210
<b>The most terrifying part of war</b>

20:30.690 --> 20:33.710
<b>is when you think you hold the upper hand,</b>

20:33.710 --> 20:37.760
<b>only to find yourself suddenly 
staring into the jaws of death.</b>

20:37.760 --> 20:42.260
<b>Am I getting through to you, 
you backwoods apes?</b>

20:42.650 --> 20:44.850
<b>Yeah... loud and clear.</b>

20:45.710 --> 20:48.550
<b>You're sayin' you're a damn fool!</b>

21:00.670 --> 21:03.860
<b>Yue Ying seems to have 
clashed with the enemy.</b>

21:03.900 --> 21:08.650
<b>Is he all right? Those are no ordinary 
enemies closing in on them.</b>

21:08.860 --> 21:10.900
<b>Yue Ying will be fine.</b>

21:10.900 --> 21:14.370
<b>It's 10 thousand times safer
than that wager of yours.</b>

21:15.170 --> 21:16.330
<b>Besides...</b>

21:16.330 --> 21:20.810
<b>Qing She himself has taken the field. 
Those enemies are as good as dead.</b>

21:23.890 --> 21:25.850
<b>This Qing She gentleman...</b>

21:26.880 --> 21:30.800
<b>He's even more fearsome than they say.</b>

21:31.810 --> 21:33.400
<b>How do you intend to stop them?</b>

21:33.610 --> 21:35.760
<b>I'm not going out there to stop them.</b>

21:35.760 --> 21:37.280
<b>I'm going to <i>hunt</i> them.</b>

21:39.890 --> 21:42.850
<b>The enemy's not in that direction--</b>

21:42.850 --> 21:46.110
<b>Stay there and be quiet, Ji Hui.</b>

21:46.110 --> 21:49.340
<b>I'll treat you to the sound of Huan Yin's arm</b>

21:50.330 --> 21:51.780
<b>shattering.</b>

21:55.650 --> 21:57.710
<b>O-Ow...</b>

21:59.430 --> 22:00.420
<b>Wei Ping!</b>

22:02.520 --> 22:05.040
<b>Wei Ping! Wei Ping!</b>

22:05.040 --> 22:06.490
<b>Wei Ping!</b>

22:07.190 --> 22:09.090
<b>I... I'm all right!</b>

22:09.090 --> 22:10.680
<b>Never mind me, just...</b>

22:11.390 --> 22:13.310
<b>...<i>run</i>!</b>

22:13.870 --> 22:15.560
<b>You utter trash!</b>

22:15.560 --> 22:18.820
<b>You got a lotta nerve, tryin'
a sneak attack on the Huan Yi army!</b>

22:22.820 --> 22:24.870
<b>S-So strong...</b>

22:25.250 --> 22:28.650
<b>For Huan Yi's soldiers to be 
defeated so handily...</b>

22:28.650 --> 22:30.710
<b>It's not just the surprise factor.</b>

22:30.710 --> 22:34.300
<b>This enemy unit...
It's seriously powerful!</b>

22:35.110 --> 22:37.330
<b>Well done, Qing She, sir!</b>

22:38.300 --> 22:39.580
<b>Qing She?</b>

22:39.900 --> 22:41.090
<b>Qing She?!</b>

22:41.830 --> 22:45.650
<b>Isn't Qing She the commanding 
general of the Zhao army?</b>

22:45.650 --> 22:49.830
<b>This appears to be their second file, sir.</b>

22:51.210 --> 22:55.180
<b>What on earth is their 
top general doing out <i>here</i>?</b>

22:55.990 --> 23:00.060
<b>A few more units are catching up 
from further in.</b>

23:00.250 --> 23:02.390
<b>Crush them all.</b>

23:02.390 --> 23:04.190
<b>Don't let a single squad through.</b>

23:04.580 --> 23:07.940
<b>This is where we sever their 
head from its reinforcements.</b>

23:08.300 --> 23:09.690
<b><i>Sever</i>?!</b>

23:10.210 --> 23:13.800
<b>You started this--and there's 
no going back now, Huan Yi.</b>

24:45.020 --> 24:55.000
<b>Heiyong at Night</b>
