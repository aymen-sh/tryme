00:00.780 --> 00:03.870
Naozumi, I know Yotaro's 
your little brother,

00:03.870 --> 00:06.940
but you don't <i>need</i> to put him 
at the head of the Risshidan.

00:07.490 --> 00:11.860
He can't be honest with you or his wife. 
Not even his students respect him.

00:14.870 --> 00:16.040
No, we need him.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.930
You don't know the real Yotaro.

00:19.360 --> 00:23.580
He's the only man fit to lead the Risshidan.
 He's a paragon of the sword.

00:24.390 --> 00:27.900
He's a true martial god. 
No one could ever defeat him.

00:28.540 --> 00:30.550
<b>Kyohachi School</b>

00:29.320 --> 00:30.250
Best of three!

00:31.190 --> 00:31.670
Bow!

00:33.700 --> 00:35.730
Kondo Isami of the Mibu Roshigumi

00:36.610 --> 00:39.200
versus Kyohachi Yotaro, 
head of the Kyohachi School.

00:41.610 --> 00:43.870
<i>He doesn't always have it
 together, but even so...</i>

00:45.710 --> 00:48.070
If you want to learn swordsmanship here,

00:48.070 --> 00:49.390
speak to him.

00:49.750 --> 00:50.940
Start here.

00:51.320 --> 00:51.990
End here.

00:53.430 --> 00:54.110
Begin!

00:59.380 --> 01:03.520
<i>I finally get to see how Kondo-san fights.</i>

01:16.760 --> 01:21.060
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:16.760 --> 01:21.060

<b>Blue Miburo</b>

01:16.760 --> 01:21.060
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:37.010 --> 02:37.930
They've begun.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.430
Seigan.

02:39.430 --> 02:40.470
"Say gone"?

02:40.900 --> 02:42.180
It's a basic stance.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.940
They watch to see what the other does first.

02:44.940 --> 02:46.470
O-Oh, I see.

02:46.690 --> 02:49.370
Don't you think this'll be tough
 on the young sensei?

02:49.370 --> 02:52.980
I'm worried. That fellow looks strong.

02:53.540 --> 02:57.560
<i>Not even Yotaro-san's students
 have faith in him.</i>

03:01.270 --> 03:03.040
H-He changed stance.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.020
Hajime-kun, what's that one?

03:05.020 --> 03:07.190
Stop bugging me. Shut up and watch.

03:09.030 --> 03:10.380
<i>Was that Kondo-san?</i>

03:14.820 --> 03:15.580
He attacking!

03:15.580 --> 03:16.300
<i>He's fast.</i>

03:21.930 --> 03:24.620
H-He blocked it. Thank goodness.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.920
Good luck trying to parry 
Yotaro's flurries of blows.

03:39.810 --> 03:42.440
At first sight, it's virtually impossible.

03:47.230 --> 03:48.080
He got him!

03:49.960 --> 03:50.580
No.

03:51.850 --> 03:54.570
Pops is parrying every blow.

03:55.290 --> 03:57.270
What? That <i>wasn't</i> a clean hit?

03:57.560 --> 03:58.460
Be quiet.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.210
K-Kondo-san has the edge. He's incredible.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.680
<i>So Pops has the edge in strength.</i>

04:16.820 --> 04:18.650
Point to Kyohachi.

04:18.820 --> 04:20.050
What? How?

04:20.550 --> 04:23.660
He hit his forearm. Shallow but clean.

04:23.940 --> 04:28.500
Hey, now. Is that really the young sensei? 
He's like a different person.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.040
Has he always been this good?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.840
He must be what they call a "natural."

04:35.720 --> 04:37.290
This guy's something special.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.050
You mean he's a prodigy, like Okita-san?

04:40.380 --> 04:42.850
No, a little more serious.

04:42.850 --> 04:43.930
Serious how?

04:43.930 --> 04:45.280
Round two, begin!

04:46.620 --> 04:49.560
The match is a best of three. 
It all hangs on this round.

04:52.830 --> 04:54.150
It's one-sided again.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.500
What's the matter, Kondo-san?

04:56.820 --> 04:59.160
It's over for you if you don't strike back.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.580
Kami-ashi footwork.

05:12.150 --> 05:12.910
He dodged it!

05:13.130 --> 05:14.080
<i>You're wide open!</i>

05:17.600 --> 05:19.920
P-Point. Body strike!

05:22.720 --> 05:25.680
Yes! Kondo-san took that round.

05:26.010 --> 05:28.400
H-He pushed him with his arm.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.180
What kind of swordsmanship 
is that? Is it even allowed?

05:31.440 --> 05:34.940
Idiots. There are no rules
 in a fight to the death.

05:35.820 --> 05:38.720
<i>Still, Pops is nimbler than I thought.</i>

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
A friend?

05:42.240 --> 05:44.690
What's this Kondo guy like?

05:45.280 --> 05:48.200
Good question. In short, he seeks...

05:49.620 --> 05:50.830
the "way."

05:53.630 --> 05:55.480
Thank you for giving me round two.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.480
Oh, um...

05:56.820 --> 05:57.940
A courtesy?

05:57.940 --> 05:59.080
I see.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.810
That's our sensei. Always a gentleman.

06:01.810 --> 06:03.970
<i>But I was fighting seriously.</i>

06:05.460 --> 06:08.270
Either way, this visitor is no slouch.

06:08.270 --> 06:09.610
He's the real deal.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.840
Shogoro's the best!

06:17.840 --> 06:19.600
He's never lost a fight!

06:20.160 --> 06:22.360
Did you hear he took down a boar this time?

06:22.360 --> 06:23.950
What is he, a tengu?

06:23.950 --> 06:24.950
A martial god?

06:24.950 --> 06:26.530
Bishamonten himself?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.770
This is Kondo Shusuke-sensei.

06:30.330 --> 06:32.680
He came all this way just to meet you.

06:33.390 --> 06:34.120
He's strong.

06:34.550 --> 06:38.630
What would you say to going 
a few rounds with me?

06:45.840 --> 06:48.670
Did you think you could thrash my old bones?

06:49.130 --> 06:56.140
<b>Shieikan</b>

06:49.760 --> 06:52.580
From now on, your name is Kondo Isami.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.630
And the Shieikan is your dojo.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.150
Accept all comers.

06:58.480 --> 07:02.640
This is a gathering place for 
those who wish to master the way.

07:03.180 --> 07:08.400
Hone your technique, strengthen 
your body, and temper your spirit.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.220
And never forget, Isami:

07:12.220 --> 07:14.210
You are weak.

07:14.790 --> 07:17.070
Everything begins from there.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.680
H-He's laughing?

07:26.510 --> 07:28.180
Round three, begin!

07:28.400 --> 07:29.630
The world is vast.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.040
Many strong fighters still lie sleeping.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.530
D-Daijodan?

07:37.530 --> 07:39.170
What a daring stance.

07:39.710 --> 07:40.780
What's "daijodan"?

07:41.080 --> 07:43.840
No stance lets you strike faster 
or land a hit easier.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.680
But it leaves your body wide open.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.320
So it's all about offense then?

07:52.050 --> 07:54.320
The young sensei has taken up a gedan stance!

07:54.800 --> 07:56.190
Another bold choice.

07:57.350 --> 07:59.680
A-And what's a "gedan" stance?

08:01.610 --> 08:07.400
Gedan keeps your arms low, so it's easier
to bide your time, but strikes come out slow.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.500
Put simply, it's a defensive stance.

08:10.900 --> 08:14.250
So Kondo-san will attack, 
and Yotaro-san will defend?

08:14.710 --> 08:17.490
Pretty much no one would use 
either stance in a real fight.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.420
What next?

08:46.590 --> 08:49.840
You baited a blow to the face 
to counter with one of your own?

08:51.640 --> 08:52.290
Magnificent.

08:53.310 --> 08:56.170
Point to Kyohachi. Contest over.

08:57.160 --> 08:57.870
He won!

08:58.120 --> 08:59.920
What a move.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.400
I've never seen a counter like that.

09:06.580 --> 09:09.090
Th-They moved so fast, 
I couldn't follow it.

09:09.530 --> 09:11.700
That guy really is strong.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.980
Kondo-san lost.

09:17.540 --> 09:18.160
Huh?

09:19.030 --> 09:21.460
I learned a lot from you today.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.610
Oh, no. Not as much as I learned from you.

09:24.020 --> 09:27.550
There's a big, wide world out there, 
full of swordsmen I've yet to meet.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.450
I am weak, and that's enough 
to make life worth living.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.390
Please teach me, all of you.

09:34.770 --> 09:36.470
Oh, no. We couldn't.

09:38.270 --> 09:41.240
I've never seen a guy so tough act so humble.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.480
No, I'm weak.

09:42.740 --> 09:45.580
Sensei! I never knew 
you were hiding your strength.

09:45.580 --> 09:47.970
No, I really haven't been.

09:48.540 --> 09:53.560
I worried what would become of this dojo 
when the old sensei up and vanished.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.970
Same. But it's in good hands.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.380
I'm sorry Nagi's running late.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.750
Maybe she went shopping.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.990
No, that's all right. We'll come again.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.490
Well then, if you'll excuse us...

10:22.980 --> 10:24.230
Thank you for everything.

10:28.550 --> 10:33.030
<i>What mighty blows. 
My hands are still trembling.</i>

10:36.740 --> 10:41.820
<i>Kondo Isami. Things would have gone 
differently if we'd fought with steel.</i>

10:42.920 --> 10:44.540
Nio-kun!

10:46.460 --> 10:47.290
Nagi-san!

10:47.290 --> 10:49.460
I'm so sorry. I was out.

10:49.460 --> 10:51.280
Oh, please don't run.

10:51.490 --> 10:52.750
I'll come to you.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.830
We were just leaving.

10:56.150 --> 10:58.800
Okay. I just got back.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.300
I'm really glad I got to see you.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.050
Yes, so am I.

11:05.310 --> 11:08.480
So you're with the Miburo, Nio-kun?

11:08.830 --> 11:10.330
Yes, we are.

11:10.740 --> 11:14.210
It's our job to keep Kyoto safe.

11:15.620 --> 11:18.940
We, the Blood Risshidan, 
have our target: the Miburo.

11:24.410 --> 11:25.950
What fine, upstanding work.

11:26.330 --> 11:26.960
Excuse me.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.240
Are you all right?

11:29.560 --> 11:30.280
Huh?

11:30.280 --> 11:33.720
Oh, I just wondered 
because you look a little pale.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.990
No, I'm fine.

11:37.420 --> 11:38.990
Nothing's the matter.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.150
What? Really?

11:41.360 --> 11:42.350
Really.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.410
Sorry. My mistake.

11:46.770 --> 11:47.530
It's no problem.

11:48.150 --> 11:51.230
Do you, um, mind if I come visit you again?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.750
Well, take care on your way home.

11:56.510 --> 11:58.260
Oh, right.

12:05.060 --> 12:06.040
Nagi-san!

12:09.320 --> 12:10.970
What's wrong? Did you forget something?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.240
Oh, no.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.990
You see, um, my granny's amazing.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.480
She makes amazing dango, 
she's good at business,

12:21.480 --> 12:24.250
she sews her own kimono, she's a great cook,

12:24.680 --> 12:27.700
and she makes a good midwife, too,
 if you can believe it.

12:30.310 --> 12:34.010
If you ever need help with anything, 
don't hesitate to ask.

12:37.420 --> 12:37.950
Bye.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.270
Nio, what's taking you so long?

12:42.270 --> 12:43.910
Ah, sorry.

13:09.390 --> 13:11.340
A samurai just jumped in!

13:11.340 --> 13:12.700
Into the freezing cold river?

13:12.700 --> 13:13.900
Is he nuts?

13:19.310 --> 13:20.020
Here.

13:21.570 --> 13:22.780
E-Excuse me...

13:22.780 --> 13:28.160
Ah, the water feels warmer 
than the air when it's this cold out.

13:30.230 --> 13:31.520
<i>Sorry, Nio-kun.</i>

13:32.760 --> 13:36.640
<i>All I can do now is keep this house safe.</i>

13:38.540 --> 13:41.640
<i>I believe in Yotaro-san.</i>

13:49.820 --> 13:51.880
I don't believe it.

13:52.940 --> 13:57.400
The authorities already know 
about the scuffle at Nijo Castle.

13:58.020 --> 14:01.310
They know Kyohachi students were behind it.

14:01.920 --> 14:05.950
As head of the dojo, 
don't you feel responsible?

14:11.850 --> 14:13.270
So we're all here at last.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.190
The Hound.

14:16.180 --> 14:17.320
The Agitator.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.050
The Lily.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.190
The Firework Maker.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.000
The Fiend.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.160
The Quiet.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.230
The Fool.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.260
And the Samurai.

14:31.340 --> 14:33.360
We strike in three days.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.980
On the night of the new moon, 
we, the Blood Risshidan,

14:37.200 --> 14:39.260
will take back the age of the samurai!

14:48.560 --> 14:51.660
What's the right word 
to stand for the Miburo?

14:52.690 --> 14:55.950
You're the only one still 
thinking about it so seriously.

14:56.390 --> 14:59.660
That's not true. 
I'm sure we're all using our heads.

15:00.260 --> 15:03.460
But it sure is hard to settle on something.

15:03.460 --> 15:09.470
<b>New</b>

15:03.950 --> 15:05.450
"New" might be nice.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.460
Oh, it's a new moon tonight. 
The stars should be gorgeous.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.460
Like I care.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.330
By the way, it's been three days 
since we visited Yotaro-san's dojo.

15:15.950 --> 15:17.560
How do you think Nagi-san's doing?

15:18.170 --> 15:19.520
I hope she's not in trouble.

15:19.810 --> 15:20.610
Nio.

15:23.350 --> 15:26.810
You might want to stop 
having that woman's back.

15:28.330 --> 15:29.080
Why?

15:29.750 --> 15:30.780
Lots of reasons.

15:31.010 --> 15:32.660
Like what? Tell me!

15:32.660 --> 15:34.120
Lots of reasons!

15:34.600 --> 15:36.810
It's a woman. A woman came to visit.

15:38.510 --> 15:39.800
Who is she?

15:40.150 --> 15:41.300
Is it Nagi-san?

15:41.650 --> 15:44.110
Beats me. I just heard it was a woman.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.420
What's that? Hijikata's brought a woman home?!

15:48.420 --> 15:51.710
Damn. When'd he get so smooth?

15:51.710 --> 15:54.030
H-How indecent. I won't stand for it.

15:54.030 --> 15:57.020
Is she a maiko? A geisha? 
A merchant's daughter?

16:00.680 --> 16:04.520
Wow. She knows her stuff.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.310
A sword grinder!

16:08.680 --> 16:10.400
Yes, about that...

16:10.790 --> 16:13.280
She may be a woman, but she knows her trade.

16:13.660 --> 16:17.120
Who do you think you are, 
bringing a woman home, Hijikata?!

16:17.120 --> 16:20.940
Th-That's right. We do men's 
work here. Have some decency.

16:20.940 --> 16:24.750
What a letdown! When I hear "woman,"
 I expect sex appeal!

16:27.160 --> 16:29.600
Wh-What a piercing glare.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.960
Yes, a childhood friend's look
 of unabashed fury.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.770
I... I know what you mean.
<i>Everyone's</i> been through that.

16:39.270 --> 16:43.070
Uh, while we're here, 
would you take a look at my sword, too?

16:43.070 --> 16:44.960
Well, better safe than sorry.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.670
Yes. I don't have a sword right now, 
but I'd like some advice.

16:48.670 --> 16:50.400
What are you lining up for?

16:50.830 --> 16:54.170
I'll inspect anyone's sword. 
Business is business.

16:54.970 --> 16:58.200
There aren't many woman 
swordsmiths, are there?

16:58.560 --> 16:59.790
That's amazing.

16:59.790 --> 17:02.480
Oh, no. There's nothing amazing about me.

17:02.740 --> 17:04.840
I'm Nio. It's a pleasure to meet you.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.200
I'm Sakura. The pleasure is mine.

17:08.540 --> 17:10.280
Hey, Nio! No fair!

17:10.280 --> 17:12.040
Get in line and wait your turn!

17:13.940 --> 17:15.840
When it comes to swords, I'm your woman.

17:16.310 --> 17:17.850
Sakura-chan!

17:21.320 --> 17:25.760
I'm astonished. It's as though 
you've breathed new life into it.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.720
My field work will go much smoother now.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.070
A hoe? Why?

17:32.720 --> 17:36.080
I see. It does stick in its sheath sometimes.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.020
Give my weapon a look.

17:38.540 --> 17:41.400
I was entrusted with 
this Kotetsu when I left Edo.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.330
A Kotetsu?

17:46.990 --> 17:51.170
No, this is no Kotetsu. It's a forgery.

17:55.260 --> 17:57.840
You can appraise swords, too?
 What a skill set.

17:58.390 --> 18:00.390
When it comes to swords, I'm your woman.

18:00.390 --> 18:03.230
What's this? A woman swordsmith?

18:03.530 --> 18:06.560
Did you forget to pay your 
respects to Serizawa-sensei?

18:13.010 --> 18:15.600
Th-That blade! H-How is it signed?

18:16.500 --> 18:21.370
Nagasone Okisato-nyudo Kotetsu. 
It was a gift from the lord of Mito.

18:22.610 --> 18:24.120
A Nabeshima Kotetsu!

18:24.320 --> 18:25.200
Amazing!

18:25.200 --> 18:28.880
I'm called Sakura. 
Please let me maintain this sword.

18:32.590 --> 18:33.880
I like you!

18:34.800 --> 18:39.510
Sakura, starting today, 
you're the Miburo's dedicated smith.

18:39.510 --> 18:41.310
Thank you, sir.

18:41.310 --> 18:43.380
Although I'll still charge you in full.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.840
Wh-What a businesswoman.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.640
She didn't waste any time 
winning over the top dog.

18:50.030 --> 18:52.080
Meet our new comrade!

18:52.080 --> 18:53.650
Way to go, Sakura-chan!

18:53.650 --> 18:55.030
Glad to have you!

18:58.240 --> 19:01.490
Look at them party. 
Do some work, why don'cha?

19:13.210 --> 19:13.720
<b>Challenge</b>

19:13.710 --> 19:15.710
Give this to them.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.420
<b>Challenge</b>

19:14.420 --> 19:14.840
<b>Challenge</b>

19:14.840 --> 19:15.710
<b>Challenge</b>

19:27.930 --> 19:30.350
W-W-W-W-We...

19:30.560 --> 19:32.110
We've got an emergency!

19:32.890 --> 19:33.680
What's wrong?

19:35.560 --> 19:39.980
Th-That Naozumi guy just showed up 
and said to give you this letter.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.470
Naozumi-san? Here?

19:41.950 --> 19:43.250
That man we met?

19:43.250 --> 19:44.160
Give it here.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.870
What's the fuss?

19:50.390 --> 19:52.620
Wh-What does it say?

19:52.970 --> 19:57.090
"Tonight, at the hour of the boar, we will 
collapse the seven bridges on the Kamo River,"

19:57.090 --> 20:00.520
"and set fire to Kyoto. 
Signed, the Blood Risshidan."

20:02.390 --> 20:03.230
Huh?

20:03.850 --> 20:07.350
Damn it. It's that dojo. 
They made the first move.

20:07.350 --> 20:11.150
Dojo? Nagi-san's place? What do you mean?

20:11.720 --> 20:15.240
That dojo, the Kyohachi School, is their base.

20:15.490 --> 20:16.200
What?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.350
The day you went there...

20:23.890 --> 20:29.240
Hajime spotted their lackeys 
among the students and consulted me.

20:29.940 --> 20:32.750
The two of us have spent 
the last three days investigating.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.460
We found out Naozumi and his gang
 have been visiting the place.

20:37.610 --> 20:39.680
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

20:41.200 --> 20:42.510
Don't blame Hajime.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.380
He was thinking of you, Nio.

20:50.350 --> 20:50.940
Let's go!

20:50.940 --> 20:52.320
Bring your swords!

20:52.320 --> 20:54.810
No lanterns. They'll give us away.

20:55.340 --> 20:59.320
Fire will spread swiftly in 
this wind. We must hurry!

20:59.320 --> 21:00.410
Right!

21:01.160 --> 21:01.790
Nio.

21:04.690 --> 21:05.620
This is yours.

21:06.160 --> 21:06.830
Yes, sir!

21:08.010 --> 21:10.180
Sakura, you stay here.

21:10.180 --> 21:11.170
I'm going with you.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.330
Hijikata!

21:14.920 --> 21:15.490
A map?

21:15.720 --> 21:17.460
You take command.

21:20.430 --> 21:23.960
We'll assign men to each bridge. 
Don't let anyone across!

21:24.240 --> 21:27.460
Nio! You hold the center!
 Can you handle it?

21:27.840 --> 21:28.580
Yes, sir!

21:31.360 --> 21:32.520
Now...

21:34.880 --> 21:36.180
Let's get started.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.180
Get moving! Run!

21:44.990 --> 21:49.990
<b>To Battle</b>

23:20.120 --> 23:25.500
<b>Next time</b>

23:20.690 --> 23:22.920
I'm Serizawa Kamo.

23:23.090 --> 23:24.800
The Blood Risshidan?

23:24.800 --> 23:29.830
Only a bunch of scoundrels 
would set out to torch Kyoto.

23:29.830 --> 23:32.890
I'll put them in their place.

23:33.170 --> 23:36.960
Come on, men. Run! Run!

23:36.960 --> 23:39.380
A hero's coming through!

23:39.380 --> 23:43.650
Let's finish this quick and
 go on a drinking spree.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.120
Next time: "A Place to Belong."

23:47.160 --> 23:49.990
<b>A
Place</b>

23:47.160 --> 23:49.990
<b>to 
Belong</b>
