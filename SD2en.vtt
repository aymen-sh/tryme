<b>Man, Mr. Sakamoto,
you were so cool the other day!</b>

01:58.030 --> 01:59.110
<b>VS. SON HEE AND BACHO</b>

01:59.200 --> 02:01.780
<b>That close-quarters combat was insane!</b>

02:01.870 --> 02:03.280
<b>Never seen anything like it!</b>

02:03.370 --> 02:06.870
<b>Even retired,
you're the absolute best for sure!</b>

02:06.960 --> 02:09.580
<b>Bam, bam, and then a counterpunch!</b>

02:09.670 --> 02:10.500
<b><i>Get back to work.</i></b>

02:10.580 --> 02:13.170
<b>And most of them
you killed with a single blow!</b>

02:13.250 --> 02:14.090
<b>What's that?</b>

02:14.800 --> 02:15.800
<b>"Killed"?</b>

02:16.590 --> 02:17.630
<b>Honey,</b>

02:23.850 --> 02:26.520
<b>But you killed all those guys,
just the other day.</b>

02:26.600 --> 02:28.060
<b>Made sure it wasn't fatal.</b>

02:28.140 --> 02:31.350
<b>Honey, do I need to remind you</b>

02:32.230 --> 02:35.190
<b>that I will file for divorce
if you break our family rule?</b>

02:35.280 --> 02:37.360
<b>Divorce!</b>

02:41.780 --> 02:43.490
<b>Good, I was just checking.</b>

02:43.990 --> 02:46.120
<b>I'm going to go sweep outside.</b>

02:49.250 --> 02:51.580
<b>So, what's this about a "family rule"?</b>

02:55.300 --> 02:58.380
<b>You have to stop killing me in your mind!</b>

02:58.460 --> 03:00.380

03:07.680 --> 03:09.180
<b>There's so much to see!</b>

03:09.980 --> 03:13.980
<b>But why'd we come all the way here

03:25.330 --> 03:27.700
<b><i>Got enough for Aoi and Hana, too.</i></b>

03:32.670 --> 03:36.420
<b><i>He loves his family so much!</i></b>

03:36.500 --> 03:40.340
<b>By the way, what was that "family rule"
Ms. Aoi was talking about?</b>

03:40.420 --> 03:41.300
<b><i>Drop it.</i></b>

03:41.380 --> 03:43.340
<b>No need to explain, just think about it!</b>

<b>Huh? A pork bun?</b>

08:43.270 --> 08:47.980
<b>Well, my dad taught me the basics,

08:48.060 --> 08:51.530
<b>Mr. Sakamoto, don't get involved in this!</b>

08:51.610 --> 08:53.740
<b>I have a bad feeling about her.</b>

09:24.270 --> 09:25.230
<b>Also,</b>

<b>the situation just got a lot worse.</b>

09:29.190 --> 09:33.230
<b>Bacho, I keep telling you,

09:33.320 --> 09:38.110
<b>Oh, shut up.
There's no "taste" in hits to begin with.</b>

09:38.200 --> 09:40.830
<b>We see, we kill.</b>

09:40.910 --> 09:43.870
<b>If you want,

09:43.950 --> 09:46.960
<b>I'm talking about the way you kill.</b>

09:47.460 --> 09:49.880
<b>It's like I'm talking to a baboon.</b>

09:49.960 --> 09:51.840
<b>What's with these guys?</b>

09:51.920 --> 09:54.090
<b>Son Hee and Bacho.</b>

09:54.170 --> 09:55.720

10:04.560 --> 10:07.850
<b><i>They make sketches of</i>
<i>their victims' heads as a hobby.</i></b>

10:07.940 --> 10:09.310
<b><i>They're insane!</i></b>

10:09.400 --> 10:12.150
<b>I guess we're famous now.</b>

10:12.230 --> 10:13.860
<b>Isn't that nice, Son Hee?</b>

10:13.940 --> 10:15.190
<b>You moron.</b>

10:15.280 --> 10:16.820
<b>We're hit men.</b>

10:16.900 --> 10:18.990
<b>We should be ashamed

10:19.070 --> 10:21.200
<b>Yeah, you should be ashamed!</b>

10:23.240 --> 10:26.290
<b>Are you mad 'cause we killed your friend?</b>

10:26.370 --> 10:28.660
<b>Looks like Lu's

10:28.750 --> 10:30.960
<b>You think you killed my friend?</b>

10:31.500 --> 10:33.130
<b>You must be pretty dumb.</b>

10:35.590 --> 10:39.180
<b>Only an amateur hit man

<b>Don't you think, Bacho?</b>

11:37.780 --> 11:39.780
<b>The roof must have been rotting.</b>

<b>Deal?</b>

11:50.040 --> 11:52.210
<b>This is all I have left of my parents…</b>

11:52.750 --> 11:55.210
<b>I'll guard it with my life!</b>

<b>Oh, my.</b>

11:57.290 --> 12:01.050
<b>Your parents said something like that

12:01.970 --> 12:03.380
<b>What a shame.</b>

12:03.470 --> 12:06.510
<b>Obsessing over some object

12:06.600 --> 12:08.890
<b>What terrible, terrible taste.</b>

12:08.970 --> 12:09.970
<b>Shut up!</b>

12:10.680 --> 12:11.680
<b>No!</b>

12:16.190 --> 12:17.360
<b>How dare you!</b>

12:17.440 --> 12:20.730
<b>Don't be dumb.
You can't let them get under your skin.</b>

12:28.200 --> 12:29.990
<b>Dad died protecting that.</b>

12:30.660 --> 12:32.200
<b>Killed by these assholes…</b>

12:32.290 --> 12:33.410
<b>Okay, then.</b>

12:36.630 --> 12:38.630
<b>Come on now, don't get in our way!</b>

12:39.210 --> 12:42.880
<b>She was so close to seeing her

12:42.970 --> 12:47.010
<b>No one has the right

12:50.100 --> 12:51.430
<b>Why…</b>

<b>Why are you risking your life to help me?</b>

<b>You're covered in blood again…</b>

<b>"Work"? I think you mean "murder"!</b>

<b>How can you do something like that?</b>

13:17.170 --> 13:19.670
<b>I had to work
so I could buy you a present…</b>

13:19.750 --> 13:23.090
<b>I don't want it. You're handing it to me

<b>That's it.</b>

13:29.510 --> 13:32.140
<b>If you can't change your ways,</b>

<b>What?</b>

15:57.280 --> 15:59.290
<b>Are you okay, Mr. Sakamoto?</b>

16:06.790 --> 16:09.380
<b><i>But Slashes of Hell is inescapable!</i></b>

16:09.460 --> 16:11.380
<b><i>Not to mention how big he is.</i></b>

16:11.470 --> 16:13.590
<b><i>How can it be?</i>
<i>There's not a single scratch on him!</i></b>

16:14.680 --> 16:17.300
<b>Bacho, you thinking what I'm thinking?</b>

16:17.390 --> 16:19.680
<b>I sure am, Brother. Let's do it!</b>

16:21.020 --> 16:23.890

<b><i>I'm not used to that kind of weight.</i></b>

16:51.550 --> 16:52.420
<b><i>Ouch.</i></b>

16:52.550 --> 16:54.590
<b>Here, Mr. Sakamoto, for your hand.</b>

17:22.370 --> 17:25.620
<b>Seriously, who are you two?</b>

17:30.420 --> 17:32.130
<b>Just a couple of retail workers.</b>

17:34.130 --> 17:37.260
<b>I don't get you one bit.</b>

17:37.340 --> 17:41.010
<b>Damn it! Where's Bacho and Son Hee?</b>

17:41.100 --> 17:43.930
<b>There's treasure right behind these doors!</b>

17:44.600 --> 17:48.100
<b>All I need is that key. That little key!</b>

17:48.190 --> 17:49.400
<b>Delivery!</b>

<b>Bacho! Son Hee!</b>

17:54.780 --> 17:56.570
<b>Who the hell are you?</b>

17:56.650 --> 17:58.490
<b>What did you do to my guards--</b>

17:58.570 --> 17:59.660
<b>Shut it.</b>

17:59.740 --> 18:00.910
<b>Don't say a word.</b>

18:00.990 --> 18:02.990
<b>You!</b>

18:04.540 --> 18:06.580
<b>Sorry! I'm sorry!</b>

18:06.660 --> 18:09.460
<b>I'll do anything! Please!</b>

18:09.540 --> 18:12.750
<b>"Sorry" won't bring back my parents!</b>

18:13.380 --> 18:15.210
<b>Get ready to repent in hell!</b>

18:24.390 --> 18:26.270
<b>Are you sure that's enough?</b>

18:26.350 --> 18:28.390
<b>Maybe a couple extra blows--</b>

18:31.400 --> 18:33.690
<b>Stop killing me in your mind!</b>

18:33.770 --> 18:35.650
<b><i>Stay out of it.</i></b>

18:38.320 --> 18:39.660
<b>It's enough.</b>

18:41.820 --> 18:45.160
<b>You can't go around killing people
every time they upset you.</b>

18:45.240 --> 18:47.870
<b>"Choose to live a happy life."</b>

<b>Can it, rude guy!</b>

18:59.930 --> 19:02.550
<b>I have a name and it's Lu Shaotang.</b>

19:03.180 --> 19:05.810
<b>This key is so old, it's not turning.</b>

19:08.980 --> 19:10.440
<b>Now we're talking!</b>

19:10.520 --> 19:11.650
<b>What's inside?</b>

19:11.730 --> 19:13.690
<b>Hey, I should go in first!</b>

19:15.400 --> 19:18.740
<b>Whoa! Look at all the treasure!</b>

19:19.900 --> 19:22.740
<b>And books? CDs? Plushies?</b>

19:23.450 --> 19:25.080
<b>What a weird collection…</b>

19:25.830 --> 19:28.160
<b>Look, an inventory.</b>

<b>Let's see.</b>

19:31.370 --> 19:37.000
<b>"The head of the Lu clan shall leave
their most treasured items in this vault."</b>

19:37.090 --> 19:40.380
<b>I guess each clan head
considers different things treasure.</b>

19:41.130 --> 19:42.760
<b>I wonder what my dad left.</b>

19:50.180 --> 19:51.310
<b>What does it say?</b>

19:52.270 --> 19:55.980
<b><i>"Something to drink with Shaotang</i>
<i>when she's of age."</i></b>

<b>Come on. What does it say?</b>

20:04.990 --> 20:08.290
<b>It says it's the best liquor on Earth!</b>

20:08.790 --> 20:10.790
<b>Have some! A sign of my gratitude.</b>

20:12.620 --> 20:14.830
<b>It better be good stuff!</b>

20:17.500 --> 20:20.670
<b>Mr. Sakamoto, you held on to these?</b>

20:20.760 --> 20:23.590
<b>What are these? Why are they all smashed?</b>

20:23.680 --> 20:25.550
<b>Because of you.</b>

20:26.180 --> 20:28.010
<b><i>They still taste good, though.</i></b>
