00:00.710 --> 00:05.000
I'm known as the Hound, 
and I hunt the beasts called samurai.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.230
Now, draw your weapons!

00:07.750 --> 00:13.000
Would you take the head of 
Nagakura Shinpachi and leave it at that?

00:13.230 --> 00:14.990
You've got rotten luck, old man.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.740
You cocky brat!

00:18.580 --> 00:20.370
I'm not a softy like Shinpachi.

00:21.330 --> 00:23.200
I don't care what your deal is.

00:23.360 --> 00:25.250
When it comes to killing, I won't hold back.

00:27.980 --> 00:29.260
Just kidding.

00:29.650 --> 00:34.300
I'm not bad with a sword, 
but this comes so much more natural.

00:34.680 --> 00:38.580
We're outcasts, but the Miburo 
make us feel like we belong.

00:39.530 --> 00:43.860
You should've come to us instead, old man.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.040
I knew you were showing your age.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.660
Useless trash.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.050
Hang in there, old-timer!

01:11.720 --> 01:15.240
Damn you, Fiend.

01:19.360 --> 01:22.980

That house with the gate!

03:01.290 --> 03:01.870
Good.

03:02.670 --> 03:03.950
The gate's open.

03:04.470 --> 03:07.920
Y-You want me to run 
all the way to Kurotani, right?

03:08.260 --> 03:11.160
Yup. Ask Aizu for reinforcements.

03:11.340 --> 03:15.240
As if they'll believe anything I say.

03:15.410 --> 03:17.860
Please, Taro-kun. It's all up to you.

03:17.860 --> 03:18.840
Shut up!

03:19.270 --> 03:21.540
To hell with it! I'll do what I can!

I hit them all with the back of my blade.

03:55.130 --> 03:56.470
Nice work.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.220
Then allow me to handle their boss.

04:02.790 --> 04:03.320
Wait.

04:05.310 --> 04:06.710
That's odd.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.830
There are eight ringleaders 
and seven bridges.

04:09.830 --> 04:11.690
One of them <i>has</i> to be here.

Are you okay, old man?

04:27.050 --> 04:28.680
Hey, old man!

04:28.960 --> 04:29.970
Sanosuke.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.960
I told you to stand aside.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.490
Huh?

04:44.930 --> 04:45.990
A short sword?

04:46.450 --> 04:50.290
<i>No, that's ridiculous. 
I should've been well out of reach.</i>

04:51.020 --> 04:53.190
<i>Even if it were a long sword, 
I should've be out of range.</i>

04:54.760 --> 04:56.360
Ah, this won't do.

04:58.930 --> 05:02.910
You face Nagakura Shinpachi 
of the Mibu Roshigumi.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.820
Huh.

05:07.250 --> 05:09.830
Do you think we're fighting 
a duel or something?

05:21.580 --> 05:22.420
<i>He's fast.</i>

05:22.650 --> 05:25.400
<i>And he hits hard.</i>

05:26.760 --> 05:27.470
<i>Not good.</i>

05:29.000 --> 05:30.710
<i>I need to keep him at a distance.</i>

05:32.480 --> 05:37.160
<i>I had no doubts about living 
as a samurai. As a warrior.</i>

05:38.680 --> 05:43.730
<i>Born to Nagakura Kanji, 
who served Matsumae Domain in Edo,</i>

05:44.140 --> 05:46.720
<i>I grew up in Edo without a care in the world.</i>

05:47.610 --> 05:50.280
Why, if it isn't young Lord Nagakura.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.790
What a handsome face he has.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.340
You can count on him
 to cut a dashing figure.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.050
He's always earnest and polite, I hear.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.290
A model samurai.

06:01.770 --> 06:06.710
<i>I wasn't a terribly diligent student, 
except when it came to swordsmanship.</i>

06:07.660 --> 06:12.760
<i>I became a master of the 
Shindo Munen School by the age of 18.</i>

06:13.760 --> 06:19.320
<i>Then I went from one dojo to another, 
seeking strength and nothing more.</i>

06:20.480 --> 06:25.830
<i>Up until I met Kondo at the Shieikan 
and my life took a detour.</i>

06:28.700 --> 06:30.700
<i>You could say I was a classic swordsman.</i>

06:32.740 --> 06:37.330
<i>Free of doubt or hesitation, I simply...</i>

06:38.760 --> 06:41.190
<i>kept walking the path of the sword.</i>

06:50.840 --> 06:52.670
Utterly underhanded.

06:53.860 --> 06:56.980
Underhanded? I don't follow.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.890
What need did you have to kill the old man?

07:00.890 --> 07:05.230
Much less to stab him from behind 
and without warning.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.870
He's weak, so he'll die. The strong survive.

07:09.140 --> 07:11.240
That's samurai logic.

07:13.070 --> 07:13.960
I see.

07:14.750 --> 07:18.660
In that case, you'll die here. 
That's as it should be.

07:19.820 --> 07:21.600
No!

07:22.520 --> 07:24.420
Old man! You still with us?

07:24.560 --> 07:26.970
H-His technique is—

07:26.970 --> 07:28.540
Hey! Don't force yourself to talk!

07:28.910 --> 07:34.440
His technique is an iai strike
like a fiend's scythe.

07:34.810 --> 07:37.540
Don't give him the room to use it.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.440
It's time you died.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.380
Shinpachi!

07:48.880 --> 07:51.200
I got this sword off 
one of the grunts! Use it!

08:09.880 --> 08:14.160
A sword reflects its wielder's true nature.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.850
Carefree.

08:17.340 --> 08:18.740
And supple.

08:21.160 --> 08:26.180
Serene and free like a bird in flight.

08:27.860 --> 08:29.110
Almost like a...

08:39.140 --> 08:40.250
A flying swallow.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.600
I see. What a shame.

08:54.830 --> 08:56.640
You win.

09:02.580 --> 09:08.840
I never knew there were 
such samurai. Such warriors.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.280
The old man's dead.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.190
He said you were one hell of a samurai.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.670
Let's give him a funeral later, Sanosuke.

09:35.550 --> 09:39.560
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

09:35.550 --> 09:39.560
<b>Shijo Bridge</b>

09:40.030 --> 09:43.050
Welcome. This is the bridge of fate.

09:44.050 --> 09:44.850
Excuse me?

09:47.090 --> 09:48.800
The bridge of fate?

09:48.800 --> 09:52.070
Yes. The bridge that will decide your fate.

09:52.560 --> 09:57.060
Will you join me? Or will you 
end your lives in obscurity?

09:57.450 --> 09:58.540
Don't waste your breath.

10:00.370 --> 10:01.030
Go.

10:01.030 --> 10:01.490
Huh?

10:02.600 --> 10:03.500
Go get him.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.590
H-How's he so strong?

10:26.540 --> 10:28.120
<i>Hijikata Toshizo.</i>

10:28.760 --> 10:32.980
<i>I never noticed because 
I'm always with Serizawa-sensei.</i>

10:34.710 --> 10:36.400
Out of my way, small fry.

10:36.890 --> 10:38.960
Never touch a sword again.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.650
<i>H-He's good. And ruthless.</i>

10:47.130 --> 10:48.410
Magnificent.

10:50.070 --> 10:54.420
But a sword's not a hatchet. 
You shouldn't swing it so wildly.

10:54.690 --> 10:55.320
Huh?

10:56.010 --> 10:59.640
You'll chip or bend the blade 
and ruin it in no time.

11:02.820 --> 11:04.900
Recognize this? It's a Kanenaga.

11:05.510 --> 11:10.500
The shine, the brightness, the deep hamon...
 You can't help but admire it.

11:11.590 --> 11:14.950
It's a masterpiece, 
forged late in the Kamakura period.

11:15.830 --> 11:17.430
What's your sword?

11:17.920 --> 11:21.120
It looks unremarkable, 
but what is it called?

11:23.670 --> 11:25.880
A woman no one's heard of made it.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.040
As for a name...

11:28.280 --> 11:31.200
I guess I'll call it "No-Name."

11:34.550 --> 11:35.880
Let's change the subject.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.700
Would you tell me about your connections?

11:38.940 --> 11:40.790
My what?

11:40.790 --> 11:41.890
Who you know.

11:42.250 --> 11:45.200
How many notables you have ties to.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.720
Connections are the 
true measure of a man's worth.

11:49.220 --> 11:51.360
You must know of Dairaku Gentaro.

11:52.060 --> 11:57.980
I've drunk with him. 
You might call us sworn brothers.

11:58.490 --> 11:59.410
Never heard of him.

12:00.240 --> 12:05.240
Never heard of him?! You've <i>never</i> heard 
of Dairaku Gentaro of Choshu?!

12:05.660 --> 12:07.760
He's a great patriot. A man of renown.

12:08.020 --> 12:12.470
He ushered in this age of assassination 
in the name of divine punishment.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.750
News to me. Who is he?

12:16.200 --> 12:18.880
Well, these things do happen.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.010
Let's try a different connection.

12:21.840 --> 12:26.010
Speaking of Choshu, does the name 
Katsura Kogoro ring any bells?

12:26.010 --> 12:27.040
Katsura?

12:27.200 --> 12:29.880
I've debated with him.

12:30.490 --> 12:32.090
Or take Kusaka-dono.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.660
I've shared a bath with him.

12:35.970 --> 12:39.840
In Tosa, I passed <i>the</i> 
Takechi Zuizan on the street.

12:40.940 --> 12:44.790
I've even seen the great Saigo of Satsuma.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.790
Never heard of them!

12:49.170 --> 12:50.480
What?!

12:50.770 --> 12:52.790
Wh-What ignorance.

12:52.790 --> 12:56.920
E-Everyone knows Katsura Kogoro, 
even at the Renpeikan dojo in Edo.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.800
I don't, and I don't care to.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.290
It itches.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.560
This thing itches like hell.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.730
The longer you talk, the itchier it gets.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.620
I've had enough. Now die.

13:17.070 --> 13:19.600
Don't you care about 
making your mark on history?

13:19.890 --> 13:22.070
I can't fathom that attitude.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.100
Shut up already.

13:24.860 --> 13:29.490
If our uprising succeeds—
no, if it even makes a stir,

13:29.750 --> 13:31.820
the Risshidan's fame will skyrocket.

13:32.500 --> 13:37.330
And it won't end there. Once lit, 
the anti-shogunate flames will refuse to die.

13:37.610 --> 13:43.250
I'll incite Tosa, Satsuma, and Choshu 
and change the course of history.

13:43.460 --> 13:45.610
Yes, me! The man called—

13:47.680 --> 13:48.840
Oh, excuse me.

13:49.090 --> 13:51.090
I got sick of your bullshit.

13:54.210 --> 13:57.280
What's this? Don't you even have a name?

14:01.080 --> 14:03.450
You're all talk. Now, die.

14:12.860 --> 14:13.720
That'll cost you.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.530
You thought I was all talk?

14:17.090 --> 14:19.690
It takes substance to gather a following.

14:20.450 --> 14:25.580
Shindo Munen-ryu, Hokushin Itto-ryu, 
Kyoshin Meichi-ryu...

14:26.010 --> 14:28.350
I've studied almost every school
 you've ever heard of.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.600
<i>O-Oh, no. This guy's good.</i>

14:34.940 --> 14:39.120
So why? If you're so capable, 
why obsess over reputation?

14:40.190 --> 14:42.100
What drives you?

14:43.160 --> 14:45.540
Nothing. Nothing at all.

14:46.440 --> 14:51.230
Only shallow men like you assume
 every action has a motive.

14:52.880 --> 14:53.810
Is that so?

14:54.140 --> 14:55.880
A word of warning.

14:56.640 --> 15:01.440
The way you stand and where you look 
make your strikes too obvious,

15:01.440 --> 15:03.880
even if they do stray a little to the right.

15:08.990 --> 15:13.130
When was it? There were 
these rare swallowtail butterflies.

15:13.780 --> 15:19.140
I'd cross a hill or two chasing them, 
and my sister always let me have them.

15:19.810 --> 15:21.980
I picked up a weird nickname from that.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.260
"Demon Feet."

15:29.030 --> 15:29.780
<i>He's fast!</i>

15:30.330 --> 15:33.840
If you think dojos are all there 
is to sword fighting, think again.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.430
Got him!

15:41.400 --> 15:42.680
That won't work on me.

15:43.730 --> 15:44.320
Huh?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.920
Ch-Chain mail?!

16:00.650 --> 16:01.730
Damn it!

16:01.730 --> 16:05.310
Toshi, your swordsmanship 
is too predictable.

16:07.010 --> 16:09.070
Oh, I give up!

16:12.440 --> 16:16.060
I've got no talent. I can tell 
that much by watching you guys.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.820
<i>I can't change that easily.</i>

16:21.120 --> 16:25.880
<i>Going back to peddling medicine 
and scrapping every now and then</i>

16:25.880 --> 16:27.590
<i>will be the best thing for me.</i>

16:28.340 --> 16:29.510
You have it wrong, Toshi.

16:30.910 --> 16:33.090
Grip it more like this.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.090
Cup it gently in your hands.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.850
You sulk over everything.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.360
You think it'll get you more attention.

16:40.770 --> 16:42.850
Hey! Shut your trap, Soji!

16:43.030 --> 16:45.240
That's the spirit I want to see.

16:45.590 --> 16:46.600
Shut up.

16:46.800 --> 16:47.750
You win.

16:48.300 --> 16:52.770
But gimme something to go on. 
What do I have to do to get stronger?

16:52.770 --> 16:56.660
Always looking for help. You think 
people will tell you just because you ask.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.840
Toshi, you're already strong.

17:02.260 --> 17:04.720
You've never lost a 
man-to-man fight, have you?

17:04.940 --> 17:06.500
Well, no.

17:07.140 --> 17:09.880
You're not here to inherit 
the Tennen Rishin School.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.760
Just study it as one more way to fight.

17:14.230 --> 17:18.370
You do things your own way. 
What's wrong with the Hijikata School?

17:20.890 --> 17:23.520
So a no-name school then.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.770
This looks bad, Hijikata-san!

17:26.260 --> 17:28.290
We need to fall back and regroup before—

17:29.100 --> 17:32.280
It's too late for that. Sleep in obscurity.

17:35.850 --> 17:37.520
I told you, that won't work on me.

17:39.440 --> 17:43.290
Toshi, your first stroke 
is especially easy to read.

17:45.530 --> 17:48.410
You're practically asking 
your opponent to counter it.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.880
I told you, I can read you like a book.

17:52.590 --> 17:54.360
So what should I do about it?

17:54.620 --> 17:56.420
Oh, that's simple.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.740
Strike again before they do.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.800
What?

18:02.530 --> 18:03.560
And after that?

18:03.790 --> 18:05.800
A third blow, then a fourth.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.670
Just keep battering them.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.600
That's how a wild fellow 
like you ought to fight.

18:17.410 --> 18:19.210
That's your Hijikata School.

18:26.680 --> 18:27.670
What the...

18:28.720 --> 18:31.880
Have you no plan? All you do is flail!

18:32.150 --> 18:33.200
<i>Kondo-san...</i>

18:36.640 --> 18:39.210
Was that a kick just now? 
How'd you manage that?

18:39.670 --> 18:45.930
<i>Bottomless greed, dedication, and humility.
 In the old days, he'd have been a daimyo.</i>

18:46.200 --> 18:49.600
<i>Even now, he might go down in history.</i>

18:52.720 --> 18:54.350
What a sorry sight.

18:54.950 --> 18:56.440
Did you get beat again?

18:56.680 --> 19:00.230
<i>Soji just blossomed one day out of the blue.</i>

19:01.080 --> 19:02.750
<i>Hell, he's a prodigy.</i>

19:02.960 --> 19:07.120
By the way, I came up 
with a new move. Wanna see?

19:07.640 --> 19:13.610
<i>He might found his own school, 
or maybe start something even bigger.</i>

19:14.430 --> 19:16.630
<i>I don't let on, but I can't wait to see.</i>

19:17.380 --> 19:18.600
<i>So what about me?</i>

19:21.670 --> 19:23.140
<i>What ferocity.</i>

19:24.990 --> 19:27.780
<i>How long is he going to keep this up?</i>

19:30.680 --> 19:34.080
<i>It's light, fits my hand, 
and can take a beating.</i>

19:35.420 --> 19:37.460
<i>Chip it? Bend it?</i>

19:38.380 --> 19:39.530
<i>Who cares?</i>

19:41.270 --> 19:42.220
<i>Sakura...</i>

19:44.010 --> 19:46.740
<i>You're a damn genius.</i>

19:56.600 --> 20:01.930
I don't know why, but I'm surrounded
 by folks who make my jaw drop.

20:01.930 --> 20:05.120
W-Wait! Let's talk! Yes, talk!

20:05.460 --> 20:06.920
First, tell me your name and...

20:07.750 --> 20:09.840
<i>All of you can go down in history.</i>

20:10.720 --> 20:11.640
<i>Not me.</i>

20:13.090 --> 20:14.850
<i>I'm a man of the soil.</i>

20:16.360 --> 20:18.930
<i>I'm happy being a grain of wheat,</i>

20:20.240 --> 20:24.700
<i>helping someone else grow
 on the land. In this dirt.</i>

20:28.840 --> 20:30.080
My name is...

20:30.460 --> 20:31.820
My name is...

20:35.880 --> 20:36.580
Bide...

20:44.740 --> 20:48.120
Bidebu... zaburo...

20:48.560 --> 20:49.970
A name?

20:50.700 --> 20:53.200
What's that worth?

20:53.950 --> 20:58.320
As for me, I threw my lot in 
with the guys who saved me.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.980
Forget anyone else. That's all I need.

21:03.450 --> 21:07.740
Unbelievable.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.530
I got chills.

21:10.790 --> 21:11.300
Huh?

21:12.400 --> 21:13.740
I want to be like you.

21:14.290 --> 21:16.760
Noguchi! What're you crying for?

21:16.760 --> 21:19.100
Hijikata Toshizo!

21:19.100 --> 21:20.760
Keep it down.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.410
Now, hurry it up. 
We've got more to send packing.

21:24.760 --> 21:28.770
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

21:24.760 --> 21:28.770
<b>Matsubara Bridge</b>

21:36.880 --> 21:38.610
That wasn't even a warm-up.

21:42.970 --> 21:43.960
So it's you.

21:45.030 --> 21:50.040
<b>Man
of</b>

21:45.030 --> 21:50.040
<b>the
Soil</b>

23:20.170 --> 23:25.550
<b>Next time</b>

23:21.520 --> 23:22.800
This is Saito Hajime.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.170
So I'm fighting that Ayame guy, huh?

23:27.090 --> 23:31.810
Something about him gives me the creeps,
but I must keep the city safe, no matter what.

23:33.380 --> 23:35.500
No, that's not right.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.700
I don't want to let anyone beat me.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.440
I just want to keep getting stronger.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.000
I promised I would.

23:45.340 --> 23:46.900
Next time: "Successor."

23:47.200 --> 23:50.040
<b>Successor</b>

23:47.680 --> 23:48.850
Don't you dare miss it.
