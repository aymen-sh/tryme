WEBVTT

00:02:27.843 --> 00:02:30.280
- Looking good.
- Don't lie to me.

00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:32.152
I'm not, you all right?

00:02:32.326 --> 00:02:33.501
Hell no.

00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:35.328
Hear anything?

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.332
Could we not?

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:40.638
I just miss you.

00:02:41.552 --> 00:02:42.552
We all do.

00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:44.120
Just cut the bullshit

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:45.948
and tell me what I want to hear.

00:02:46.122 --> 00:02:47.906
Do I have a court date yet?

00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:51.736
- I'm working on it.
- Shit.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.565
This fucking lawyer's
taking too goddamn long.

00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:57.873
What about that other thing?

00:02:58.047 --> 00:02:59.135
I took out the garbage.

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:01.616
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's done.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.139
It's about time.

00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:06.708
Oh, and we're still planning
that big dinner.

00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:09.363
- How big?
- Big.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:11.645
In fact,
we're gonna need to go out

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:12.757
and get some more meat.

00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:14.281
- Yeah?
- Yes, and this is growing

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:15.735
a little bigger than we thought.

00:03:18.023 --> 00:03:19.023
That a problem?

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:20.678
Not for me.

00:03:21.984 --> 00:03:23.942
More just means more.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:26.771
Now, you sure you going
to have everything ready

00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:27.945
when the guests arrive?

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:29.426
I'm sure.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.993
These guests don't like waiting.

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:32.864
I got this, Pop.

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:34.170
- Do you?
- I do.

00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:39.654
You're sure you can handle this?

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.223
Yeah.

00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:47.183
All right then.

00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:50.881
All right.

00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:26.403
Claire, you want
to give that a try?

00:04:39.148 --> 00:04:40.541
What took you so long, my man?

00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:44.240
Oh.

00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:46.503
Clinton's Colonel Lee Gunner
is back from Afghanistan

00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:48.157
after a long year away.

00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:50.159
Here, the President awarded Lee

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:52.292
the Medal of Honor
for his bravery,

00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:54.381
above and beyond
the call of duty.

00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:57.297
Hey, are you that guy
on the television?

00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:58.471
Welcome home, Lee.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.626
Hold on... I can handle them.

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:26.804
We don't need trouble.

00:05:27.892 --> 00:05:29.546
This town's changed a lot.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.880
You've been gone a long time.

00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:35.857
Come on now, fellas,

00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:37.380
you'll scare away my patrons.

00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:39.295
I'm in need
of the coldest beer you got.

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:40.775
First round's on the house.

00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:04.799
Where's Dave, huh?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.892
Not here, man.

00:06:12.284 --> 00:06:13.284
When's he coming in?

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:14.417
He's not.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.375
He owes me money.

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.073
Really? For what?

00:06:21.337 --> 00:06:22.469
Who the hell are you?

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:25.994
Nobody.

00:06:26.168 --> 00:06:28.953
I think I'll just wait around
until Dave gets here.

00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:30.215
He won't be here.

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:33.828
Why the hell not?

00:06:35.743 --> 00:06:36.743
'Cause he's dead.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.050
Is he now?

00:06:42.314 --> 00:06:43.446
What happened to him?

00:06:52.194 --> 00:06:54.022
Why you eyeballing me?

00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:55.458
'Cause I don't like you.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.590
Get out.

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:00.855
I'm not done with my beer.

00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:08.340
Oops.

00:07:09.298 --> 00:07:10.865
Yes, you are.

00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:06.311
Very impressive, man.

00:08:07.182 --> 00:08:08.749
I got your edge.

00:08:08.923 --> 00:08:11.316
I mean, that's some
Special Forces kung fu shit.

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:16.428
I'll catch you later, man,
let's go.

00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:17.452
Come on, let's go.

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:29.509
So much for helping out
with the family business.

00:08:31.554 --> 00:08:32.947
Can I still come by later?

00:08:33.121 --> 00:08:34.992
I need to see the boys.

00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:38.953
Look, Lee, I understand what
you're trying to do, but...

00:08:39.127 --> 00:08:40.650
Obviously we have
to close early.

00:08:43.392 --> 00:08:44.611
I'll come by at 7:00, okay?

00:08:55.404 --> 00:08:56.404
Lee.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.062
Can we talk to you for a minute?

00:09:01.236 --> 00:09:02.454
The way I hear it,

00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:04.718
you messed up
those bikers really bad.

00:09:04.892 --> 00:09:06.532
They gonna be looking
to settle the score.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:08.983
Come on, Bob.

00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:11.420
We don't need no more trouble
in this town...

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:14.075
you understand?

00:09:14.249 --> 00:09:15.685
Hey, he asked you a question.

00:09:15.859 --> 00:09:17.948
Goddammit, Wally,
did I ask for your input?

00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:21.082
- No, sir.
- Sorry, Lee.

00:09:21.256 --> 00:09:23.258
You understand
what I'm asking of you,

00:09:23.432 --> 00:09:25.347
as a friend?

00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:27.871
Yeah, yeah I understand, Bob.

00:09:28.045 --> 00:09:30.265
Okay. Goodnight.

00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:32.483
Good to see you, Bob.

00:09:35.357 --> 00:09:36.053
Let's go, come on.

00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:37.227
That's it?

00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:38.708
Yeah, let's go.

00:09:49.284 --> 00:09:51.242
So, I was thinking...

00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:57.292
I'd like to take you guys
camping tomorrow.

00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:02.166
What?

00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:04.560
You don't like camping?

00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:08.390
Yeah, when I was, like, six.

00:10:15.353 --> 00:10:18.705
Why can't you just act
like any normal absent father

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:22.752
and give us a PS5, or cash?

00:10:23.753 --> 00:10:25.407
Something we might enjoy.

00:10:26.408 --> 00:10:27.408
Isn't that right, bud?

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:34.155
Well, I for one actually do
want to go camping.

00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:36.548
You couldn't have
mentioned this to me first?

00:10:38.463 --> 00:10:40.465
Just a thought I had.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.729
May I be excused?
Why?

00:10:42.903 --> 00:10:43.904
I'm going to Hailey's.

00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:45.078
Are her parents home?

00:10:45.209 --> 00:10:46.689
Yes, and they know I'm coming.

00:10:54.392 --> 00:10:55.655
Who's Hailey?

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:57.439
His girlfriend.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.662
He has a girlfriend?

00:11:02.836 --> 00:11:05.099
Yeah, he's 16.

00:11:05.273 --> 00:11:07.362
Can we really
go camping tomorrow?

00:11:10.408 --> 00:11:13.281
I called your Uncle Jon,
he said he'd come with us.

00:11:15.762 --> 00:11:16.882
What you got there, partner?

00:11:18.765 --> 00:11:20.114
Your Medal of Honor.

00:11:20.288 --> 00:11:22.116
You said I could
keep it safe for you

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.596
while you were gone.

00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:26.642
Looks like you're taking
real good care of it.

00:11:26.816 --> 00:11:28.165
What'd you do to get it?

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.559
Just did my job.

00:11:31.647 --> 00:11:33.431
That's all anyone can do.

00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:35.259
Well, what's my job?

00:11:36.521 --> 00:11:37.827
Start with your homework.

00:11:38.001 --> 00:11:39.568
That would be nice.

00:11:39.742 --> 00:11:40.787
Okay.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:43.746
Since you're back.

00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:02.199
I feel like a stranger.

00:12:03.635 --> 00:12:04.635
That's what you are.

00:12:07.204 --> 00:12:08.902
Fair enough.

00:12:09.076 --> 00:12:11.208
I'm still their father though.

00:12:11.382 --> 00:12:12.732
They don't know you,

00:12:12.906 --> 00:12:15.256
'cause you were never here.

00:12:16.561 --> 00:12:18.694
I tried, I tried.

00:12:18.868 --> 00:12:20.261
I did my best.

00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:22.480
I told you if you reenlisted
one more time,

00:12:22.654 --> 00:12:23.960
I'd divorce you.

00:12:24.134 --> 00:12:25.396
It's who I am.

00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:28.530
You knew that
from the beginning.

00:12:28.704 --> 00:12:30.880
We heard nothing from you
for a year.

00:12:31.054 --> 00:12:33.317
We thought you were dead.

00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:35.232
I'm making up lies for the boys.

00:12:36.451 --> 00:12:38.105
Who does that to their family?

00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:44.328
What about what I said,
about taking them camping?

00:12:44.502 --> 00:12:45.895
Yeah, right.

00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:48.071
I'm serious,
I have all the gear.

00:12:50.204 --> 00:12:51.466
Let me take 'em.

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.817
I know you been through a lot.

00:12:54.991 --> 00:12:59.213
And there's nothing
I can say except I'm sorry.

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:04.348
So let me take the boys
for a few days.

00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:07.482
Get to know each other.

00:13:11.573 --> 00:13:13.488
I can see you trying, Lee.

00:13:13.662 --> 00:13:16.143
If you hadn't come and
straightened out things at the bar,

00:13:16.317 --> 00:13:19.320
I wouldn't be able
to pay next month's rent.

00:13:19.494 --> 00:13:21.670
I'm telling you,
there's so much more

00:13:21.844 --> 00:13:23.454
that I can do
for you and the boys.

00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:29.504
We lost a child.

00:13:29.678 --> 00:13:31.438
Do you really think
you can make up for that?

00:13:31.506 --> 00:13:32.637
No.

00:13:34.683 --> 00:13:35.963
No, that's not
what I'm thinking.

00:13:36.032 --> 00:13:37.294
What were you thinking?

00:13:42.212 --> 00:13:44.606
I was thinking I'd just like
to take the boys camping.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:16.986
Morning, Jon.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.728
Jesus, Lee,
it's the crack of dawn.

00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:23.732
Any bites?

00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:25.188
Buddy, I've known you
too many years

00:14:25.212 --> 00:14:26.778
to make up a fish story now.

00:14:26.953 --> 00:14:28.824
You see any fish?

00:14:28.998 --> 00:14:30.434
Better get a move on,

00:14:30.608 --> 00:14:32.436
we hit that ridgeline
before dark.

00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:35.396
Let me get my shit.

00:14:38.094 --> 00:14:39.443
Drop off those toys?

00:14:40.923 --> 00:14:41.923
Yes, sir.

00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:45.362
I dropped off the four-wheelers

00:14:45.536 --> 00:14:46.320
at the meeting spot,

00:14:46.494 --> 00:14:47.669
all packed and ready.

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:50.063
But, hey, Lee,

00:14:50.237 --> 00:14:52.108
looks like that private
security firm of yours

00:14:52.282 --> 00:14:53.980
is paying you
some pretty big bucks.

00:14:55.024 --> 00:14:56.591
Maybe you get me a job?

00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:58.941
Ha! Maybe.

00:15:35.108 --> 00:15:37.632
- Dad!
- Hey.

00:15:37.806 --> 00:15:39.808
Travis didn't
come home last night.

00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:44.291
He's probably
still at his girlfriend's.

00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:45.640
It's down the street.

00:15:48.773 --> 00:15:51.428
Listen, why don't you go
with your Uncle Jon?

00:15:51.602 --> 00:15:53.300
You want to start up the trail?

00:15:53.474 --> 00:15:55.911
I'll grab Travis and meet you
at the fork in the river.

00:15:56.085 --> 00:15:57.521
It's four hours to the fork,

00:15:57.695 --> 00:15:58.815
how are you gonna get there?

00:16:04.354 --> 00:16:06.095
Never mind. Come on, Luke.

00:16:07.357 --> 00:16:08.402
Bye, Mom.

00:16:09.185 --> 00:16:10.185
Yeah.

00:16:29.727 --> 00:16:30.728
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:32.817 --> 00:16:35.385
Hey, I need Travis.

00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:37.344
Yeah, I'm Hailey's father.

00:16:37.518 --> 00:16:38.998
That's great.

00:16:39.172 --> 00:16:40.477
I still need Travis.

00:16:40.651 --> 00:16:42.523
- Right now?
- Yeah, can you go get him?

00:16:42.697 --> 00:16:43.828
No, he's asleep.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.265
Well, wake him up.

00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:47.484
I'm not intruding
on their privacy.

00:16:47.658 --> 00:16:49.312
- Their privacy?
- Right.

00:16:52.707 --> 00:16:54.274
You can't come
barging into my house

00:16:54.448 --> 00:16:55.840
without an invitation!

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.365
Travis?

00:17:06.677 --> 00:17:07.677
Get up!

00:17:15.121 --> 00:17:17.210
I'm not going, I'm sick.

00:17:17.384 --> 00:17:18.385
You're going.

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:19.603
Get out of bed, come on.

00:17:20.343 --> 00:17:21.779
Mom? Dad?

00:17:22.737 --> 00:17:24.434
Let's go. Really?

00:17:24.608 --> 00:17:26.654
My wife's already called
the sheriff's department.

00:17:26.828 --> 00:17:28.264
Good, you can explain to them

00:17:28.438 --> 00:17:30.701
why you let underage kids
drink, take drugs,

00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:32.007
and sleep together.

00:17:34.357 --> 00:17:36.359
Drugs?

00:17:36.533 --> 00:17:39.362
We said they could have
just a few beers, that's all.

00:17:39.536 --> 00:17:41.060
Hailey?

00:17:41.234 --> 00:17:43.453
Call the cops back
and tell them it was a mistake.

00:17:43.627 --> 00:17:44.846
What kind of parents let a boy

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.302
spend the night
with their daughter?

00:17:46.326 --> 00:17:47.675
It's called a sleepover.

00:17:47.849 --> 00:17:48.893
A sleepover?

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.373
Okay, that's what you call it.

00:17:50.547 --> 00:17:51.872
You know what,
it's that kind of attitude

00:17:51.896 --> 00:17:52.984
is why your Travis is here

00:17:53.159 --> 00:17:54.595
and doesn't want to go with you.

00:17:54.769 --> 00:17:56.569
Yeah, I'm sure he'd rather
stay here all night

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.207
and have sex with your daughter.

00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:00.079
Your Uncle Jon's
gonna meet us at the fork.

00:18:00.253 --> 00:18:01.689
So, how are we gonna get there?

00:18:10.001 --> 00:18:11.001
Wait, you're serious?

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.787
No, no, I'm not jumping.

00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:15.050
Anytime, Lee.

00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:18.445
Three, two... one!

00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:03.142
Nice job.

00:19:17.025 --> 00:19:18.069
Dude, that was so cool!

00:19:18.244 --> 00:19:19.941
I mean, out of the sky?

00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:24.119
What are these?

00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:26.556
I said camping,
I didn't say horseback, did I?

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.776
- Everyone gets one?
- Yeah.

00:19:30.604 --> 00:19:34.260
Uh, that one's mine,
take one of the other ones.

00:19:37.698 --> 00:19:38.873
Not bad, huh?

00:20:14.996 --> 00:20:16.998
What do you do
for work now, Dad?

00:20:17.172 --> 00:20:19.783
He supplies armies
for rich people.

00:20:19.957 --> 00:20:21.698
I run a security firm.

00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:27.051
Were you in, like, every war?

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.793
He was in pretty much every one
in the last quarter century.

00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:33.265
What'd you do
to get your Medal of Honor?

00:20:33.362 --> 00:20:36.191
Did you have to kill people?

00:20:36.365 --> 00:20:38.106
You don't get the Medal of Honor

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.716
if you don't kill people.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.544
Yeah, you do.

00:20:41.718 --> 00:20:44.634
You get the Medal of Honor
for saving lives at war

00:20:44.808 --> 00:20:47.202
and putting your life in danger
while you're doing it.

00:20:47.376 --> 00:20:48.769
It wasn't a war.

00:20:48.943 --> 00:20:50.814
None of them were.

00:20:50.988 --> 00:20:53.208
Only Congress can declare war.

00:20:53.382 --> 00:20:55.776
Well, tell that to the men
and women who died there.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.517
Yeah, men and women

00:20:57.691 --> 00:20:59.582
who shouldn't have been there
in the first place.

00:20:59.606 --> 00:21:00.650
9/11?

00:21:00.824 --> 00:21:01.912
We were attacked?

00:21:02.783 --> 00:21:04.132
Were we?

00:21:04.306 --> 00:21:05.133
You seem pretty pissed for a kid

00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:07.222
who barely remembers 9/11.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.486
Barely remembers it.

00:21:12.836 --> 00:21:15.056
My whole life
has been about 9/11.

00:21:16.927 --> 00:21:18.967
Hey, we joined because
it was the right thing to do,

00:21:19.103 --> 00:21:20.801
- to protect our families.
- Yeah.

00:21:20.975 --> 00:21:22.335
Just like a lot
of other Americans,

00:21:22.455 --> 00:21:23.693
and I'd do it again, too, even...

00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:24.761
Uh-huh.

00:21:30.593 --> 00:21:32.160
- Goodnight, Dad.
- Goodnight.

00:21:38.253 --> 00:21:39.733
It's not your fault, about Dave.

00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:43.693
Yeah, I know.

00:21:46.043 --> 00:21:48.481
Boys screw up, Lee,
you gotta give him time.

00:21:49.177 --> 00:21:50.265
I know.

00:21:51.397 --> 00:21:54.008
It's what I'm here for.

00:21:54.182 --> 00:21:55.551
Why don't you just tell
Claire and the boys

00:21:55.575 --> 00:21:57.794
what really happened to you?

00:21:57.968 --> 00:22:00.319
The last thing
they need from me is whining.

00:22:00.493 --> 00:22:02.277
Might help 'em understand.

00:22:02.451 --> 00:22:04.279
Maybe they wouldn't
be quite so mad at you.

00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:08.151
Yeah.

00:22:08.283 --> 00:22:09.893
Not gonna bring Dave back.

00:22:11.025 --> 00:22:12.026
No, it wouldn't.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.593
Why don't you let me tell 'em?

00:22:13.767 --> 00:22:14.767
No.

00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:21.035
Lee, you are a hard case.

00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:39.836
- Dad?
- Yeah?

00:22:41.098 --> 00:22:42.099
You awake?

00:22:42.752 --> 00:22:43.840
Just.

00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:48.454
You all right?

00:22:49.672 --> 00:22:51.326
I heard something in the woods.

00:22:52.849 --> 00:22:54.242
Just an owl, I think.

00:22:55.983 --> 00:22:57.724
How do you know it's not a bear?

00:22:59.073 --> 00:23:00.335
Or a serial killer?

00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:04.600
'Cause my spidey sense
would be tingling.

00:23:04.774 --> 00:23:06.559
Even for a serial killer?

00:23:07.995 --> 00:23:09.039
Yeah.

00:23:12.086 --> 00:23:13.130
Dad?

00:23:15.306 --> 00:23:17.918
Why didn't you come home
when Dave was sick and died?

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.273
- I couldn't.
- Why?

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:32.106
I think that's why
Travis is mad at you.

00:23:35.762 --> 00:23:36.762
Do they hurt?

00:23:41.028 --> 00:23:42.028
Not anymore.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.727
I get it,

00:23:44.901 --> 00:23:46.555
you were on
a top secret mission,

00:23:46.729 --> 00:23:48.514
and you didn't want
to talk about it.

00:24:01.135 --> 00:24:02.135
Goodnight, Dad.

00:24:03.006 --> 00:24:04.007
Goodnight.

00:24:05.487 --> 00:24:06.487
I love you.

00:24:12.538 --> 00:24:13.538
I love you, too.

00:24:59.193 --> 00:25:00.368
Beautiful, huh?

00:25:03.023 --> 00:25:04.415
What's that smell?

00:25:07.157 --> 00:25:09.508
- You smell that?
- Yeah.

00:25:11.379 --> 00:25:12.206
Smells like...

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.512
Yeah, I know.

00:25:25.828 --> 00:25:27.613
Never seen this creek this dry.

00:25:29.702 --> 00:25:30.746
Hm.

00:25:32.879 --> 00:25:34.315
Hey, you two stay back.

00:25:36.752 --> 00:25:37.797
You hear that?

00:25:38.885 --> 00:25:40.016
Is that bees?

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.496
You know I hate bees.

00:25:43.672 --> 00:25:44.847
- Buzz.
- Stop!

00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:46.893
Stop, you're not funny, stop!

00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:48.242
Knock it off.

00:26:02.212 --> 00:26:03.997
Is it bees?

00:26:04.171 --> 00:26:05.868
No.
Then what is it?

00:26:06.042 --> 00:26:08.218
Just a bunch of flies
on a dead animal.

00:26:08.392 --> 00:26:09.437
Can I see?

00:26:10.786 --> 00:26:12.005
Just stay there.

00:26:12.179 --> 00:26:13.659
What kind of animal is it?

00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:16.400
Why can't I see a dead animal?

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:17.856
Because it will give you
a nightmare.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.880
No, it won't.

00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:33.243
Think somebody's
been siphoning the water

00:26:33.417 --> 00:26:34.680
from the creek.

00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:12.152
Get the others here.

00:27:26.296 --> 00:27:27.341
Holy shit.

00:27:28.864 --> 00:27:30.300
We're in the middle
of a drug lab.

00:27:32.694 --> 00:27:34.043
We need to get out of here.

00:27:51.278 --> 00:27:52.366
Ah, Jon.

00:28:01.984 --> 00:28:02.985
Ah, Jon.

00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:05.509
Jon.

00:28:08.121 --> 00:28:09.383
Travis!

00:28:09.557 --> 00:28:11.037
Travis!

00:28:13.387 --> 00:28:14.475
Bring me the med kit!

00:28:16.738 --> 00:28:17.783
Bring me a weapon!

00:28:17.957 --> 00:28:19.219
Travis! Weapon!

00:28:19.393 --> 00:28:20.393
Ah, hang in there, Jon.

00:28:24.485 --> 00:28:25.485
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:25.573 --> 00:28:27.793
Ah, here it is.

00:28:27.967 --> 00:28:29.596
I need you to ride down,
I need you to get...

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.057
Get some help, okay?

00:28:31.231 --> 00:28:34.321
- By myself?
- No, take your brother, okay?

00:28:34.495 --> 00:28:35.864
And listen,
when you get cell service,

00:28:35.888 --> 00:28:36.908
call the sheriff
and you tell him

00:28:36.932 --> 00:28:38.717
what happened here, okay?

00:28:38.891 --> 00:28:41.720
Tell him to bring a helicopter
and a trauma team, all right?

00:28:41.894 --> 00:28:43.243
Screenshot your GPS location.

00:28:43.417 --> 00:28:44.679
It shows exactly where we are.

00:28:44.853 --> 00:28:46.333
- Somebody's coming. Help!
- Shh! Shh!

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:48.988
Shh, they're coming for us.

00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:50.163
I need you to be strong.

00:28:50.337 --> 00:28:51.555
I need you to go right now.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.992
Now go.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:01.391
Let's go.

00:29:09.835 --> 00:29:12.185
Ah, yeah,
you're a tough bastard.

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:13.577
There you go, there you go.

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:14.752
There.

00:29:14.796 --> 00:29:16.450
Stay alive, okay?

00:29:16.624 --> 00:29:17.744
I'll give you some morphine.

00:29:19.192 --> 00:29:20.410
It's okay.

00:29:21.498 --> 00:29:22.935
Did my cock get blown off?

00:29:24.458 --> 00:29:25.676
I'm not going to inspect it.

00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:28.331
- I'm pretty sure.
- You sure?

00:29:28.505 --> 00:29:29.637
I'm cold.

00:29:29.811 --> 00:29:30.899
Damn it.

00:29:35.164 --> 00:29:37.079
Prop me up, brother.

00:29:37.253 --> 00:29:39.212
- I can slow 'em down.
- Stay alive, okay?

00:29:39.386 --> 00:29:40.626
I'm on my way, get out of here.

00:29:40.691 --> 00:29:41.799
I'm not gonna leave you, Jon.

00:29:41.823 --> 00:29:42.911
The boys need you.

00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:44.106
They already lost their brother.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.871
Get your ass out of here!

00:29:54.096 --> 00:29:55.228
Jon!

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:12.218
I think I see some people.

00:31:12.392 --> 00:31:13.392
Can you help us?

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.047
Our uncle is hurt real bad!

00:31:15.221 --> 00:31:16.439
Are those hunters?

00:31:19.442 --> 00:31:20.879
Those aren't hunters.

00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:36.546
Drop the gun!

00:31:39.462 --> 00:31:40.855
Slowly.

00:32:02.659 --> 00:32:04.183
On the ground!

00:32:04.357 --> 00:32:05.575
I said, "Get on the ground!"

00:32:10.624 --> 00:32:12.191
Ow!

00:33:25.307 --> 00:33:27.222
I'm impressed,
Mr. Gunner.

00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:29.877
I have your boys.

00:33:31.966 --> 00:33:33.185
Mr. Gunner.

00:33:36.797 --> 00:33:38.581
Looks like I'm down to...

00:33:39.582 --> 00:33:41.106
12 men.

00:33:47.503 --> 00:33:48.591
Yell to your father.

00:33:49.201 --> 00:33:50.550
Tom.

00:33:53.814 --> 00:33:55.468
Let's try this again.

00:33:55.642 --> 00:33:58.079
Yell to your father now.

00:33:59.254 --> 00:34:00.255
Dad...

00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:02.388
Dad!

00:34:02.562 --> 00:34:03.606
Dad!

00:34:04.216 --> 00:34:05.216
Dad!

00:34:06.392 --> 00:34:07.915
Dad!

00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:09.786
Drop your weapons,
Mr. Gunner...

00:34:11.745 --> 00:34:13.486
and I won't hurt 'em.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.576
I just want to finish packing
up the rest of my shipment

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.578
and move it out.

00:34:18.752 --> 00:34:21.189
That's all.
I will let them and you go.

00:34:21.363 --> 00:34:22.712
Have your word on that?

00:34:29.023 --> 00:34:30.024
Yes.

00:34:30.851 --> 00:34:32.070
You have my word.

00:34:52.481 --> 00:34:55.223
I just want to pack it up
and move it out.

00:34:58.966 --> 00:35:00.206
Don't you need to ask the boss?

00:35:07.453 --> 00:35:08.541
I'm the boss.

00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:11.326
They call me Dobbs.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.545
Okay, Dobbs.

00:35:15.548 --> 00:35:17.115
You listen to me.

00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:20.205
I'm telling you if you hurt
one hair on their head,

00:35:21.336 --> 00:35:22.729
small scratch, whatever...

00:35:22.903 --> 00:35:24.731
I know, I know, I know.

00:35:24.905 --> 00:35:27.560
I'll die a very painful,
excruciating,

00:35:27.734 --> 00:35:29.562
yada, yada, yada... listen, man.

00:35:29.736 --> 00:35:32.391
I have no reason
to harm a child.

00:35:32.565 --> 00:35:34.915
What? You think
I'm some kind of monster?

00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:38.092
I am sensitive to their feelings

00:35:38.266 --> 00:35:39.659
and yours.

00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:42.792
I will make sure
they get gluten-free

00:35:42.966 --> 00:35:45.665
peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches and fruit juice.

00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:47.406
Just do what I say.

00:35:51.758 --> 00:35:53.238
Nobody gets hurt.

00:36:03.683 --> 00:36:05.772
No, no.

00:36:05.946 --> 00:36:08.644
Have you noticed how
Mr. Eye of the Storm out there

00:36:08.818 --> 00:36:11.299
has easily fucked up or killed

00:36:11.473 --> 00:36:12.822
all my badass crew?

00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:14.868
Look at me.

00:36:15.042 --> 00:36:16.130
Don't be an idiot.

00:36:17.871 --> 00:36:20.830
I see the thought process
is above your pay grade.

00:36:21.004 --> 00:36:22.658
So, listen,

00:36:22.832 --> 00:36:24.356
the boys have to be alive

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.054
so we can deal
with Mr. War Hero.

00:36:27.228 --> 00:36:28.228
Do you understand?

00:36:30.797 --> 00:36:31.841
Now go.

00:36:33.016 --> 00:36:34.148
Go!

00:36:46.029 --> 00:36:48.728
I'm losing my patience,
Mr. Gunner.

00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:24.371
Fuck.

00:37:30.596 --> 00:37:31.814
This is the DEA.

00:37:31.988 --> 00:37:33.599
Drop your weapons.

00:37:33.773 --> 00:37:36.166
Drop your weapon
and lay down on the ground now.

00:37:36.341 --> 00:37:38.081
DEA!
Hands in the air!

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.040
Hands in the air!

00:37:44.087 --> 00:37:45.263
No, no, no.

00:37:45.437 --> 00:37:46.916
We said, "Put your hands up!"

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.440
No, no.

00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:51.312
They have my sons! Wait!

00:37:51.486 --> 00:37:52.748
Get on the ground!

00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:56.491
On the ground!

00:37:56.665 --> 00:37:57.797
They have my sons!

00:37:57.971 --> 00:38:00.713
Slowly put down the gun.

00:38:00.887 --> 00:38:03.237
Put your hands up,
you're surrounded!

00:38:03.411 --> 00:38:06.153
Bravo two to Delta one,
we have the area secure.

00:38:06.327 --> 00:38:08.286
The suspect is apprehended.

00:38:09.461 --> 00:38:10.897
No sudden movements!

00:38:12.202 --> 00:38:13.421
Uh, they have my sons!

00:38:13.595 --> 00:38:14.422
Shut up!

00:38:14.596 --> 00:38:15.989
What?

00:38:16.163 --> 00:38:17.556
I said, "Shut up!"

00:38:28.915 --> 00:38:30.482
He wounded
a dozen federal agents,

00:38:30.656 --> 00:38:31.676
three of which
are in the hospital

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.223
fighting for their lives.

00:38:33.398 --> 00:38:35.071
If they weren't wearing
their vests, they'd be dead.

00:38:35.095 --> 00:38:37.271
How about a little perspective?

00:38:37.445 --> 00:38:40.318
He's camping with his kids,
stepped into a drug lab.

00:38:40.492 --> 00:38:42.165
I don't know why
we're having this conversation.

00:38:42.189 --> 00:38:43.582
This is a federal investigation.

00:38:43.756 --> 00:38:45.356
You have no jurisdiction here
whatsoever.

00:38:45.453 --> 00:38:47.499
You're in my town
and a guest in my office,

00:38:47.673 --> 00:38:50.589
and I will exercise my judgment
any way I see fit.

00:38:53.592 --> 00:38:55.071
They have my boys, Bob.

00:38:56.377 --> 00:38:57.596
What are you talking about?

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:59.130
I sent Luke and Travis
to get help.

00:38:59.249 --> 00:39:01.034
Somebody grabbed them.

00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:02.775
Who are these guys?

00:39:03.558 --> 00:39:05.125
Shit.

00:39:05.299 --> 00:39:07.103
- Why am I locked up?
- How about the attempted murder

00:39:07.127 --> 00:39:08.737
of a dozen federal agents?

00:39:08.911 --> 00:39:10.913
I didn't know
they were federal agents.

00:39:11.087 --> 00:39:12.262
There was smoke everywhere.

00:39:12.437 --> 00:39:13.873
Men with guns were attacking me.

00:39:14.047 --> 00:39:16.745
Listen, let me out of here,
I need to get my boys.

00:39:16.919 --> 00:39:18.767
The only place you're going
is a federal detention center.

00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:19.531
Hey, Bob.

00:39:19.705 --> 00:39:20.705
Fuck!

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:27.103
You're not listening
to me, G-man.

00:39:30.542 --> 00:39:32.782
I just saw my brother-in-law
get blown up in front of me.

00:39:34.023 --> 00:39:35.460
Then some assholes took my kids.

00:39:42.205 --> 00:39:43.903
For God sakes, Lee...

00:39:46.558 --> 00:39:47.646
Please.

00:39:55.305 --> 00:39:58.091
Did my idiot lawyer
get a court date yet?

00:39:58.265 --> 00:39:59.614
He's getting there.

00:39:59.788 --> 00:40:01.442
What? By ox cart?

00:40:02.748 --> 00:40:04.140
It's taking forever.

00:40:04.314 --> 00:40:05.577
Says it's complicated.

00:40:05.751 --> 00:40:07.187
Yeah.

00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:09.668
At a thousand an hour,
he loves complicated.

00:40:09.842 --> 00:40:11.365
I'm in his ass every day, Pop.

00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:13.236
Well, use your spurs.

00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:14.629
Always.

00:40:14.803 --> 00:40:16.718
Got an alternate plan
to get you out

00:40:16.892 --> 00:40:17.980
if our lawyer fails.

00:40:18.154 --> 00:40:19.634
Anything else?

00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:23.464
In a bit of a hitch.

00:40:23.638 --> 00:40:24.900
What?

00:40:25.074 --> 00:40:26.119
Unforeseen.

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.427
I... I don't like surprises.

00:40:29.601 --> 00:40:31.559
No, and you won't like this one.

00:40:32.255 --> 00:40:33.779
A party crasher.

00:40:33.953 --> 00:40:35.868
You... you're gonna
have to explain that to me.

00:40:36.042 --> 00:40:39.915
Party crasher
took the food off the table.

00:40:40.089 --> 00:40:41.308
All of it?

00:40:41.482 --> 00:40:43.789
A fairly
substantial amount, yeah.

00:40:43.963 --> 00:40:45.530
Jesus Christ.

00:40:45.704 --> 00:40:47.464
How the fuck did you let
a thing like that happen?

00:40:47.488 --> 00:40:48.620
I don't know.

00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:50.752
Out of the blue.

00:40:50.926 --> 00:40:52.034
So what are you doing about it?

00:40:52.058 --> 00:40:53.799
I did it already.

00:40:53.973 --> 00:40:54.800
You'll get it back?

00:40:54.974 --> 00:40:55.801
I will get it back.

00:40:55.975 --> 00:40:56.975
How?

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.022
I have something he wants.

00:41:03.591 --> 00:41:05.463
I'm liking this less and less.

00:41:05.637 --> 00:41:07.508
It's the only way, believe me.

00:41:07.682 --> 00:41:09.162
He will trade.

00:41:10.772 --> 00:41:12.339
It's just a matter of logistics.

00:41:14.776 --> 00:41:16.952
Never leave anything to chance.

00:41:17.126 --> 00:41:18.432
How fucking many times...

00:41:18.606 --> 00:41:20.042
I haven't.

00:41:20.216 --> 00:41:22.915
That's why I did what I did.

00:41:23.089 --> 00:41:26.179
He will return all the food
to the table.

00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:28.224
He will have no choice.

00:41:29.748 --> 00:41:31.053
You don't know that.

00:41:31.227 --> 00:41:32.794
In this case, I do.

00:41:32.968 --> 00:41:36.276
Well, in this case...
In any case,

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:39.540
our guests will expect
to have all of the food

00:41:39.714 --> 00:41:41.934
on the table for dinner.

00:41:42.587 --> 00:41:43.587
I'm on it.

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:46.721
You say that easy enough.

00:41:46.895 --> 00:41:48.593
That's because I know.

00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:50.725
I know what I have.

00:41:50.899 --> 00:41:54.120
Unless, of course, you run
into another unforeseen hitch.

00:41:54.294 --> 00:41:55.600
Huh?

00:41:55.774 --> 00:41:58.864
The party will come off
as scheduled.

00:42:00.387 --> 00:42:02.128
Trust me.

00:42:02.302 --> 00:42:04.086
You listen to me on this.

00:42:05.131 --> 00:42:06.436
You see to it.

00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:08.743
All of it.

00:42:10.005 --> 00:42:11.224
On time.

00:42:12.486 --> 00:42:13.531
Understood?

00:42:14.923 --> 00:42:16.838
Look me in the eye, boy.

00:42:19.014 --> 00:42:20.189
Do you understand?

00:42:20.363 --> 00:42:22.583
I understand.

00:42:22.757 --> 00:42:25.107
Or do I have to replace you
with another chef?

00:42:26.239 --> 00:42:27.414
No.

00:42:27.588 --> 00:42:29.242
No, you don't.

00:42:29.416 --> 00:42:30.548
You're sure?

00:42:31.853 --> 00:42:32.898
I got this.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.076
Jon survived three tours of duty

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.078
and a year in the hospital,

00:42:39.252 --> 00:42:42.951
only to be killed
in our own backyard?

00:42:43.125 --> 00:42:45.301
Let me call you back.
Jail, Bob?

00:42:45.475 --> 00:42:48.043
It's not my call.

00:42:48.217 --> 00:42:50.698
Yeah, actually,
I'm in charge now, ma'am.

00:42:50.872 --> 00:42:52.091
Where are my sons?

00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:53.962
We have two
kidnapping specialists

00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:55.311
flying in right now.

00:42:55.485 --> 00:42:56.765
It's a very sensitive operation.

00:42:59.098 --> 00:43:00.229
Come on.

00:43:05.147 --> 00:43:06.322
Bring them back to me, Lee.

00:43:08.542 --> 00:43:12.415
I don't care what you do
or who you do it to...

00:43:13.503 --> 00:43:14.592
just bring them back.

00:43:27.169 --> 00:43:28.344
It's them.

00:43:30.259 --> 00:43:32.522
Mr. Gunner?
Yeah.

00:43:32.697 --> 00:43:34.960
Our little rendezvous
went south.

00:43:35.134 --> 00:43:37.049
- Where are they?
- If you do not do

00:43:37.223 --> 00:43:38.833
exactly as I say,

00:43:39.007 --> 00:43:40.966
my associates, who are not
as empathetic as I am,

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.532
and against my wishes,

00:43:42.707 --> 00:43:44.147
will do terrible things
to your boys.

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.145
If anything happens
to those boys,

00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:48.277
I will hunt you down,
I will find you,

00:43:48.451 --> 00:43:50.497
and I will inflict
more pain on you

00:43:50.671 --> 00:43:52.804
than you can possibly imagine.

00:43:52.978 --> 00:43:56.546
Oh, you're scaring me.

00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:59.462
I appreciate the fatherly
thing, I really do.

00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:01.639
Unfortunately,
the federal agents

00:44:01.813 --> 00:44:04.293
have confiscated my product.

00:44:04.467 --> 00:44:07.601
But I noticed that you're
an excessively resourceful man.

00:44:07.775 --> 00:44:10.952
You have 24 hours
to get it back to me.

00:44:11.126 --> 00:44:13.607
If I do not have it
by this time tomorrow,

00:44:13.781 --> 00:44:16.566
my associates will send
your sons' heads

00:44:16.741 --> 00:44:18.917
to their mother in a box.

00:44:27.795 --> 00:44:30.406
So, just let me
get this straight.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.670
You want us to give them
their fentanyl back?

00:44:32.844 --> 00:44:34.715
Just give 'em what they want.

00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:36.804
All right,
when they return the boys,

00:44:36.978 --> 00:44:39.348
I make it my mission to hunt
each and every one of them down.

00:44:39.372 --> 00:44:40.392
You think you're a one-man army?

00:44:40.416 --> 00:44:41.896
Do you believe this guy?

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:45.770
Well, so far,
it's Lee: 16 bad guys down.

00:44:45.944 --> 00:44:47.641
Bad guys: one.

00:44:47.815 --> 00:44:50.209
That's MVP trophy if you ask me.

00:44:50.383 --> 00:44:52.472
We're not giving them
their fentanyl back.

00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:56.955
I'm sorry, Lee.

00:44:58.347 --> 00:45:00.785
Nothing I can do,
it's a federal operation.

00:45:00.959 --> 00:45:02.874
Unlock the cell door, Bob.

00:45:03.048 --> 00:45:05.069
I know what you're thinking,
I'd be thinking the same thing

00:45:05.093 --> 00:45:06.660
if I were you.

00:45:06.834 --> 00:45:08.227
But it took a five-ton truck

00:45:08.401 --> 00:45:09.881
to haul those drugs out of there

00:45:10.055 --> 00:45:11.970
and you'll never get it
out of federal custody.

00:45:12.144 --> 00:45:13.275
What would you do?

00:45:13.885 --> 00:45:14.885
Huh?

00:45:14.929 --> 00:45:16.104
Your boys.

00:45:22.023 --> 00:45:23.895
Did you get a print analysis
from the lab?

00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:25.679
Well, how about you two
go over there

00:45:25.853 --> 00:45:27.202
and kick some ass?

00:45:34.383 --> 00:45:37.082
The men you're looking for
work for Kendrick Ryker.

00:45:37.256 --> 00:45:38.605
He's in the state prison,

00:45:38.779 --> 00:45:40.322
but I think
he's still calling the shots

00:45:40.346 --> 00:45:41.869
through his son, Dobbs.

00:45:42.043 --> 00:45:43.741
There's this biker gang
that works for him

00:45:43.915 --> 00:45:45.220
out of Williamsburg.

00:45:45.394 --> 00:45:47.179
There's a lot of money
in that drug.

00:45:47.353 --> 00:45:48.753
People are afraid
to go in the parks

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.573
or the national forest anymore.

00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:53.011
The biker gang there
out of Chinatown,

00:45:53.185 --> 00:45:55.578
they traffic and transport
all over the South.

00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:57.537
They hired a guy
named Billy Scott.

00:45:57.711 --> 00:46:00.105
He's got trucks they use
to haul the stuff off.

00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:14.380
I know Billy hangs out
at the Red Tail strip club.

00:46:28.568 --> 00:46:29.787
Pickup is out back.

00:46:32.311 --> 00:46:33.791
You're a good man, Bob.

00:46:33.965 --> 00:46:34.965
Just go get 'em.

00:47:14.353 --> 00:47:15.963
One of you guys is Billy Scott?

00:47:21.577 --> 00:47:23.492
Who's asking?

00:47:23.666 --> 00:47:25.340
I just want to have
a couple words with you,

00:47:25.364 --> 00:47:26.364
that's all.

00:47:52.347 --> 00:47:54.393
Two nights ago, you're in a bar
with three guys

00:47:54.567 --> 00:47:56.090
and one of 'em
gave you some money.

00:47:56.264 --> 00:47:58.144
You got me mixed up
with somebody else, asshole.

00:47:58.179 --> 00:47:59.789
Bullshit! Where are they?

00:47:59.964 --> 00:48:01.530
I don't know. I don't!

00:48:01.704 --> 00:48:03.358
- Just give me a name.
- I swear to God.

00:48:03.532 --> 00:48:04.838
Give me a name!

00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:07.275
We didn't do names.

00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:10.799
Well...

00:48:18.504 --> 00:48:20.114
Who's your daddy now?

00:48:31.952 --> 00:48:33.475
Let's try this again.

00:48:33.649 --> 00:48:35.608
One of those guys
gave you a roll of cash.

00:48:35.782 --> 00:48:36.826
What'd he pay you for?

00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:38.001
I can't tell you that.

00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:40.178
- They'll kill me.
- Yeah?

00:48:40.352 --> 00:48:42.267
They might.

00:48:42.441 --> 00:48:43.841
But I'll kill you
right fucking now.

00:48:43.877 --> 00:48:47.098
Okay. Okay, just hold on.

00:48:47.272 --> 00:48:50.101
I hauled some supplies for 'em
a couple of months ago.

00:48:50.275 --> 00:48:52.190
And they're just paying you now?

00:48:52.364 --> 00:48:56.368
I... I rented an old factory
for 'em a couple of days ago

00:48:56.542 --> 00:48:58.413
and got some workers for 'em.

00:48:58.587 --> 00:48:59.980
To do what?

00:49:00.154 --> 00:49:03.070
- To do what?
- To process and pack their fen.

00:49:03.244 --> 00:49:04.637
Where's the factory?

00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:06.331
I can't tell you that,
they'll kill me.

00:49:11.078 --> 00:49:12.427
God damn it!

00:49:12.601 --> 00:49:13.907
What is wrong with you, man?

00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:15.300
That burns!

00:49:15.474 --> 00:49:17.171
You lucky son of a bitch.

00:49:17.345 --> 00:49:18.564
Rock salt.

00:49:18.738 --> 00:49:20.522
You got anger issues, man!

00:49:20.696 --> 00:49:22.872
You need to take some tablets
or something.

00:49:23.699 --> 00:49:26.006
Okay. Okay, okay.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.487
It's an old ironworks factory.

00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:31.577
- Where is it?
- Five miles off a dirt road,

00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:33.100
off of Confederate.

00:49:37.452 --> 00:49:39.933
They're gonna want
to fucking kill you.

00:49:40.107 --> 00:49:42.283
Well, they can stand
in a very long line.

00:49:44.503 --> 00:49:45.983
Ow, man, that burns.

00:49:46.157 --> 00:49:48.159
Man, that was my good leg.

00:49:53.773 --> 00:49:56.863
Well, we always knew when
one of our labs were found.

00:49:57.037 --> 00:49:58.232
We have more than enough
for our buyers

00:49:58.256 --> 00:49:59.648
and we're still on schedule.

00:50:04.392 --> 00:50:06.742
'Cause I needed him to see
that I saved the day.

00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:21.757
That's very astute of you.

00:50:29.548 --> 00:50:31.202
Call in the vans.

00:50:31.376 --> 00:50:32.638
Move everything to our back-up.

00:50:34.596 --> 00:50:35.596
Follow the plan.

00:50:41.342 --> 00:50:43.257
Not a chance in Hell.

00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:45.607
But he'll fuck with the DEA
long enough

00:50:45.781 --> 00:50:48.349
for us to finish our packaging
and get our shipment out.

00:50:57.141 --> 00:50:58.533
Let's play a little game.

00:51:02.233 --> 00:51:04.104
Cell phones, gentlemen.

00:51:12.156 --> 00:51:13.287
Unlock it.

00:51:21.295 --> 00:51:22.601
Still texting that skank?

00:51:27.823 --> 00:51:29.869
Outcall, massage therapist.

00:51:30.043 --> 00:51:31.175
Again.

00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:45.666
Unlock it.

00:51:46.886 --> 00:51:48.235
Hawaiian pizza.

00:51:48.409 --> 00:51:51.456
Extra bacon and a roadie.

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.240
Three times yesterday.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:03.598
My bad.

00:52:03.772 --> 00:52:05.731
My bad. I was wrong.

00:52:06.906 --> 00:52:08.255
Nobody in my crew.

00:52:26.665 --> 00:52:27.492
Bob?

00:52:27.666 --> 00:52:29.320
Did you find him?

00:52:29.494 --> 00:52:30.669
It's me.

00:52:31.539 --> 00:52:33.411
Yes.

00:52:33.585 --> 00:52:34.977
I'll call you
when I have the boys.

00:53:01.003 --> 00:53:02.353
No. No, what are you doing?

00:53:02.527 --> 00:53:03.745
Don't touch him!

00:53:03.919 --> 00:53:05.530
No, don't touch him!

00:53:05.704 --> 00:53:07.662
Luke! Luke! Luke!

00:53:09.229 --> 00:53:10.229
Luke!

00:53:54.318 --> 00:53:55.884
Put down the gun slowly.

00:56:27.732 --> 00:56:29.864
No, hey, it's me, it's okay.

00:56:30.038 --> 00:56:31.823
You all right?
Did they hurt you?

00:56:31.997 --> 00:56:32.997
They took Luke.

00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:34.129
Agh.

00:56:35.914 --> 00:56:37.002
Come on.

00:56:37.176 --> 00:56:38.438
They say where they were going?

00:56:38.612 --> 00:56:40.012
I don't know,
but we gotta save him.

00:56:51.843 --> 00:56:53.801
Now, you listen to me, okay?

00:56:53.975 --> 00:56:55.847
You know what
these guys are, right?

00:56:56.021 --> 00:56:57.849
You put your hands up
and you walk toward 'em.

00:56:58.023 --> 00:56:59.459
What are you gonna do?

00:56:59.633 --> 00:57:00.654
They'll keep you safe,
don't worry about me.

00:57:00.678 --> 00:57:02.331
I gotta find Luke, okay?

00:57:02.506 --> 00:57:03.724
On the ground!

00:57:03.898 --> 00:57:05.770
Hands in the air!

00:57:05.944 --> 00:57:07.293
Go.

00:57:07.467 --> 00:57:10.078
- Walk toward 'em.
- Hands in the air, now!

00:57:15.649 --> 00:57:16.649
Don't hurt my boy.

00:57:16.737 --> 00:57:17.956
He's unarmed.

00:57:19.566 --> 00:57:20.785
Take off your shirt.

00:57:23.875 --> 00:57:25.746
I need to see
that you're unarmed.

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.095
Do it.

00:57:40.152 --> 00:57:41.152
Come on, kid.

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:44.156
Down, down, get down.

00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:45.330
Go.

00:57:45.374 --> 00:57:46.550
Hey. Hey!

00:57:46.724 --> 00:57:48.290
Hey. Stop!

00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:49.465
Stop!

00:57:52.033 --> 00:57:53.033
Stop!

00:58:05.394 --> 00:58:07.484
They killed our man Kang!

00:59:32.917 --> 00:59:34.745
Time to eat.

00:59:34.919 --> 00:59:36.181
I'm not hungry.

00:59:36.355 --> 00:59:37.791
You can't let
your blood sugar drop

00:59:37.965 --> 00:59:39.097
under all this stress.

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.187
You're still in
your growing years.

00:59:47.932 --> 00:59:49.150
See?

00:59:52.066 --> 00:59:53.633
Tell me about your father.

00:59:54.808 --> 00:59:56.636
What about him?

00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:58.290
He's some kind of
war hero, right?

00:59:58.464 --> 01:00:00.031
He won a Medal of Honor.

01:00:00.205 --> 01:00:01.206
Really?

01:00:02.642 --> 01:00:03.861
For what?

01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:08.197
My brother says for killing
a bunch of asshole bad guys

01:00:08.343 --> 01:00:09.388
like you.

01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:16.613
That's what your brother says?

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.312
Look at the mouth on you.

01:00:22.706 --> 01:00:23.924
I killed a lot of guys,

01:00:24.098 --> 01:00:25.665
ain't nobody
ever gave me no medal.

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:29.887
My dad did it
to protect America.

01:00:30.061 --> 01:00:32.150
You're some criminal
that does it for money.

01:00:34.108 --> 01:00:35.283
How old are you?

01:00:36.676 --> 01:00:37.764
Ten.

01:00:37.938 --> 01:00:39.636
I remember when I was ten.

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:44.379
I bet you want to grow up
to be like him too, huh?

01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:49.341
Yeah. I do.

01:01:06.227 --> 01:01:07.402
Be careful.

01:02:18.996 --> 01:02:20.345
Anyone follow you?

01:02:20.519 --> 01:02:23.130
No. I cut through the woods
like you said.

01:02:23.304 --> 01:02:24.717
I need you to look up
everything you can

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.394
about a convict named Ryker.

01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:34.663
I wish I had
a map of the prison.

01:02:35.664 --> 01:02:36.840
Yeah. Map? Got it.

01:02:48.677 --> 01:02:51.463
They gave me the number for
a Ranger I served with, Sean.

01:02:51.637 --> 01:02:54.118
He lives outside
of Springfield city.

01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:56.555
You tell him exactly
what I told you, okay?

01:02:56.729 --> 01:02:58.209
You're really trusting me
with a lot.

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:00.341
Shouldn't I?

01:03:03.431 --> 01:03:04.911
What?

01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:07.392
I guess I'm just sorry
about all the attitude

01:03:07.566 --> 01:03:09.046
I've been throwing at you.

01:03:11.396 --> 01:03:12.832
Forget it.

01:03:13.006 --> 01:03:15.052
I just resent
the way you cut Dave off.

01:03:18.098 --> 01:03:19.796
- Okay.
- I don't get it.

01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:24.235
He thought
you'd lost faith in him.

01:03:26.585 --> 01:03:29.240
I never lost faith in him.

01:03:29.414 --> 01:03:32.025
The very thought of him
and you boys kept me alive.

01:03:32.199 --> 01:03:33.940
What happened?

01:03:34.114 --> 01:03:36.116
Were you on a mission?

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:37.552
You went missing for a year.

01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:39.032
We thought you were dead.

01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:41.643
He loved you so much.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.732
He wanted to be just like you.

01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:45.604
Only he couldn't.

01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:47.606
He went to Afghanistan

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:51.001
and he got blown up in a Jeep
his first week.

01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:57.398
Then the doctor gave him
those painkillers, and...

01:03:58.225 --> 01:03:59.444
he got hooked.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.100
So after the doc cut him off,

01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:05.189
he got some fen illegally.

01:04:06.538 --> 01:04:07.931
The dose killed him.

01:04:11.325 --> 01:04:12.718
We're almost over the drop site.

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.024
Get ready.

01:04:24.034 --> 01:04:25.949
I'm sorry you've had
to grow up so fast.

01:04:35.567 --> 01:04:36.873
Your girlfriend seems nice.

01:04:37.047 --> 01:04:38.047
She is.

01:04:40.354 --> 01:04:42.095
You need to respect her
a little more, yeah?

01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:43.575
Yes, sir.

01:04:50.712 --> 01:04:51.757
Good luck, Lee.

01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:44.331
All prisoners get down
on the ground.

01:05:44.505 --> 01:05:45.942
This is a lockdown.

01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:56.169
Lie face-down on your stomach
with your hands open

01:05:56.343 --> 01:05:57.954
and above your head.

01:06:05.787 --> 01:06:07.441
Come on. Let's roll.

01:06:26.895 --> 01:06:29.463
Get down on the ground
or you will be shot.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.870
Get down on the ground.

01:06:45.044 --> 01:06:48.700
Any resistance will put you
in solitary confinement.

01:06:50.702 --> 01:06:53.487
I repeat: All prisoners
get down on the ground.

01:06:53.661 --> 01:06:55.228
This is a lockdown.

01:06:55.402 --> 01:06:56.925
Lie face-down on your stomach

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.189
with your hands open
and above your head.

01:07:53.895 --> 01:07:55.636
Where do you think you're goin'?

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.247
I have a message for Ryker.

01:07:58.683 --> 01:08:00.032
I don't think so.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.994
Ooh.

01:08:06.169 --> 01:08:09.259
Boy, you sure know
how to make an entrance.

01:08:09.433 --> 01:08:12.349
That was very exciting.

01:08:12.523 --> 01:08:15.613
Never knew of a man who
wanted to break into prison.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:19.834
All right, all right.

01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:22.010
Obviously, he can kick your ass.

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:24.012
Lay off.

01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:26.145
I'm curious to know
what the man wants.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.104
Your son sent me to get you out.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.106
My son sent you.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.411
That's right.

01:08:31.585 --> 01:08:32.847
To get me out.

01:08:33.021 --> 01:08:34.414
That's what I said.

01:08:35.676 --> 01:08:38.853
So... how you gonna do that?

01:08:41.682 --> 01:08:43.075
I'm gonna walk you out,

01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:45.164
straight through
the fuckin' fence.

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:47.253
Wow.

01:08:47.427 --> 01:08:49.603
Can't say I'm not intrigued.

01:09:16.717 --> 01:09:17.805
Come on, get out!

01:09:28.816 --> 01:09:30.142
Lee Gunner just broke out
Kendrick Ryker

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.341
from Jackson State Prison.

01:09:31.515 --> 01:09:33.256
That doesn't surprise me.

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:34.735
It's the father.

01:09:34.909 --> 01:09:37.564
Of the man who took
Lee Gunner's sons.

01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:39.087
Who the hell is Gunner?

01:09:39.262 --> 01:09:41.002
He's a goddamned Green Beret.

01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:42.830
Booyah!

01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:46.007
I spent five years putting
Kendrick Ryker behind bars.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:48.314
He killed two federal agents,
both friends of mine.

01:09:48.488 --> 01:09:53.276
And your Green Beret just put
a psychopath drug lord murderer

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:54.973
back on the streets!

01:09:55.147 --> 01:09:56.757
To save his ten-year-old boy.

01:10:20.651 --> 01:10:22.609
Now, I know my son
wouldn't want you

01:10:22.783 --> 01:10:24.132
to handle it this way.

01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:26.222
Probably not.

01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:29.312
He doesn't know, does he?

01:10:31.444 --> 01:10:32.532
Get in.

01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:35.795
Just like that.

01:10:35.927 --> 01:10:37.276
You wanna get pinched?

01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:39.017
I want you to show
some fuckin' respect.

01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:42.455
You gotta earn
your fuckin' respect.

01:10:42.629 --> 01:10:44.109
- Put this on.
- Oh, no, knock it off.

01:10:44.283 --> 01:10:46.198
The fuck am I gonna do? Run?

01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:50.942
After you.

01:11:07.741 --> 01:11:08.742
You intact?

01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:11.528
So far.

01:11:11.702 --> 01:11:13.312
It's damn good
to see you, brother.

01:11:16.968 --> 01:11:18.056
Thanks for your help.

01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:19.623
You kiddin' me?

01:11:19.797 --> 01:11:20.885
I owe you.

01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:23.844
Man, we all do.

01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:25.368
What's he talking about?

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:29.458
Nothin'.

01:11:29.589 --> 01:11:31.548
Your dad

01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:33.898
took out an entire
Al-Qaeda command,

01:11:34.072 --> 01:11:35.291
singlehanded.

01:11:37.728 --> 01:11:38.772
Saved our squad.

01:11:42.646 --> 01:11:44.517
Got captured in the process.

01:11:50.088 --> 01:11:51.568
How long were you held?

01:11:55.267 --> 01:11:56.267
Year.

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.459
You escaped, didn't you?

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.467
Main roads all have roadblocks,

01:12:21.641 --> 01:12:24.122
but there's an old service road
that nobody uses anymore.

01:12:24.296 --> 01:12:26.080
It'll take us back
to the highway.

01:12:46.274 --> 01:12:47.794
You'll change your clothes
in the Jeep.

01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:52.237
I don't like
the way this is going.

01:12:57.764 --> 01:12:58.983
Get dressed.

01:13:04.684 --> 01:13:05.964
I'll text you where we're going.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.122
You need to bring
the DEA there, okay?

01:13:08.296 --> 01:13:10.429
- You need me.
- Yeah. I do.

01:13:10.603 --> 01:13:11.952
I need you to do this.

01:13:13.606 --> 01:13:15.608
So where do you want me?

01:13:15.782 --> 01:13:17.784
Sean, you've done enough,
all right?

01:13:17.958 --> 01:13:20.483
Aw, brother, it ain't enough
until I help you get Luke back.

01:13:20.657 --> 01:13:22.485
I appreciate the offer,
I really do.

01:13:22.659 --> 01:13:24.008
Man, I can still shoot, okay?

01:13:24.182 --> 01:13:25.488
Not as good as before,

01:13:25.662 --> 01:13:27.925
but you're kinda
shorthanded out here.

01:13:28.099 --> 01:13:29.903
There's gonna be a lot
of people looking for us.

01:13:29.927 --> 01:13:31.232
It would do me a bigger favor

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.887
if you could
throw 'em off our tracks.

01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:37.543
I guess I can do that.

01:13:37.717 --> 01:13:39.284
- Next time.
- Be safe.

01:13:40.807 --> 01:13:41.982
Let's go, kid.

01:13:54.081 --> 01:13:55.169
Hey.

01:13:56.693 --> 01:13:57.868
Who's Luke?

01:13:59.696 --> 01:14:02.699
And what is all this bullshit
about my son sending you?

01:14:02.873 --> 01:14:04.657
Your son took my son.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.531
You mean he kidnapped him?

01:14:08.705 --> 01:14:10.663
Yeah. Stupid thing to do.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.842
So, you're planning
to trade me for him.

01:14:16.016 --> 01:14:18.062
Correct.

01:14:18.236 --> 01:14:20.412
What makes you think
he'll trade?

01:14:20.586 --> 01:14:21.979
You're his father.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.722
You don't know him very well.

01:14:25.896 --> 01:14:27.463
I don't know your son at all,

01:14:27.637 --> 01:14:28.997
but I know
that if he hurts my boy,

01:14:29.029 --> 01:14:30.770
then I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

01:14:30.944 --> 01:14:33.033
And I'll kill you,
kill everyone you know.

01:14:33.207 --> 01:14:34.905
Oh!

01:14:35.079 --> 01:14:37.124
That's a lot of killing
for one man.

01:15:05.109 --> 01:15:06.806
Yeah?

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.765
I'm with the man
whose son you have.

01:15:12.812 --> 01:15:14.466
Dad?

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.425
Um, don't worry,
I got your back.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.731
Can you get away from him?

01:15:18.905 --> 01:15:20.603
Get away from him?

01:15:20.777 --> 01:15:22.387
Hell, I'm about to hire him.

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:24.563
Turn over
the family business to him.

01:15:24.737 --> 01:15:26.391
Shit.

01:15:26.565 --> 01:15:28.654
You ain't worth nothin'.

01:15:28.828 --> 01:15:30.047
He got me out of prison

01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.962
without calling
one fuckin' lawyer.

01:15:32.136 --> 01:15:33.833
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing business.

01:15:34.007 --> 01:15:36.140
- You got played.
- Everything is on track

01:15:36.314 --> 01:15:38.142
and going as planned,
even as we speak.

01:15:38.316 --> 01:15:39.709
Oh!

01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:42.276
Is me being held hostage
part of your plan?

01:15:44.278 --> 01:15:46.193
- No.
- Listen.

01:15:46.367 --> 01:15:48.979
This guy is not fighting
for God and country anymore.

01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:51.938
He's fighting for family.

01:15:52.112 --> 01:15:54.071
Guy like that
is not afraid to die.

01:15:54.245 --> 01:15:56.464
Makes him very dangerous.

01:15:56.639 --> 01:15:58.989
Yeah, well,
I'm pretty dangerous myself.

01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:00.338
Well, you better talk to him.

01:16:00.512 --> 01:16:01.992
He wants to make a deal.

01:16:03.646 --> 01:16:04.864
Your father for Luke.

01:16:05.038 --> 01:16:06.213
Straight trade.

01:16:06.387 --> 01:16:07.867
Listen.

01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:10.130
Hey, now, well played, Colonel.

01:16:10.304 --> 01:16:11.349
Where's my product?

01:16:11.523 --> 01:16:12.523
Listen.

01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:13.960
I have your father.

01:16:14.134 --> 01:16:15.694
You want him alive
or you want him dead?

01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:22.665
You seem to have me
at a disadvantage now.

01:16:25.232 --> 01:16:26.233
'Cause I want him.

01:16:26.407 --> 01:16:27.407
Where?

01:16:27.539 --> 01:16:29.193
Abandoned furnace.

01:16:29.367 --> 01:16:31.238
Fifty miles
south of Springfield.

01:16:31.412 --> 01:16:33.458
The old man knows the location.

01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:35.242
And please, um...

01:16:36.548 --> 01:16:38.158
be gentle to dear old Dad.

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:45.383
I like this guy!

01:16:49.648 --> 01:16:52.695
Your pops is
a very smart soldier.

01:16:52.869 --> 01:16:54.479
Too bad I'm gonna have
to kill him.

01:16:59.397 --> 01:17:00.746
Just came in from BOLO.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.313
- Sighting a Lee Gunner.
- Where?

01:17:02.487 --> 01:17:04.228
A farm just outside
of Crescent City.

01:17:04.402 --> 01:17:05.795
It's owned by a Sean Keller.

01:17:05.969 --> 01:17:09.189
Keller and Gunner served
in Afghanistan together.

01:17:09.363 --> 01:17:10.363
What are you waiting for?

01:17:10.495 --> 01:17:11.627
Which way now?

01:17:13.237 --> 01:17:14.891
Keep going.
It's a few miles.

01:17:15.065 --> 01:17:16.675
And then what?

01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:18.068
Then I'll tell you what.

01:17:18.242 --> 01:17:19.983
Prefer you just told me now.

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:26.685
Tell me this.

01:17:26.859 --> 01:17:28.687
What kind of a father are you?

01:17:30.254 --> 01:17:31.516
Not a very good one.

01:17:32.865 --> 01:17:34.475
Honest man.

01:17:35.694 --> 01:17:37.435
Has to be that way, too.

01:17:37.609 --> 01:17:41.918
I mean, what kind of a father
lets his son get kidnapped?

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.008
What kind of father
lets his boy be

01:17:45.182 --> 01:17:47.880
a drug dealer
and a kidnapper, hm?

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.276
I raised my boy
to be resourceful.

01:17:53.016 --> 01:17:54.234
I didn't.

01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:56.410
But mine just
turned out that way.

01:17:56.584 --> 01:17:57.673
Uh-huh.

01:17:57.847 --> 01:17:59.370
What's up ahead?

01:17:59.544 --> 01:18:00.850
You'll come to a fork.

01:18:01.024 --> 01:18:02.025
You take a left.

01:18:02.199 --> 01:18:03.635
You know, if this is an ambush,

01:18:03.809 --> 01:18:05.724
I'm gonna have to put
a bullet in your head.

01:18:05.898 --> 01:18:08.988
Aww, don't be that way.

01:18:09.162 --> 01:18:11.904
We both want this
to go right, don't we?

01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:14.559
Personally, I don't give a shit
what you want.

01:18:17.867 --> 01:18:20.521
I don't see why
this couldn't be friendlier.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.480
Oh, I see a few reasons why.

01:18:26.005 --> 01:18:27.137
We got stuff in common.

01:18:27.311 --> 01:18:28.529
Yeah, like what?

01:18:29.530 --> 01:18:30.530
Fatherhood.

01:18:31.924 --> 01:18:34.187
Yeah, raising a boy
is hard work.

01:18:34.927 --> 01:18:36.320
Right?

01:18:36.494 --> 01:18:38.888
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

01:18:39.062 --> 01:18:41.847
Especially when you're busy
being a soldier boy, right?

01:18:42.021 --> 01:18:43.196
Yeah.

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:45.764
Or a drug lord
piece of shit, huh?

01:18:47.635 --> 01:18:50.421
You use that kind of language
with your boys, do ya?

01:18:51.814 --> 01:18:53.250
Man, we're not so different.

01:18:54.599 --> 01:18:56.209
You keep tellin' yourself that.

01:18:59.822 --> 01:19:01.214
It's a goddamn wild goose chase.

01:19:02.999 --> 01:19:04.565
Sheriff found
their processing plant.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.915
Where?

01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:08.265
The old ironworks,
south of Clinton.

01:19:08.439 --> 01:19:10.746
Witnesses saw two trucks
surrounded by bikers

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:11.921
headed there now.

01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:17.160
So, why did my son
take your son?

01:20:17.334 --> 01:20:20.206
You... you take something
from him, hm?

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:21.380
No.

01:20:22.513 --> 01:20:24.080
No, we were just camping.

01:20:24.254 --> 01:20:26.560
We accidentally tripped over
his lab.

01:20:26.734 --> 01:20:27.953
I guess I should say your lab.

01:20:28.127 --> 01:20:29.607
Hm, hm.

01:20:29.781 --> 01:20:31.522
Just bad luck.

01:20:31.696 --> 01:20:33.132
Nobody goes near the lab.

01:20:33.306 --> 01:20:35.221
Yeah.

01:20:35.395 --> 01:20:37.745
Well, thing is sucking up all
the water out of the stream,

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.052
killing the forest
and the animals.

01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:44.274
Cost of doing business.

01:20:44.448 --> 01:20:46.929
Business, huh?

01:20:47.103 --> 01:20:51.324
So, you just walked a boy
right into it, huh?

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:54.850
Your son took my boys.

01:20:55.024 --> 01:20:56.286
Killed my friend Jon.

01:20:57.722 --> 01:21:00.246
Jon served his country
faithfully,

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.858
lost half his leg doing it.

01:21:03.032 --> 01:21:04.990
He didn't deserve to die
the way he did.

01:21:05.164 --> 01:21:07.166
Hm, well...

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:09.386
"deserves" got nothing to do
with business.

01:21:11.083 --> 01:21:13.172
You keep using
that word "business", huh?

01:21:13.346 --> 01:21:14.782
I guess you mean crime.

01:21:16.697 --> 01:21:19.222
Good people fighting and dying
every day in this country,

01:21:20.136 --> 01:21:21.311
for this country.

01:21:22.399 --> 01:21:24.183
Assholes like you rape it.

01:21:24.357 --> 01:21:25.968
There's that language again.

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.886
Here's the fork
I told you about.

01:21:48.555 --> 01:21:50.035
I'm sorry about your friend.

01:21:53.082 --> 01:21:54.082
No, you're not.

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:06.356
Half payment now.

01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:07.923
You'll get the rest on delivery.

01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:12.710
I'll have it to you in Reno
in a few days.

01:22:35.733 --> 01:22:36.733
You gonna hog that?

01:22:40.172 --> 01:22:41.782
Now, come on, man,
a little drink.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.262
It's been a while.

01:22:51.357 --> 01:22:52.489
Ah.

01:22:52.663 --> 01:22:53.663
Excuse me.

01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:57.102
Business is boomin'.

01:23:00.279 --> 01:23:01.279
Yeah?

01:23:05.545 --> 01:23:06.546
Yeah, I'm outside.

01:23:07.895 --> 01:23:09.245
Where's my father?

01:23:10.289 --> 01:23:11.289
Where's my son?

01:23:12.422 --> 01:23:13.684
My father first.

01:23:14.772 --> 01:23:16.295
Is there a problem?

01:23:16.469 --> 01:23:17.818
Not at all.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.211
I'll see you in Reno, my man.

01:23:20.604 --> 01:23:22.867
Hey, Chao, Tung, with me.

01:23:31.267 --> 01:23:33.486
Man, what's this
supposed to prove?

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:36.968
Look, it's not your problem
unless your son screws up,

01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:38.622
in which case
it becomes your problem.

01:23:38.796 --> 01:23:39.796
Mm.

01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:41.754
What about him?

01:23:41.842 --> 01:23:43.148
He ever screw up?

01:23:43.322 --> 01:23:45.498
All the time.

01:23:45.672 --> 01:23:47.326
But he's smarter than you think.

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.719
Well, he'd have to be.

01:23:50.286 --> 01:23:51.852
Just walk and do as I say,
all right?

01:23:53.376 --> 01:23:54.942
This is not the way to go
with Dobbs.

01:23:56.901 --> 01:24:00.035
Listen, all you have to worry
about is how to go with me.

01:24:00.209 --> 01:24:01.209
Come on.

01:24:23.971 --> 01:24:25.495
I don't like the bag.

01:24:33.329 --> 01:24:34.417
Put Luke on the phone.

01:24:37.028 --> 01:24:38.028
Luke, you all right?

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.378
Anybody hurt you?

01:24:40.466 --> 01:24:41.685
No.

01:24:41.859 --> 01:24:43.643
But I'm scared.

01:24:43.817 --> 01:24:45.497
Just hold on, all right,
I'll be over soon.

01:24:47.169 --> 01:24:48.169
No! Dad, Dad!

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:50.172
Dad!

01:24:51.695 --> 01:24:53.697
How 'bout you drop that shotgun?

01:24:53.871 --> 01:24:55.438
Eh, I kind of like it
where it is.

01:25:04.795 --> 01:25:05.796
Get out of here.

01:25:07.145 --> 01:25:08.145
Let's go.

01:25:14.935 --> 01:25:16.241
Luke!

01:25:16.415 --> 01:25:17.590
Run!

01:25:43.268 --> 01:25:44.268
Take him out.

01:25:55.019 --> 01:25:56.107
Take him out!

01:25:56.281 --> 01:25:57.281
Come on, let's move!

01:25:59.458 --> 01:26:00.498
Hey, where you goin', kid?

01:26:01.504 --> 01:26:02.809
Dad! Dad!

01:26:02.983 --> 01:26:04.420
- Luke!
- Take him out!

01:26:04.594 --> 01:26:05.594
Kill him!

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:07.900
Kill him!

01:27:15.099 --> 01:27:16.274
He killed my father.

01:27:39.428 --> 01:27:40.472
You see him, you kill him.

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:12.678
Dad!

01:29:34.456 --> 01:29:36.066
- Fuck!
- Dad! Dad!

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.503
Chao, you still remember
how to fly?

01:29:38.677 --> 01:29:39.677
- Yeah.
- Come on, kid.

01:29:41.071 --> 01:29:42.135
We got minutes, man,
let's fire this puppy up.

01:29:42.159 --> 01:29:43.334
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

01:30:52.925 --> 01:30:54.710
Hold your fire, hold your fire.

01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:24.435
- What's gonna happen to me?
- I don't know.

01:31:24.609 --> 01:31:26.326
Maybe we'll go to McDonald's
and get you a Happy Meal.

01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:27.394
Shut up.

01:31:38.667 --> 01:31:40.320
You speak like that
to my son again,

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:41.887
I'll put a bullet in your brain.

01:31:42.061 --> 01:31:43.061
Believe that.

01:31:57.163 --> 01:31:58.163
You all right?

01:32:07.347 --> 01:32:08.435
Stay down, okay?

01:32:12.265 --> 01:32:13.876
Hey, Luke.

01:32:14.050 --> 01:32:16.008
Tell your daddy
heroes don't hide.

01:33:30.474 --> 01:33:31.649
Fuck.

01:34:09.165 --> 01:34:10.296
Shh.

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:48.030
Luke, don't look.

01:34:58.257 --> 01:34:59.257
Fuck.

01:35:13.795 --> 01:35:14.955
Time to take out the garbage.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.102
No!

01:35:32.944 --> 01:35:34.424
Don't!

01:35:49.395 --> 01:35:50.483
No, no, no, no, no!

01:36:12.027 --> 01:36:13.637
Come on, we gotta get out.

01:37:19.529 --> 01:37:21.226
They had to drop
all the charges.

01:37:23.098 --> 01:37:24.447
You all right?

01:37:24.621 --> 01:37:25.840
Yeah.

01:37:26.014 --> 01:37:28.364
I'm banged up,
but, uh, I'm good.

01:37:28.538 --> 01:37:31.584
Well, I wanted to pick you up
when they released you.

01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:35.109
Appreciate it.

01:37:36.459 --> 01:37:38.026
Thanks for all your help, Bob.

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.506
Hey.

01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.440
You want a job
with the sheriff's department?

01:37:44.684 --> 01:37:46.077
What am I saying?

01:37:46.251 --> 01:37:48.950
The mess you left behind,
I must be crazy.

01:37:52.736 --> 01:37:53.816
Just let me think about it.

01:37:56.174 --> 01:37:57.436
Be well.

01:37:57.610 --> 01:37:58.611
You too.

01:38:42.177 --> 01:38:43.395
I'm so sorry.
