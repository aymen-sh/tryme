Hold on, Nio. Hajime is—

01:54.040 --> 01:55.090
Old man.

01:56.220 --> 01:57.590
Bamboo swords. Protectors.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.930

04:11.960 --> 04:13.120
Hijikata-san.

04:15.950 --> 04:18.760
Oh, I see. He beat me.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.970

You can't beat him.

04:32.830 --> 04:35.330
You don't need to try to catch up to him.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.500
Nio, I didn't choose you 
for your skill with a sword.

04:40.850 --> 04:45.380
I know. But that's why
 I need to work up a sweat.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.600
Huh?

04:46.600 --> 04:49.350
I've got to sweat up a storm!

04:49.670 --> 04:53.100
Well, I don't really get it, 
but you want to keep training, right?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.610
If you want to learn swordsmanship here,

04:56.610 --> 04:57.800
speak to him.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.120
Start here.

04:59.830 --> 05:00.600
End here.

05:00.880 --> 05:05.050
Whoa. Th-That was so fast.
It even sounded different.

05:05.380 --> 05:09.750
In my youth, I did this a
 thousand times every day.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.500
P-Please watch me try, sir.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.110
Very well.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.550
One! Two! Three! Four!

05:13.210 --> 05:15.920
<i>He's earnest. Motivated, too.</i>

05:17.040 --> 05:23.220
10! 11! 12! 13!

05:17.080 --> 05:18.130
<i>But...</i>

05:22.360 --> 05:23.440
<i>He has no talent.</i>

05:23.220 --> 05:28.140
14! 15! 16!

05:25.160 --> 05:26.070
Not like that.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.930
Listen, the trick is...

05:28.140 --> 05:29.430
17!

05:30.130 --> 05:32.760
18! 19!

05:33.360 --> 05:36.280
20! 21!

05:37.030 --> 05:40.270
22! 23!

05:41.040 --> 05:46.360
24! 25! 26!

05:41.110 --> 05:42.520
<i>I'm hopeless.</i>

05:43.600 --> 05:48.470
<i>So, as a newcomer, 
I'll let my actions speak for me.</i>

05:46.950 --> 05:50.280
27! 28!

05:49.670 --> 05:52.910
<i>If I want to stay, I'll have to show it.</i>

05:50.860 --> 05:52.480

05:53.330 --> 05:56.530
30! 31!

05:57.070 --> 06:00.050
<i>If I can't measure up, 
I'll at least work up a sweat.</i>

05:57.400 --> 06:00.760
32! 33!

06:00.790 --> 06:04.210
<i>I'll keep plugging away 
at the things anyone can do.</i>

06:01.560 --> 06:05.130
34! 35!

06:05.490 --> 06:09.090
36! 37!

06:16.860 --> 06:19.560
Hold up. Is he <i>still</i> going at it?

06:19.690 --> 06:22.320
He's hopeless. A real slow learner.

06:23.140 --> 06:25.160
Well, he is a kid.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.490
And he hasn't got the knack.

06:28.070 --> 06:31.570
Can you blame him? He only just started.

06:36.000 --> 06:36.930
Out with it.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.590
What's the matter, Nagakura-san?

06:40.170 --> 06:41.920
Where's the harm?

06:47.270 --> 06:48.880
895!

06:49.820 --> 06:56.730
896! 897! 898!

06:57.090 --> 07:00.320
That's the spirit! Keep it up! Almost there!

06:57.680 --> 07:05.250
899! 900! 901!

07:02.640 --> 07:07.060
We are all swordsmen 
who fell behind the times.

07:06.110 --> 07:09.240
902! 903!

07:09.420 --> 07:13.350
Who belongs in the Miburo 
more than a bungler?

07:15.930 --> 07:16.940
True.

07:17.490 --> 07:18.710
Well said.

07:18.920 --> 07:19.830
Right?

07:23.940 --> 07:25.600
I won't accept him.

07:26.090 --> 07:27.640
Yeah!

07:27.640 --> 07:29.110
Hang in there, Nio!

07:29.110 --> 07:30.600
One more swing!

07:32.560 --> 07:33.590
Damn it!

07:36.520 --> 07:39.760
<i>Nio, did I misjudge you?</i>

07:41.420 --> 07:43.810
<i>Are you a fast learner?</i>

07:44.310 --> 07:46.800
<i>Or did you always have it
 in you, lying dormant?</i>

07:47.110 --> 07:49.260
He's still in the ring!

07:49.260 --> 07:51.050
<i>This talent for sumo!</i>

07:53.620 --> 07:55.830
It's a tie!

07:54.750 --> 07:55.820
Again?

07:56.150 --> 07:58.270
In sumo, they're equals!

08:05.710 --> 08:07.090
The hell are you looking at?

08:07.290 --> 08:09.750
You're left-handed, huh, Hajime-kun?

08:11.240 --> 08:12.500
Don't talk to me!

08:13.100 --> 08:15.930
Oh, a fight? Have at it!

08:14.760 --> 08:17.920
Don't get a big head 
just 'cause we tied at sumo!

08:15.930 --> 08:17.140
What good friends.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.020
Let go!

08:24.240 --> 08:26.400
Rejoice. I bring good news.

08:27.190 --> 08:29.480
Our petition has been heard.

08:29.750 --> 08:33.080
I'm off to meet with officials from Aizu.

08:33.430 --> 08:36.030
Our money troubles are over,

08:36.030 --> 08:38.780
and the rest will sort itself out.

08:38.990 --> 08:43.280
What? That's amazing. You mean 
they're actually going to pay us?

08:43.280 --> 08:47.040
Yes. They even provided formalwear.

08:47.040 --> 08:51.300
Sir Kondo, Sir Hijikata, join us.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.600
<i>Something's fishy.</i>

08:59.450 --> 09:00.800
<i>He's actually going?</i>

09:01.610 --> 09:03.900
Count me out. I'm not interested.

09:06.190 --> 09:07.570
Do what you like.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.610
Nio. Hajime. We're going on patrol.

09:13.610 --> 09:15.690
Yes, sir. Right behind you.

09:19.310 --> 09:21.880
Oh, sorry. I forgot my wooden sword.

09:22.410 --> 09:23.320
I'll go grab it.

09:30.170 --> 09:33.090
Hijikata, why'd you 
recruit a guy like him?

09:34.840 --> 09:37.350
Miburo are supposed to be tough.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.640
We don't need wimps.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.760
He's a match for you in sumo.

09:43.760 --> 09:46.050
Sumo's got nothing to do with this!

09:46.340 --> 09:47.460
Found it!

09:48.670 --> 09:52.160
Hajime, spend some time with him
and you'll understand.

09:55.750 --> 09:56.930
I sure hope so.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.440
Huh?

10:06.760 --> 10:07.660
Um...

10:08.240 --> 10:10.720
Are you sure you shouldn't 
have gone, Hijikata-san?

10:11.190 --> 10:13.920
It was your big chance 
to meet officials from Aizu.

10:14.590 --> 10:19.750
I'm sure. We came here to 
keep Kyoto safe, and that's all.

10:20.610 --> 10:23.640
Who we serve doesn't change that.

10:23.960 --> 10:27.390
But this all costs money, doesn't it?

10:28.120 --> 10:32.390
And hosting us must 
put a strain on the Yagi family.

10:32.390 --> 10:33.030
Nio.

10:33.630 --> 10:34.400
Yes, sir?

10:35.640 --> 10:38.380
We guard this city with our lives.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.650
Yes, sir.

10:40.530 --> 10:44.400
I'd say we've earned three 
square meals and a place to sleep.

10:44.880 --> 10:45.990
<i>He's so cool!</i>

10:52.960 --> 10:56.240
<i>Hajime-kun's swords look awfully old.</i>

10:59.110 --> 11:00.610
<i>Are they antiques?</i>

11:05.410 --> 11:06.930
Don't stand on my left.

11:07.480 --> 11:08.070
Huh?

11:09.240 --> 11:10.760
Every samurai knows that.

11:11.070 --> 11:14.270
Oh, right. I-I understand.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.140
I have some business to take care of.
 Wait here for a bit.

11:22.140 --> 11:22.770
Yes, sir.

11:26.030 --> 11:31.820
355, 356, 357.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.830
Your median line is off-center.

11:34.940 --> 11:38.420
M-My what line? Uh, what do you mean?

11:41.520 --> 11:47.000
I, um, heard Kondo-san 
recruited you in Kyoto.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.650
How do you know him?

11:51.480 --> 11:54.730
<i>No answer? I see how it is.</i>

11:55.200 --> 11:59.070
Listen, you're technically 
my ally, so I'll warn you.

12:00.340 --> 12:01.930
I practice iai.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.070
<i>Iai!</i>

12:03.420 --> 12:06.070
Wh-What's "iai"?

12:08.250 --> 12:10.740
I don't know anything about swordsmanship.

12:11.730 --> 12:12.580
Stand back.

12:25.390 --> 12:26.640
That's iai.

12:27.210 --> 12:28.840
Once I get in range, I kill.

12:29.190 --> 12:31.500
W-Wow.

12:32.090 --> 12:33.700
Don't get the wrong idea.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.860
I'm saying, stay out of my range
 if you want to live.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.610
That was awesome!

12:39.820 --> 12:40.300
Huh?

12:41.020 --> 12:43.830
Maybe I'll try it once I finish 
my thousand practice swings.

12:44.270 --> 12:45.500
Like this!

12:46.140 --> 12:46.910
Or maybe this?

12:46.910 --> 12:49.240
Quit it. You'll hurt someone.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.400
What is it?

12:51.400 --> 12:52.760
Another attack?

12:52.760 --> 12:54.760
Nowhere's safe lately.

12:55.010 --> 12:55.710
Let's go see.

12:55.710 --> 12:56.900
H-Hey!

12:57.520 --> 12:59.800
Excuse me. Coming through.

13:01.500 --> 13:09.390
It hurts! It hurts!

13:11.270 --> 13:12.650
Who's this guy?

13:15.290 --> 13:16.500
That's enough.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.390
Stop!

13:17.390 --> 13:18.480
What're you doing?

13:22.670 --> 13:25.240
Stop! Stop it!

13:25.420 --> 13:28.230
<i>A child hostage? How could he?!</i>

13:26.670 --> 13:27.760
It hurts!

13:29.240 --> 13:33.000
It's war, war, war.

13:32.210 --> 13:33.770
Stop it!

13:33.480 --> 13:35.600
<i>We'd better not risk provoking him.</i>

13:36.320 --> 13:37.760
Let that girl go!

13:40.430 --> 13:42.420
<i>This guy!</i>

13:43.170 --> 13:45.010
Huh?

13:47.720 --> 13:49.940
You kids stay back. It's not safe.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.680
Funazo! Calm down!

13:52.160 --> 13:54.280
<i>"Funazo"? He knows him?</i>

13:55.080 --> 13:58.440
Violence won't bring Ofune-san back to life!

13:58.440 --> 13:59.430
That's right.

13:59.660 --> 14:02.610
Do you think she'd be happy 
seeing you like this—

14:03.440 --> 14:07.530
Stop! Stop it, Dad! I'm scared!

14:07.530 --> 14:09.930
Ah, Misaki.

14:11.140 --> 14:12.950
<i>He's her father?</i>

14:14.040 --> 14:15.880
Misaki!

14:16.380 --> 14:19.620
I'll avenge your mom! Avenge her!

14:20.100 --> 14:23.300
Avenge her? Ofune-san died of an illness.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.120
Excuse me?

14:26.890 --> 14:31.050
It's the times that did this to us!

14:31.880 --> 14:33.300
You all know what I mean!

14:34.080 --> 14:38.040
Ten years ago, the Black Ships came 
and the Shogun opened the port.

14:38.350 --> 14:45.320
But the unequal treaty he signed 
just bleeds our money away overseas!

14:45.640 --> 14:47.660
And who pays the cost?

14:48.850 --> 14:50.570
We do!

14:50.940 --> 14:54.460
Rice prices rise, 
and we can't afford medicine!

14:54.840 --> 14:55.870
Who's to blame?

14:56.600 --> 15:01.890
The bungling shogunate? 
The impotent emperor? Foreign invaders?

15:02.830 --> 15:05.360
Hey, you there. Brat!

15:05.680 --> 15:07.520
Do you know how things got this way?

15:08.220 --> 15:11.220
Do you know our enemy's name?!

15:12.140 --> 15:14.450
<i>Our enemy's... name?</i>

15:15.480 --> 15:17.220
Answer me!

15:17.220 --> 15:18.110
Shut up.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.260
It doesn't matter who's to blame.

15:24.180 --> 15:27.740
Stop whining already. 
You're only making yourself more pathetic.

15:28.990 --> 15:31.980
Shut up! What would <i>you</i> know?!

15:31.980 --> 15:33.330
It hurts!

15:33.330 --> 15:35.230
I've got to cut them down.

15:35.230 --> 15:36.040
Funazo—

15:36.480 --> 15:37.740
Get away!

15:39.380 --> 15:41.360
We need to go after him! 
That girl's in danger!

15:42.760 --> 15:43.940
Don't follow me!

15:46.170 --> 15:47.200
Damn it!

15:47.440 --> 15:48.730
Down there! An opening!

15:52.380 --> 15:54.400
He can't have gone far. Get looking.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.920
Hajime-kun, I need a favor!

15:58.920 --> 16:00.840
Huh? Save it for later!

16:01.150 --> 16:04.480
Could you please settle this 
without killing him?

16:04.780 --> 16:06.760
What? Are you crazy?

16:06.760 --> 16:08.440
That guy's better off dead!

16:08.870 --> 16:12.690
A wimp who blames anyone but himself
 will never learn his lesson!

16:12.960 --> 16:15.880
But he hasn't hurt or killed anyone yet.

16:16.310 --> 16:18.920
He can turn himself around.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.710
Once he kills, it'll be too late.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.010
I know that...

16:24.640 --> 16:26.940
but he's still that girl's father.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.880
I don't know what having a father is like,

16:31.680 --> 16:34.010
but I'm sure it's better than not having one.

16:35.710 --> 16:37.880
Fine. I'll do what I can.

16:38.230 --> 16:39.560
Happy now?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.970
Yes. Thank you.

16:42.280 --> 16:45.480
I'll finish this in one strike. 
You save the kid.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.540
Okay. Leave it to me.

16:49.160 --> 16:52.610
It hurts! It hurts!

16:52.610 --> 16:53.300
There.

16:53.980 --> 16:54.940
What's the plan?

16:56.720 --> 16:59.950
First stop, the palace. 
I'll go to the palace and...

17:00.330 --> 17:01.390
We run straight at him.

17:01.390 --> 17:02.200
Got it.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.130
He's spotted us.

17:06.130 --> 17:06.960
Go!

17:07.490 --> 17:08.960
Y-You!

17:09.480 --> 17:10.560
Hey, this looks bad.

17:11.270 --> 17:13.720
Hajime-kun, can you do your iai while running?

17:13.980 --> 17:16.100
Huh? No way in hell!

17:16.100 --> 17:17.600
Okay. Thanks.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.550
I just told you I can't do it!

17:19.740 --> 17:22.020
S-S-Stay back!

17:40.880 --> 17:41.740
Where's the kid?

17:46.270 --> 17:47.590
She's fine!

17:48.020 --> 17:49.260
Awe—

17:49.260 --> 17:52.330
All right. Well, that wasn't terrible.

17:58.650 --> 18:01.480
Sh-She must be all right
if she can cry this much.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.360
I'll say.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.000
Damn it all!

18:04.910 --> 18:06.770
I can at least end it all.

18:07.530 --> 18:10.070
That'll show them how I've suffered.

18:13.310 --> 18:15.440
That broken sword won't do the job.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.140
I don't want to hear it!

18:22.520 --> 18:24.220
Wh-Why stop me?

18:25.280 --> 18:26.160
Don't do it.

18:27.470 --> 18:29.240
But why stop me?

18:32.920 --> 18:36.050
I... I don't know my enemy's name.

18:38.310 --> 18:42.520
I don't know what I should 
be fighting against, but...

18:43.080 --> 18:44.090
Dad...

18:45.620 --> 18:48.320
Don't. Don't do it.

18:49.940 --> 18:52.190
I know you have a daughter.

18:55.270 --> 18:56.480
Funazo!

18:56.820 --> 18:59.970
And I know you have people
 who care about you.

19:01.720 --> 19:02.730
I'm sorry.

19:03.580 --> 19:06.740
I don't have the right answer,

19:10.230 --> 19:14.040
but Funazo-san, 
I know dying is the wrong one.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.750
I'm sure of that, if nothing else.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.660
That's what I think.

19:24.950 --> 19:26.000
Damn it.

19:27.530 --> 19:29.220
Damn it.

19:54.820 --> 19:55.770
Softies.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.570
They should've tossed him in a jail cell.

19:58.960 --> 19:59.950
Maybe.

20:00.730 --> 20:05.430
But it's better to fix things 
the soft way if you can.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.040
Oh! W-We might be in trouble!

20:11.040 --> 20:12.640
Why? What's wrong?

20:12.790 --> 20:16.930
Hijikata-san told us to 
stay put and wait for him.

20:25.840 --> 20:29.160
I hear you shrimps outdid yourselves.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.810
Thank you, sir.

20:30.810 --> 20:32.790
I'm not a shrimp!

20:34.170 --> 20:35.070
Cheeky brat.

20:35.070 --> 20:36.410
Jackass!

20:35.550 --> 20:37.170
P-Please stop.

20:38.560 --> 20:39.580
That's the spirit!

20:41.360 --> 20:45.200
This will help the boys grow. 
All according to plan.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.150
Seriously?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.830
<i>Oh no! I've only done 700 today!</i>

20:53.210 --> 20:54.120
Wrong.

20:55.660 --> 20:56.770
Hajime-kun?

20:57.520 --> 20:59.020
Your median line's off-center.

20:59.960 --> 21:03.260
You said that earlier. What does it mean?

21:03.770 --> 21:06.320
There's a line through 
the center of your body.

21:06.840 --> 21:11.000
It runs straight from your head to your toes.

21:13.260 --> 21:17.240
Always keep your left hand in line 
with it when you swing down.

21:20.110 --> 21:23.550
You'll get a little less awful 
if you can manage that.

21:25.990 --> 21:27.680
Thank you, Hajime-kun!

21:29.790 --> 21:32.800
Ugh! Look at these leftover onigiri!

21:33.800 --> 21:35.670
I-I couldn't tell he was there.

21:35.670 --> 21:36.690
Taro-kun?

21:38.070 --> 21:40.510
Won't someone eat them for me?

21:44.950 --> 21:49.950
<b>The
Name</b>

21:44.950 --> 21:49.950
<b>of the
Enemy</b>

23:20.040 --> 23:25.460
<b>Next time</b>

23:20.920 --> 23:28.330
Vicious killers stalk the streets as the 
storm of "sonno joi" rages through Kyoto.

23:28.760 --> 23:36.640
Hoping to pit outlaw against outlaw,
Aizu domain makes the Mibu Roshigumi an offer.

23:37.220 --> 23:44.010
The time has come for the Miburo 
to go forth, prepared to do or die.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.560
Next time: "United in Purpose."

23:47.110 --> 23:49.940
<b>United</b>

23:47.110 --> 23:49.940
<b>in
Purpose</b>

23:47.800 --> 23:49.080
It will not disappoint.
