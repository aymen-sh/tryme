With you there, the striker functions better.</b>

02:14.300 --> 02:18.940
<b>But Coach, I want to be

02:19.560 --> 02:21.160
<b>Not just get assists.</b>

<b>Can I have a role where I score the goals?</b>

<b>Where I get to play the style

<b>Soccer's a sport where you win as a team.</b>

<b><i>All adults...</i></b>

<b><i>They don't allow the flowers

<b><i>And soon you notice that
all the flowers are identical.</i></b>

<b><i>Nice assist!</i></b>

<b><i>We're invincible with you around!</i></b>

<b><i>We're the best team ever!</i></b>

03:26.880 --> 03:28.550
<b><i>Soon I noticed...</i></b>

03:30.200 --> 03:32.300
<b><i>I'd also forgotten how to bloom.</i></b>

03:36.510 --> 03:41.740
<b>Coach, I'm not finding 
soccer much fun lately.</b>

03:41.970 --> 03:46.500
<b>Come on now. Going pro 
isn't just a pipe dream for you.</b>

<b>Going pro, huh?</b>

03:50.770 --> 03:57.550
<b>Make decent money, marry a cute girl,
 and become somewhat happy.</b>

03:59.140 --> 04:03.490

the best striker in the world?</b>

04:05.680 --> 04:07.140
<b>Of course.</b>

04:07.140 --> 04:08.960
<b>You have the potential.</b>

04:10.130 --> 04:12.180
<b>I don't think I can.</b>

04:13.330 --> 04:17.610
<b>Because I used to believe I could, 
and that part of me died before I knew it.</b>

<b><i>I don't want to blame the adults.</i></b>

04:23.080 --> 04:25.900

04:40.700 --> 04:44.930
<b>You know all of those boring strikers

<b>That trick won't work twice.</b>

05:41.770 --> 05:43.730
<b><i>The time to steal it isn't when he kicks it.</i></b>

05:45.490 --> 05:49.950

<b><i>I would have been with these guys,

<b><i>In that case...</i></b>

<b>There isn't a sliver of rationality in you.</b>

<b><i>is here!</i></b>

12:38.390 --> 12:41.200
<b>Man, that's a super tough spot.</b>

12:42.070 --> 12:45.570
<b><i>Only Nagi can control that
 long pass into the goal area.</i></b>

12:46.910 --> 12:50.040
<b><i>The enemy will need to be wary of that.</i></b>

12:50.740 --> 12:52.500
<b><i>The goal's behind me.</i></b>

12:52.870 --> 12:54.090
<b><i>How sneaky of you...</i></b>

12:55.250 --> 12:56.790
<b><i>striker.</i></b>

12:57.940 --> 13:00.540
<b><i>Strike the shadow of the 
mental tableau I created.</i></b>

13:02.330 --> 13:05.880
<b><i>Use your reflexes to react to my ego!</i></b>

13:06.240 --> 13:07.260
<b>Yes, boss.</b>

13:08.010 --> 13:09.880
<b><i>Here it comes! I'm in on goal!</i></b>

13:09.880 --> 13:11.560
<b><i>Just as I predicted!</i></b>

13:12.210 --> 13:14.390
<b><i>I've made it to where Aiku can't reach!</i></b>

13:15.330 --> 13:18.070
<b><i>Now all the pieces are in place—</i></b>

13:17.320 --> 13:18.060
<b>Surprising.</b>

13:20.230 --> 13:24.260
<b>So you were the heart of Blue Lock, No. 11.</b>

13:25.570 --> 13:28.160
<b>I like that brain you've got.</b>

13:28.870 --> 13:29.760
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

13:30.370 --> 13:31.800
<b><i>What?</i></b>

13:31.800 --> 13:33.220
<b><i>Itoshi Sae?</i></b>

13:33.220 --> 13:35.960
<b><i>You weren't in my calculation!</i></b>

13:36.950 --> 13:39.310
<b><i>You've been outside of 
my vision this whole time.</i></b>

13:39.310 --> 13:43.270
<b><i>And you came to cover the most 
dangerous spot by the shortest route.</i></b>

13:44.670 --> 13:45.760
<b><i>No, stop.</i></b>

13:46.070 --> 13:48.810
<b><i>The perfect move I managed to wring out...</i></b>

13:48.810 --> 13:50.600
<b><i>The culmination of my play style...</i></b>

13:50.870 --> 13:52.540
<b><i>It's all gone in a flash?</i></b>

13:57.060 --> 14:03.900
<b>A striker shoulders that responsibility 
and fights until the very last second.</b>

14:05.010 --> 14:05.820
<b><i>No.</i></b>

14:06.960 --> 14:07.610
<b><i>Not yet!</i></b>

14:10.180 --> 14:12.170
<b><i>The moment isn't over!</i></b>

14:12.050 --> 14:14.040
<b>Blue Lock XI</b>

14:12.050 --> 14:14.040
<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

14:14.800 --> 14:19.750
<b><i>Even if he's read it all, there's still 
the very last second in front of the goal.</i></b>

14:20.420 --> 14:21.460
<b><i>I can do this.</i></b>

14:21.820 --> 14:23.800
<b><i>If I can touch the ball first...</i></b>

14:24.880 --> 14:27.830
<b><i>If I reach out my leg, I can score.</i></b>

14:28.680 --> 14:29.660
<b><i>Reach it.</i></b>

14:30.030 --> 14:31.590
<b><i>Even the tip of my toe will do!</i></b>

14:34.460 --> 14:35.350
<b><i>My very...</i></b>

14:37.150 --> 14:38.770
<b><i>last step!</i></b>

14:43.760 --> 14:46.070
<b><i>Huh? Am I losing my balance?</i></b>

14:46.490 --> 14:48.530
<b>You got ahead of yourself, No. 11.</b>

14:48.860 --> 14:52.240
<b>If your axis is off, 
your direct shot is dead.</b>

14:53.810 --> 14:56.320
<b><i>He threw me off with such a light push?</i></b>

14:58.160 --> 14:59.920
<b><i>The goal's right in front of me.</i></b>

15:01.130 --> 15:04.560
<b><i>But in his presence, my weapon isn't...</i></b>

15:04.560 --> 15:05.710
<b>Isagi!</b>

15:06.020 --> 15:07.040
<b>Look at me!</b>

15:10.460 --> 15:11.430
<b><i>Rin.</i></b>

15:13.390 --> 15:18.730
<b><i>I see. Itoshi Sae wasn't the only one who
 predicted and believed in my perfect play...</i></b>

15:19.560 --> 15:21.440
<b><i>and kept running!</i></b>

15:24.400 --> 15:27.110
<b>You're too naïve, buddy duo.</b>

15:27.530 --> 15:31.070
<b>Don't assume you can beat me
 with this level of play.</b>

15:34.120 --> 15:36.830
<b><i>Reach it. Take a shot, Rin!</i></b>

15:37.210 --> 15:39.170
<b><i>You can take...</i></b>

15:40.130 --> 15:41.540
<b><i>the last step!</i></b>

15:49.640 --> 15:50.530
<b><i>What?</i></b>

15:50.530 --> 15:51.750
<b><i>You?</i></b>

15:51.750 --> 15:53.640
<b><i>Why are </i>you<i> here?</i></b>

15:53.640 --> 15:56.600
<b><i>Isn't that No. 11 the only one
 you want to devour?</i></b>

15:57.970 --> 16:00.060
<b><i>I'll feast on you, Isagi.</i></b>

16:00.320 --> 16:02.020
<b><i>Your light...</i></b>

16:02.430 --> 16:05.730
<b><i>is mine!</i></b>

16:17.580 --> 16:20.600
<b><i>Goal!</i></b>

16:24.000 --> 16:27.910
<b><i>Barou Shouei dives in 
for a super sliding shot!</i></b>

16:28.340 --> 16:29.710
<b><i>He's stolen the show!</i></b>

16:31.010 --> 16:33.040
<b><i>Blue Lock are level!</i></b>

16:33.040 --> 16:35.970
<b><i>What a goal! That was incredible!</i></b>

16:39.410 --> 16:39.930
<b>Barou!</b>

16:40.360 --> 16:44.060
<b>Holy crap! How did you score that?
 Like, damn, man!</b>

16:44.890 --> 16:46.480
<b>Get your hands off me.</b>

16:46.770 --> 16:48.890
<b>Doesn't make a difference "how."</b>

16:49.300 --> 16:52.960
<b>My number one priority is 
to hunt you down and devour you.</b>

16:52.960 --> 16:54.700
<b>From beginning to end.</b>

16:54.700 --> 16:59.500
<b>But you managed to disappear
 so completely. How'd you do that?</b>

16:59.500 --> 17:01.330
<b>I didn't disappear by choice.</b>

17:01.970 --> 17:03.910
<b>I was erased.</b>

17:04.720 --> 17:09.610
<b>My play style of being fixated on you 
was immediately neutralized by them.</b>

17:10.360 --> 17:16.550
<b>So I decided to hunt down the plays
you were creating as you kept evolving.</b>

17:16.550 --> 17:19.270
<b>Huh? But then, how'd you 
read something like—</b>

17:19.270 --> 17:23.150
<b>There is one person 
who <i>can</i> link up with you.</b>

17:23.150 --> 17:24.820
<b>Itoshi Rin.</b>

17:25.310 --> 17:29.020
<b>I knew he'd react to your evolution.</b>

17:29.620 --> 17:36.450
<b>So I waited for that last pass 
from you to Rin in the darkness.</b>

17:37.730 --> 17:42.270
<b>But if you were so fixated on me, 
how'd you visualize it?</b>

17:42.270 --> 17:44.600
<b>Rin's movement and positioning, I mean.</b>

17:44.600 --> 17:47.080
<b>Huh? What are you talking about, donkey?</b>

17:47.640 --> 17:52.500
<b>You and Rin are so in sync, 
you're practically two hearts beating as one.</b>

17:52.500 --> 17:53.170
<b>Huh?</b>

17:53.940 --> 17:55.620
<b>It's simple.</b>

17:56.070 --> 17:57.640
<b>In my eyes,</b>

17:57.640 --> 18:00.640
<b>Rin is also Isagi.</b>

18:02.260 --> 18:04.830
<b>That was a crazier explanation
 than I expected.</b>

18:04.830 --> 18:07.770
<b>So that's the view that awaits you
 at the end of an obsession.</b>

18:07.770 --> 18:11.490
<b>Hmph. As if the likes of you 
could possibly understand me.</b>

18:15.010 --> 18:17.830
<b>Removing your shirt is 
ungentlemanly conduct.</b>

18:17.830 --> 18:18.870
<b>Yellow card.</b>

18:20.390 --> 18:23.680
<b><i>Oh dear. Barou gets a yellow card.</i></b>

18:23.680 --> 18:25.080
<b><i>Well, he did strip.</i></b>

18:25.080 --> 18:27.980
<b>Yer impossible to understand, dumdum.</b>

18:27.980 --> 18:30.630
<b>Don't strip again, Stripper King.</b>

18:31.550 --> 18:35.200
<b><i>It's true that his goal just now 
was born out of Barou's obsession.</i></b>

18:35.200 --> 18:37.560
<b><i>A super goal only he could score.</i></b>

18:38.040 --> 18:41.090
<b><i>But that wasn't the only thing
 that made it possible.</i></b>

18:42.130 --> 18:43.800
<b><i>The move where I stole through.</i></b>

18:44.990 --> 18:47.060
<b><i>The pass to Rin, who'd responded to my play.</i></b>

18:47.990 --> 18:50.520
<b><i>And Barou nabbing it by playing the heel.</i></b>

18:52.250 --> 18:56.050
<b><i>No, Karasu and Nagi helped, too.</i></b>

18:56.760 --> 18:59.490
<b><i>Everyone involved in that play...</i></b>

19:00.950 --> 19:05.700
<b><i>With everyone rising to their own 
challenge, it became a trance chain.</i></b>

19:07.140 --> 19:08.680
<b><i>I see.</i></b>

19:08.680 --> 19:11.370
<b><i>Having faith in someone's 
trance and going with it.</i></b>

19:12.550 --> 19:16.920
<b><i>That's the final piece 
we need to defeat the U-20s.</i></b>

19:21.890 --> 19:24.440
<b><i>What do I do now? They've equalized.</i></b>

19:24.440 --> 19:26.280
<b><i>Should I send on some subs?</i></b>

19:26.280 --> 19:29.080
<b><i>But maybe a draw will save my neck?</i></b>

19:29.080 --> 19:29.890
<b><i>Glance.</i></b>

19:30.370 --> 19:32.020
<b>Goddamn!</b>

19:33.470 --> 19:35.170
<b>Yo, puppet manager.</b>

19:35.610 --> 19:37.240
<b>Got a plan?</b>

19:37.240 --> 19:40.300
<b>Oh, uh... First, we'll park the bus,</b>

19:40.300 --> 19:43.740
<b>then play to our strengths and 
bet it all on one last counterattack—</b>

19:43.740 --> 19:47.870
<b>A dumb plan without a hint of originality
 that any idiot could've come up with.</b>

19:49.890 --> 19:53.360
<b>That's your manager's assessment.
How dare a mere player question...</b>

19:53.900 --> 19:56.050
<b>They can still fight.</b>

19:57.540 --> 20:00.490
<b>Here's a message from a "mere player":</b>

20:00.490 --> 20:02.930
<b>Don't you dare do something
 boring like bring on subs.</b>

20:04.060 --> 20:10.310
<b>If you wanna call yourself a manager, 
feel the fire that's in this team right now.</b>

20:14.150 --> 20:15.740
<b>You frustrated, Sendou?</b>

20:17.120 --> 20:21.030
<b>Same here. They really are
 something, that Blue Lock.</b>

20:21.030 --> 20:24.410
<b>Damn it. We're still level.</b>

20:25.520 --> 20:29.320
<b>Yeah. The stronger his foe,</b>

20:29.320 --> 20:33.210
<b>the more fired-up the star player gets
 as he rails against the world.</b>

20:34.050 --> 20:36.460
<b>The star player of this team is you.</b>

20:36.970 --> 20:38.920
<b>You still have fire in you, right, Sendou?</b>

20:39.260 --> 20:41.300
<b>Yeah. That goes without saying.</b>

20:44.910 --> 20:47.530
<b><i>I'm never gonna play soccer
 for someone else again.</i></b>

20:48.340 --> 20:50.750
<b><i>I'll let my flower bloom for me.</i></b>

20:51.390 --> 20:53.550
<b><i>That's what I swore to myself before.</i></b>

20:54.390 --> 20:55.110
<b><i>But...</i></b>

20:56.000 --> 21:02.150
<b><i>If there's a true striker 
struggling to bloom in this country...</i></b>

21:03.170 --> 21:08.930
<b><i>I want to be someone who can offer 
my hand and tell that bud to bloom.</i></b>

21:10.390 --> 21:11.740
<b><i>But not yet.</i></b>

21:12.310 --> 21:16.300
<b><i>I'm the last wall to be conquered

21:17.620 --> 21:18.680
<b><i>Bloom.</i></b>

21:19.180 --> 21:21.920
<b><i>Surpass me, Blue Lock!</i></b>

22:54.210 --> 23:00.310
<b><i>The match is in its final phase. 
Can Japan's U-20s take the lead again?</i></b>

23:00.810 --> 23:03.360
<b>Yo, donkey. Shine some more.</b>

23:04.640 --> 23:10.490
<b>Let your energy burst. Then, I'll devour you
 and become the leading man in this match.</b>

23:11.500 --> 23:14.330
<b>Go ahead and try, Sidekick King.</b>

23:14.330 --> 23:17.290
<b>I'll score for us. One more goal.</b>

23:17.290 --> 23:19.000
<b>Let's go take the lead.</b>

23:19.000 --> 23:21.710

23:22.880 --> 23:24.330
<b><i>You shitheads...</i></b>

23:25.650 --> 23:27.920

23:28.840 --> 23:30.320
