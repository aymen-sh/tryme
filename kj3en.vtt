WEBVTT

00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.995
Fine. I'll move it myself.

00:00:03.663 --> 00:00:04.914
That suit...

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:10.461
MONSTER SWEEPER INC.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.054
Who are you?

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.057
I'm applicant number 2016.

00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:27.812
Kikoru Shinomiya.
My hobby is killing kaiju.

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:30.314
Remember my name, all right?

00:00:30.398 --> 00:00:32.650
Shinomiya!

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:38.614
Hey, old man. You smell like kaiju.

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:42.326
Our work is cleaning up neutralized kaiju.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.329
Why are cleaners like you
at a place like this?

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.417
All right, then.

00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:54.005
Does he have a private suit, too?

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:57.049
Applicant number 2032.

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:01.387
I'm Kafka Hibino.
Don't forget my name, little girl!

00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:07.852
They took our parking spot
while I was talking!

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:09.854
That's one capable butler!

00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:14.776
I just came here to participate
in the rite of passage,

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.111
but it looks like
I could enjoy my time here.

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:22.700
I can't wait to beat you, Kafka Hibino.

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:26.871
-Let's go, Sebasu.
-Yes, my lady.

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:39.383
You already used your powers.

00:01:40.384 --> 00:01:44.388
Hey, you know, I just transformed
the parts where you can't see.

00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:46.891
-That's not the problem here!
-Hey there!

00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:49.769
We heard a loud noise.
Is there trouble here?

00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:53.940
No, it's nothing. We're all right.

00:01:54.023 --> 00:01:56.567
-Go inside quickly then!
-Understood!

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.908
If you use your powers again,
I'll send you back.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.494
Okay.

00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:11.374
I gave up once,

00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:16.170
but this is my last chance
to stand next to her!

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.301
I'll never...

00:02:23.427 --> 00:02:25.304
give up this time!

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:35.815
ORIGINAL WORK BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

00:04:02.693 --> 00:04:04.612
{\an8}Shit. What's going on?

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:08.240
I can't keep up at all.

00:04:08.324 --> 00:04:11.410
I still keep up with my training
from old habits,

00:04:11.494 --> 00:04:14.288
and I work at my physically demanding
job every day.

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.626
The secondary exam has a physical
fitness test and an aptitude test.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.172
Yes. The aptitude test looks at our
natural qualities. We can't control that.

00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:25.925
-That means...
-Yeah.

00:04:26.008 --> 00:04:29.720
We'll need to score high
on the physical fitness test.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.645
I was at least
a little below average last time!

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.648
So, why...

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.700
Is this what they mean when they say
your body declines in your thirties?

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.372
If I use my powers,

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.875
Could I outrun all of them in an instant?

00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:02.795
Shit! My body is heavy.

00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:04.797
KAFKA HIBINO
PHYSICAL FITNESS TEST RANKING

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.050
219 OUT OF 225

00:05:08.134 --> 00:05:11.053
KIKORU SHINOMIYA
5 OUT OF 225

00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:16.183
Wow, that was fast. I beat you already.

00:05:17.852 --> 00:05:24.316
I'm Kafka Hibino. Don't forget my name,
little girl... girl... girl!

00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:27.486
Forget it!

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.197
Forget my name right this instant!

00:05:37.455 --> 00:05:41.000
I feel at ease. So, you really didn't use

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:43.002
your kaiju powers.

00:05:46.255 --> 00:05:48.591
Everyone worked hard to get here.

00:05:48.674 --> 00:05:52.386
It would be unfair
if I used my powers here.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.223
Look, I'm trying to act all cool,
but I should've used it!

00:05:56.307 --> 00:05:58.142
I'm so rusty!

00:05:58.225 --> 00:06:01.604
Your ranking might not just be
because you're rusty.

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:06.734
Here are the applicants this year.

00:06:06.817 --> 00:06:09.028
There are some interesting people.

00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:13.908
You probably only care
about beating kaiju, though.

00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:18.454
Continue updating me.
I'll listen as I work.

00:06:19.038 --> 00:06:20.581
Oh, wow, that's new.

00:06:21.332 --> 00:06:25.544
Let's see.
I guess our star player would be...

00:06:25.628 --> 00:06:27.254
Haruichi Izumo.

00:06:27.338 --> 00:06:29.423
Tokyo Neutralization University.

00:06:29.507 --> 00:06:30.800
Graduated at the top of class.

00:06:30.883 --> 00:06:34.804
{\an8}He's the top player
out of this year's graduates.

00:06:35.513 --> 00:06:37.848
Another hopeful is Iharu Furuhashi.

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:42.144
{\an8}Hachioji Neutralization Technical College,
graduated at the top of the class.

00:06:42.228 --> 00:06:43.562
{\an8}IHARU FURUHASHI
THIRD PLACE

00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:45.189
All right!

00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:47.233
The young hopeful of JGSDF,

00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:48.609
{\an8}Aoi Kaguragi.

00:06:48.692 --> 00:06:49.652
{\an8}AOI KAGURAGI
FIRST PLACE

00:06:49.735 --> 00:06:52.613
{\an8}He's a transfer applicant who declined
a promised future at JGSDF

00:06:52.696 --> 00:06:54.740
in order to join the Defense Force.

00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:56.659
That's not all.

00:06:56.742 --> 00:07:01.247
I see more neutralization universities
and technical college jackets than usual.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.332
These are elites who would usually go

00:07:03.415 --> 00:07:06.544
for management positions
rather than working on the field.

00:07:06.627 --> 00:07:09.797
No wonder they're all so advanced.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.925
And out of all of them, she's at the top.

00:07:14.593 --> 00:07:17.304
She was the youngest and top graduate

00:07:17.388 --> 00:07:20.349
of California Neutralization University
at the age of 16.

00:07:20.432 --> 00:07:23.227
She's considered to be the best talent
in all of history.

00:07:24.186 --> 00:07:25.688
She is Kikoru Shinomiya.

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:27.982
I'll crush her!

00:07:28.065 --> 00:07:31.986
How will my skills hold up to hers?

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.988
I'll be keeping an eye on her.

00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:39.910
Everyone here is extremely talented,
with Kikoru Shinomiya at the top.

00:07:39.994 --> 00:07:43.706
-That's why you...
-So, she's...

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:47.918
Hello there. You finally
realized how great I am?

00:07:48.002 --> 00:07:51.422
-Kafka Hibino...
-I didn't know you were that good!

00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:54.175
Don't lay a finger on our lady!

00:07:54.258 --> 00:07:56.802
What's up with that old guy?

00:07:56.886 --> 00:07:58.929
Maybe he's a fan of Shinomiya.

00:08:01.056 --> 00:08:04.852
That's the second time I saw you
lose today, Kafka Hibino.

00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:08.105
How many more times will I see
that pathetic face of yours?

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:15.988
I'll beat you for sure today!

00:08:20.618 --> 00:08:23.829
Except that I'm already on the edge
of being cut.

00:08:23.913 --> 00:08:25.497
We still have hope.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.668
For the upcoming aptitude test,
in the past two years,

00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:32.004
they've had applicants clean up
kaiju remains.

00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:33.589
What?

00:08:33.672 --> 00:08:37.593
They assess your level of kaiju knowledge
and teamwork

00:08:37.676 --> 00:08:42.556
while raising awareness that
neutralization isn't just defeating kaiju.

00:08:43.182 --> 00:08:46.560
This is why I decided to work in cleaning
for my part-time job.

00:08:46.644 --> 00:08:48.062
All right!

00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:51.065
-Let's hope the next one will go well!
-Yeah!

00:08:51.148 --> 00:08:52.399
{\an8}NUMBER TWO

00:08:52.483 --> 00:08:54.568
{\an8}DEFENSE FORCE
TRAINING AREA TWO

00:08:54.652 --> 00:08:56.570
So huge!

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:01.909
I'm the head of the selection committee
for the secondary exams

00:09:01.992 --> 00:09:04.411
and the vice-captain
of the Third Division, Hoshina.

00:09:04.495 --> 00:09:05.329
VICE-CAPTAIN OF THE THIRD DIVISION
SOSHIRO HOSHINA

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:08.874
The aptitude test will be held
in this training area.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.093
You all will be working
with a kaiju in this training area.

00:09:19.176 --> 00:09:20.594
Clean-up!

00:09:20.678 --> 00:09:22.554
You'll be neutralizing it.

00:09:26.725 --> 00:09:28.269
-Neutra...
-...lizing?

00:10:04.346 --> 00:10:08.267
I thought we're cleaning up here!
Huh, Ichikawa-san?

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.770
I'm talking about the previous two years!
I'm disappointed too!

00:10:11.854 --> 00:10:16.650
But we can't let you guys
go in there empty-handed.

00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:19.403
You'll be wearing these.

00:10:23.073 --> 00:10:25.701
This is by Izumo Tech.

00:10:25.784 --> 00:10:28.245
The G-X4552, huh?

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.499
What is this?

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:34.376
Amazing.

00:10:35.044 --> 00:10:37.671
It's like the clothes are sticking
to my body.

00:10:37.755 --> 00:10:41.258
Physical evaluation
and form assimilation complete.

00:10:41.342 --> 00:10:44.345
Kaiju muscle fibers, fully operational.

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:49.892
I can feel the suit merging with my body.

00:10:49.975 --> 00:10:53.562
I can feel my muscles expanding.
It's so hot.

00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:55.689
So, this is...

00:10:56.357 --> 00:10:59.193
These are the Defense Force's
Kaiju Countermeasure Suits.

00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:01.862
It's made
from the biological tissue of kaiju

00:11:01.945 --> 00:11:05.532
and greatly raises the fighting ability
of the wearer.

00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:10.913
This is the best weapon to fight
against kaiju for you guys that we have.

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:14.750
I'll be measuring the unleashed combat
power for everyone who put on the suit.

00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:16.376
Roger that!

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.128
Reno Ichikawa.

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:20.547
Unleashed combat power, 8%.

00:11:21.465 --> 00:11:24.301
Haruichi Izumo, 18%.

00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:26.428
That's around what I expected.

00:11:26.512 --> 00:11:29.807
-Aoi Kaguragi, 15%.
-Yes, sir.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.811
-Iharu Furuhashi, 14%.
-What?

00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:38.440
Unleashed combat power measures how much
of the suit's power is being released.

00:11:38.524 --> 00:11:41.568
If you've had a lot of training,
you'd be around 20%.

00:11:41.652 --> 00:11:46.031
You'd usually be lucky if you see
one applicant over 10%.

00:11:46.115 --> 00:11:50.869
We might really have the best pool
of applicants in our history.

00:11:52.037 --> 00:11:53.413
-Seriously?
-The rumors are true.

00:11:53.497 --> 00:11:55.332
Kikoru Shinomiya.

00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:58.919
{\an8}Unleashed combat power is 46%!

00:12:03.924 --> 00:12:07.845
Are you kidding me?
She's already at Platoon Leader level!

00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:10.556
The best talent in history.

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:13.517
This might be the highest record
for any applicant!

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:15.769
I'm only at 8%.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.148
Don't be so down, Ichikawa-kun.

00:12:19.731 --> 00:12:22.359
Well, 8% is great for a first-timer.

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:25.863
Honestly, as long as you're not at zero
right now, you've passed.

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:29.408
Though I've never seen anyone
at zero in my time here!

00:12:29.491 --> 00:12:30.868
Kafka Hibino.

00:12:31.535 --> 00:12:34.413
{\an8}Unleashed combat power, 0%!

00:12:37.499 --> 00:12:40.043
What's with that guy?
We have our first zero!

00:12:40.127 --> 00:12:42.713
Maybe it's a measurement error.

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:45.257
Give me a bit more time!

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.092
I'm pushing right now!

00:12:49.178 --> 00:12:52.055
Is he taking a shit?
Pushing won't do anything!

00:12:53.515 --> 00:12:57.811
That old guy is hilarious!
I like that dude.

00:12:57.895 --> 00:12:59.563
He probably won't pass, though.

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:01.565
Please focus on the selection process.

00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:03.483
Why?

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:07.321
Shit. I'm sure there's a trick to this.

00:13:07.404 --> 00:13:09.781
I just have to figure it out
before the exam ends.

00:13:10.574 --> 00:13:13.660
Kafka Hibino, don't make me impatient.

00:13:13.744 --> 00:13:17.372
Show off the power you released
in the parking lot!

00:13:17.456 --> 00:13:19.166
The exam's about to end.

00:13:22.127 --> 00:13:26.548
All right, everyone has their suits on?

00:13:27.591 --> 00:13:29.301
Let's begin...

00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:31.220
the final test.

00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:38.018
{\an8}DEFENSE FORCE SELECTION EXAM
FINAL ROUND

00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:39.937
Here's what will happen in this test.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.025
The target is one honju that was placed
in this large training area

00:13:45.108 --> 00:13:47.903
designed like an urban district
and 36 yoju.

00:13:47.986 --> 00:13:51.782
We neutralized a kaiju that produced
16 victims in Hachioji last year

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:54.743
and captured it live
to train our newcomers.

00:13:54.826 --> 00:13:59.289
You'll be in combat
using kaiju fighting weapons.

00:14:00.165 --> 00:14:02.751
Each applicant will be monitored
by being followed

00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:04.753
by an automatic tracking drone.

00:14:05.462 --> 00:14:08.548
If we judge that your life is at risk,

00:14:08.632 --> 00:14:11.718
we'll release the suit shield remotely.

00:14:11.802 --> 00:14:15.347
But understand that this means
you will be disqualified from that point.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.687
Honestly, from this point forward,
we can't guarantee that you'll survive.

00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:25.691
Those who still have the will to continue...

00:14:25.774 --> 00:14:27.442
proceed!

00:14:34.116 --> 00:14:35.826
What the hell is that?

00:14:45.961 --> 00:14:47.671
Yoju 12 has been eviscerated.

00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:52.426
Yoju 3 has been eviscerated.

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:54.011
Damn.

00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:56.263
-Wow.
-Amazing.

00:14:56.346 --> 00:15:00.601
Dammit, we're going, too!
Follow me, Ichikawa!

00:15:00.684 --> 00:15:02.686
You're the one behind me!

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:06.523
These weapons are so heavy
without any power from the suit.

00:15:06.607 --> 00:15:10.861
-Only a zero percenter could understand...
-That's not a cool line!

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:13.113
But what should we do?

00:15:13.196 --> 00:15:15.741
We don't have much attacking power.

00:15:15.824 --> 00:15:18.827
Oh, right, I forgot to mention.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.789
We're joined by Captain Mina Ashiro
for our aptitude test selection.

00:15:22.873 --> 00:15:25.375
Go ahead and show off what you've got!

00:15:26.835 --> 00:15:30.255
Let's bet on who becomes
the coolest Defense Force officer!

00:15:30.881 --> 00:15:34.551
That's right. Who cares if I'm at zero?

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:39.848
Calm down.
This is my last and final chance.

00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:42.017
Ichikawa.

00:15:42.893 --> 00:15:47.689
Why did the judges assign a drone
to follow each one of us?

00:15:49.274 --> 00:15:52.944
You're right. If they only care about
how many kaiju we neutralize,

00:15:53.028 --> 00:15:55.656
they can just use a sensor
to count the numbers.

00:15:56.448 --> 00:16:02.204
Right. They're looking at how we act
based on our skills and situation.

00:16:02.913 --> 00:16:07.167
In that case, what we should do
as someone with low attacking power is...

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.377
Exactly.

00:16:10.796 --> 00:16:13.674
-We'll support the attackers!
-Yes!

00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:19.096
Shit!

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:21.556
Senpai! They're fighting to your right.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.017
All right. Let's go around
and support them.

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:37.531
The shape of that hoof...

00:16:38.407 --> 00:16:43.328
I remember! This is the yoju we cleaned
in collaboration with Iida Cleaners.

00:16:43.412 --> 00:16:45.038
I see.

00:16:45.122 --> 00:16:49.084
That's why they added this
to our collection of weapons.

00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:53.380
Take this!

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.016
A stun grenade?

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.062
This guy has developed hearing to make up
for his deteriorating eyesight.

00:17:09.146 --> 00:17:12.566
So, we'll throw that off balance
and find a target!

00:17:12.649 --> 00:17:13.984
-It's the belly!
-Huh?

00:17:14.484 --> 00:17:17.529
The skin on his belly is thinner
than the rest of his body.

00:17:18.113 --> 00:17:20.574
-Aim for the belly!
-What?

00:17:34.337 --> 00:17:37.007
Nice assist. Shinomiya fan!

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.301
I'm not her fan!

00:17:48.351 --> 00:17:50.979
-Nice job, Senpai!
-Thanks.

00:17:51.062 --> 00:17:54.399
I haven't cleaned up
all those kaiju for nothing.

00:17:54.483 --> 00:17:58.153
I know all about you, inside and out!

00:17:58.904 --> 00:18:02.407
I can do it without using my kaiju powers!

00:18:03.033 --> 00:18:06.161
I'll compensate for all the mishaps
up to this point!

00:18:06.745 --> 00:18:09.664
I'll throw the next one!
Let's just keep going.

00:18:20.675 --> 00:18:22.344
Another kaiju?

00:18:26.807 --> 00:18:27.682
Senpai!

00:18:28.433 --> 00:18:31.019
Area Delta, number 2032 has been injured.

00:18:31.102 --> 00:18:34.272
Vitals are abnormal. He's unable to fight.

00:18:34.356 --> 00:18:37.275
Yoju 23 is continuing to attack!

00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:39.277
Prepare the remote shield.

00:18:42.364 --> 00:18:44.866
Ouch...

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.286
Shit. They're releasing the remote shield.

00:18:49.329 --> 00:18:51.915
Understand that this means
you will be disqualified.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.796
Stand up. She's...

00:18:58.797 --> 00:19:01.299
She's watching me.

00:19:01.383 --> 00:19:06.555
I can't be acting more pathetic
than I already am!

00:19:06.638 --> 00:19:08.557
Releasing the Remote Shield!

00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:12.394
So, he's the first one out, huh? Figures.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.855
He was a funny dude,

00:19:15.564 --> 00:19:17.023
but it can't be helped.

00:19:28.785 --> 00:19:32.455
That's your third losing face,
Kafka Hibino.

00:19:33.748 --> 00:19:38.295
I won't allow any victims
where I'm fighting.

00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:40.255
Kikoru! You saved me...

00:19:40.338 --> 00:19:43.717
I'll take care of this gracefully.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.469
You just lie there pathetically, okay?

00:19:50.682 --> 00:19:53.351
-She's going for the main target!
-That's mine!

00:19:57.105 --> 00:19:59.024
Don't be so distracted!

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:04.029
So powerful. Is it really
the same weapon as mine?

00:20:04.112 --> 00:20:07.824
Unleashed combat power makes
a huge difference in our attacking force.

00:20:07.908 --> 00:20:11.036
I'm going too!

00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:12.078
Senpai!

00:20:13.121 --> 00:20:16.708
It's broken? I can't stand up anymore.

00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:19.628
Can you hear me, number 2032?

00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:21.463
It's Hoshina, from the operation room.

00:20:22.839 --> 00:20:25.383
Your vitals are abnormal.

00:20:25.467 --> 00:20:28.261
Broken bones in various places.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.015
There may be damages
to your internal organs.

00:20:32.807 --> 00:20:34.809
No way.

00:20:36.478 --> 00:20:38.396
I have to give up?

00:20:39.147 --> 00:20:42.484
But if I still have a chance, I'll...

00:20:48.073 --> 00:20:50.492
‪2032
‪KAFKA HIBINO

{\an8}UNLEASHED COMBAT POWER: 0%

00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:56.998
There's no way I could stand next to her.

00:20:57.916 --> 00:20:59.292
There's no way.

00:21:04.089 --> 00:21:06.841
It's always the talented ones who pass.

00:21:12.055 --> 00:21:15.475
As judges, we recommend that you retire.

00:21:15.558 --> 00:21:18.603
The shield won't protect you
from everything.

00:21:21.898 --> 00:21:24.526
I'm the only one that can decide

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.611
whether to give up.

00:21:27.404 --> 00:21:28.947
Senpai.

00:21:29.864 --> 00:21:33.201
I'm at no age to have dreams.

00:21:38.999 --> 00:21:42.711
I know it's lame.

00:21:44.254 --> 00:21:48.049
But I decided to bet
on my entire life so far

00:21:49.342 --> 00:21:52.303
{\an8}to chase after this one thing.
