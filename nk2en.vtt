<b>The secrets of our ninja arts
must never leave this clan.</b>

00:08.000 --> 00:11.050
<b>Under no circumstances
will they be shared with outsiders.</b>

00:11.130 --> 00:14.130
<b>Bear in mind: your mission is your life.</b>

00:15.050 --> 00:18.640
<b>We dedicate everything to maintain peace
in the land of the rising sun.</b>

00:20.350 --> 00:22.390
<b>A terrorist attack on this scale
is unprecedented.</b>

00:22.480 --> 00:25.520
<b>It has rocked the very foundations
of the world and...</b>

00:26.230 --> 00:27.520
<b>Starting today,</b>

00:27.610 --> 00:30.530
<b>our organization shall leave
the jurisdiction of Japan</b>

00:30.610 --> 00:33.650
<b>and fall under the command
of a greater power.</b>

00:34.030 --> 00:39.240
<b>Therefore, the secrets of our ninja arts
may now be shared with foreigners.</b>

00:41.950 --> 00:43.460
<b>Make no mistake.</b>

00:44.250 --> 00:47.080
<b>This, too, we do for Japan's future.</b>

00:50.050 --> 00:54.090
<b>Any who disobey this decision,
or defect because of it,</b>

00:54.170 --> 00:56.760
<b>shall be branded "exiles" and disposed of.</b>

01:03.770 --> 01:04.890
<b>Higan...</b>

01:14.360 --> 01:15.740
<b>Daddy!</b>

01:35.090 --> 01:36.630
<b>Aw, jeez.</b>

01:36.720 --> 01:39.590
<b>This is quite a mess
you've gotten yourself into, Higan.</b>

01:40.720 --> 01:43.390
<b>Why are... you here?</b>

01:44.520 --> 01:47.060
<b>Well, these guys just
wouldn't keep it down.</b>

01:47.940 --> 01:50.060
<b>I honestly didn't think
we'd ever meet again...</b>

01:50.650 --> 01:53.070
<b>until the afterlife.</b>

03:26.530 --> 03:28.660
<b>It's a shame about Mari.</b>

03:30.910 --> 03:33.170
<b>Why don't you have your disguise on?</b>

03:33.250 --> 03:35.670
<b>Because the organization somehow
found a way to see through</b>

03:35.750 --> 03:37.130
<b>the masking system we've been using.</b>

03:37.210 --> 03:38.550
<b>Impossible.</b>

03:38.920 --> 03:41.840
<b>Please remove it. It's useless now.</b>

03:42.130 --> 03:46.810
<b>I swear, you're always beat to hell
whenever I see you.</b>

03:46.890 --> 03:48.850
<b>Obviously.</b>

03:48.930 --> 03:50.600
<b>You're a doctor, aren't you?</b>

03:52.100 --> 03:55.190
<b>You used the
Secret Art of Stark Awareness, eh?</b>

04:00.440 --> 04:02.450
<b>Never do it again.</b>

04:02.530 --> 04:04.070
<b>It will kill you next time.</b>

04:05.530 --> 04:07.780
<b>Wait, this doesn't make any sense!</b>

04:07.870 --> 04:09.790
<b>Forget the next time...</b>

04:10.120 --> 04:13.330
<b>you should have been
dead from this wound already!</b>

04:13.920 --> 04:15.130
<b>Yeah...</b>

04:15.210 --> 04:17.960
<b>I don't understand
why I was the one who lived.</b>

04:18.040 --> 04:20.460
<b>It could have been dumb luck.</b>

04:20.550 --> 04:23.880
<b>Or perhaps someone is keeping you alive.</b>

04:28.720 --> 04:30.140
<b>Let's get started.</b>

04:30.220 --> 04:35.190
<b>It will take five or six days before even
someone like you can make a full recovery.</b>

04:35.690 --> 04:38.940
<b>I just need to be able to move,
then I get answers from our guest.</b>

04:39.730 --> 04:41.030
<b>What comes after that?</b>

04:41.110 --> 04:42.610
<b>I'll go invade their base.</b>

04:42.690 --> 04:43.860
<b>By yourself?</b>

04:43.950 --> 04:46.160
<b>Why, are you volunteering to help?</b>

04:48.160 --> 04:49.870
<b>This shouldn't hurt.</b>

04:52.950 --> 04:54.750
<b>After it goes in, of course.</b>

05:40.210 --> 05:42.250
<b>You friggin' bastard!</b>

05:42.590 --> 05:44.760
<b>Do your worst.</b>

05:44.840 --> 05:48.130
<b>No ninja would ever crack from this.</b>

05:48.840 --> 05:50.260
<b>I know.</b>

06:01.480 --> 06:03.570
<b>What are trying to accomplish?</b>

06:03.650 --> 06:05.610
<b>Just kill me already!</b>

06:24.630 --> 06:26.550
<b>Oh! I just remembered.</b>

06:26.840 --> 06:28.720
<b>Your woman...</b>

06:28.800 --> 06:32.600
<b>You should have seen the look she made,
it was the best!</b>

06:32.930 --> 06:36.310
<b>The kid's reaction was just typical fear,</b>

06:36.390 --> 06:38.770
<b>but that woman...</b>

06:38.850 --> 06:41.860
<b>her eyes glared with anger
and hatred until the end!</b>

06:41.940 --> 06:46.360
<b>And you know,
the more that I stabbed her the more she-</b>

06:46.440 --> 06:47.900
<b>Listen here.</b>

06:50.450 --> 06:53.530
<b>Burn those eyes into your memory forever.</b>

06:54.910 --> 06:57.950
<b>I'm about to drop
you into the pits of Hell.</b>

06:58.410 --> 07:01.420
<b>Pay close attention to the sounds
of skin peeling off,</b>

07:01.500 --> 07:05.250
<b>bones shattering,
and spines ripped out whole.</b>

07:05.340 --> 07:07.260
<b>Because there will be
no sweet release of death,</b>

07:07.340 --> 07:10.260
<b>in spite of you getting eviscerated
and your heart stopping.</b>

07:10.340 --> 07:14.890
<b>Even in oblivion, you'll tremble in fear
of the Oni that lie beyond!</b>

07:36.740 --> 07:38.160
<b>Oh, come on!</b>

07:38.580 --> 07:41.750
<b>Why the hell can't I
investigate this case?!</b>

07:41.830 --> 07:44.670
<b>You know we can't just pretend
that nothing happened!</b>

07:48.170 --> 07:49.090
<b>Emma!</b>

07:53.260 --> 07:55.260
<b>We've been over this already.</b>

07:55.720 --> 07:59.430
<b>Look, there's nothing we can do since
we don't know who the blood belongs to,</b>

07:59.520 --> 08:02.520
<b>nor do we have any
of the surveillance footage.</b>

08:02.810 --> 08:04.480
<b>That's just the reality of it.</b>

08:05.360 --> 08:07.940
<b>In any case,
it's a direct order from the top.</b>

08:08.020 --> 08:10.820
<b>Don't get involved
in this case any further.</b>

08:10.900 --> 08:13.610
<b>I don't remember you being
such a goddamn coward!</b>

08:14.160 --> 08:15.530
<b>Mike...</b>

08:15.620 --> 08:18.990
<b>I'd hate to see you get fired
right as you're about to retire.</b>

08:19.080 --> 08:21.200
<b>Just sit tight and pick up another case.</b>

08:21.290 --> 08:22.500
<b>What about Emma?!</b>

08:22.580 --> 08:23.500
<b>She's a witness!</b>

08:23.620 --> 08:26.500
<b>She saw Joe Logan
fighting against a huge group of guys!</b>

08:26.840 --> 08:28.250
<b>Are you sure?</b>

08:29.630 --> 08:31.920
<b>I suggest that you try asking her again.</b>

08:32.010 --> 08:33.260
<b>Huh?!</b>

08:35.930 --> 08:37.300
<b>EMMA!</b>

08:39.050 --> 08:40.850
<b>Seriously? What the hell?!</b>

08:41.180 --> 08:42.850
<b>Don't just roll over like a dog, dammit!</b>

08:42.930 --> 08:45.730
<b>Oh please, there's no point
in throwing a tantrum.</b>

08:45.810 --> 08:49.070
<b>The smarter play is to
just appear obedient on the surface.</b>

08:49.320 --> 08:50.730
<b>What does that mean?!</b>

08:50.820 --> 08:54.700
<b>I almost laughed at how blatantly
they're trying to cover this up.</b>

08:54.780 --> 08:57.410
<b>There's definitely something shady
going on with this case.</b>

08:57.490 --> 08:59.240
<b>We just need to play it cool.</b>

08:59.330 --> 09:00.790
<b>Unbelievable...</b>

09:00.870 --> 09:03.660
<b>So about the man who disappeared
from the hospital, Joe Logan.</b>

09:03.750 --> 09:06.500
<b>I did some digging into him
like you asked me to.</b>

09:06.580 --> 09:08.420
<b>It goes deeper than him.</b>

09:08.500 --> 09:15.050
<b>His murdered wife Sarah Logan and
even their son Kyle Logan are all aliases.</b>

09:15.130 --> 09:16.930
<b>None of them actually exist.</b>

09:17.010 --> 09:17.840
<b>Huh?</b>

09:17.930 --> 09:20.640
<b>It turns out they're the same
as all the previous victims.</b>

09:20.720 --> 09:22.560
<b>So your intuition was right on the money.</b>

09:22.640 --> 09:23.730
<b>Shit...</b>

09:23.810 --> 09:25.770
<b>What the hell is going on here?!</b>

09:36.400 --> 09:37.860
<b>It's finally ready!</b>

09:38.620 --> 09:40.490
<b>This will help protect everyone.</b>

09:41.990 --> 09:43.160
<b>And you, too.</b>

11:08.040 --> 11:09.080
<b>Nice ass, sexy.</b>

11:09.160 --> 11:11.580
<b>Hey! Get your hands off me!</b>

11:18.170 --> 11:19.510
<b>This ain't enough.</b>

11:19.590 --> 11:21.010
<b>That's all I can affo-</b>

11:22.970 --> 11:24.470
<b>I didn't catch that.</b>

11:28.980 --> 11:31.690
<b>Does that bike out front belong to you?</b>

11:31.980 --> 11:35.900
<b>Ya see, there's been a rash of motorcycle
thefts around these parts lately.</b>

11:35.980 --> 11:37.940
<b>That ain't one of 'em, is it?</b>

11:39.860 --> 11:42.530
<b>Hey, show me your license.</b>

11:45.620 --> 11:47.370
<b>Don't try and play dumb with m-</b>

11:57.170 --> 11:58.210
<b>You sonnova...!</b>

12:34.120 --> 12:37.540
<b>So... hard at work having fun, I see.</b>

12:37.630 --> 12:40.630
<b>Criminals are cutting their deals
in VR these days.</b>

12:40.710 --> 12:42.590
<b>You read the report, didn't you?</b>

12:42.920 --> 12:45.090
<b>We need to get this out of the way first.</b>

12:45.180 --> 12:48.180
<b>Otherwise we won't have time
to go after Logan, you know.</b>

12:48.260 --> 12:51.100
<b>I don't get the big deal about
this "virtual space" or whatever.</b>

12:51.180 --> 12:53.850
<b>It's not like aliens
beamed the technology down to us.</b>

12:53.940 --> 12:57.020
<b>Advancements in VR have exploded
in the past couple years.</b>

12:57.110 --> 12:59.070
<b>And it's all thanks to AUZA.</b>

12:59.150 --> 13:01.030
<b>Right, AUZA...</b>

13:04.860 --> 13:06.160
<b>Mike Morris here.</b>

13:08.070 --> 13:09.410
<b>This is Joe Logan.</b>

13:17.630 --> 13:20.750
<b>The man named Joe Logan doesn't exist.</b>

13:21.130 --> 13:23.260
<b>So, who are you really?</b>

13:24.220 --> 13:26.300
<b>I also have questions for you.</b>

13:26.720 --> 13:28.010
<b>Let's talk.</b>

13:28.390 --> 13:31.430
<b>The hell do you mean?
We're talking right now aren't we?</b>

13:32.850 --> 13:34.020
<b>He hung up!</b>

13:36.310 --> 13:37.310
<b>That you, Logan?!</b>

13:37.690 --> 13:40.650
<b>No more funny business.
This is your last chance.</b>

13:40.730 --> 13:43.030
<b>Looks like somebody can't take a joke.</b>

13:43.280 --> 13:45.200
<b>Whoa, whoa, stay on the line!</b>

13:45.280 --> 13:47.200
<b>I'm sorry, don't hang up!</b>

13:48.620 --> 13:50.910
<b>So, what do you want from me?</b>

13:50.990 --> 13:52.240
<b>Give me a location.</b>

13:52.330 --> 13:54.200
<b>You're gonna let me decide?</b>

13:55.080 --> 13:56.870
<b>All right, then.</b>

13:57.000 --> 14:00.540
<b>Let's meet up at this Chinese restaurant
in St. Marks called Long Hao Bao.</b>

14:01.250 --> 14:03.090
<b>I can be there by tomorrow night.</b>

14:16.640 --> 14:18.900
<b>"From the cradle to the grave."</b>

14:18.980 --> 14:21.400
<b>Those words were once used to
describe the social security system</b>

14:21.480 --> 14:23.110
<b>of a certain country.</b>

14:23.400 --> 14:26.990
<b>However, there is something
more deserving of that phrase now.</b>

14:27.070 --> 14:29.320
<b>And that is us here at AUZA!</b>

14:29.610 --> 14:34.450
<b>From the cradle to the grave,
AUZA technology works to support you,</b>

14:34.540 --> 14:37.790
<b>your family, and even your friends,</b>

14:37.870 --> 14:40.130
<b>in every aspect of life
that you can imagine.</b>

15:04.070 --> 15:05.440
<b>This place is the perfect meetup spot</b>

15:05.530 --> 15:07.190
<b>since there are never
any customers around.</b>

15:07.280 --> 15:09.450
<b>Oh, shut the hell up, jackass!</b>

15:09.530 --> 15:11.280
<b>Off with you, pal.</b>

15:11.360 --> 15:16.330
<b>Hey, this is my store!
You don't get to order me around!</b>

15:16.410 --> 15:17.950
<b>All right, fine.</b>

15:18.040 --> 15:21.000
<b>I keep telling you not to do this
during the dinner rush!</b>

15:21.290 --> 15:22.750
<b>Uh-huh, "rush"...</b>

15:23.290 --> 15:25.590
<b>If one of the delivery guys shows up,</b>

15:25.670 --> 15:29.550
<b>just tell 'em to check that table
and make sure they get the right order!</b>

15:29.630 --> 15:31.890
<b>Hold up, you're not using drones yet?</b>

15:32.430 --> 15:34.300
<b>You know this ain't AUZA City.</b>

15:41.060 --> 15:42.190
<b>Remember.</b>

15:42.270 --> 15:45.020
<b>You gotta pay for anything
that gets busted.</b>

15:46.020 --> 15:47.780
<b>I'll be back in 30 minutes.</b>

15:47.860 --> 15:49.030
<b>Pain in the ass...</b>

15:52.200 --> 15:56.160
<b>I was starting to think that maybe
you fell over and died somewhere.</b>

15:57.580 --> 15:58.910
<b>Let me see your face.</b>

15:59.410 --> 16:01.330
<b>I wanna make sure you're the real deal.</b>

16:03.290 --> 16:05.170
<b>That's not gonna cut it.</b>

16:06.000 --> 16:07.210
<b>Hold on!</b>

16:08.840 --> 16:11.720
<b>I was half-expecting you
to not even show up.</b>

16:11.800 --> 16:14.720
<b>Didn't you think of the risk
of getting caught?</b>

16:17.970 --> 16:20.430
<b>I didn't come here for small talk.</b>

16:21.060 --> 16:22.440
<b>What do you wanna know?</b>

16:22.520 --> 16:25.060
<b>About whoever is responsible
for the serial murders.</b>

16:25.150 --> 16:26.560
<b>You got any leads?</b>

16:26.650 --> 16:27.610
<b>What?</b>

16:27.690 --> 16:29.610
<b>Any small detail is fine.</b>

16:30.110 --> 16:33.610
<b>And you're gonna return the favor
by answering my questions?</b>

16:34.410 --> 16:35.570
<b>Yes.</b>

16:37.030 --> 16:38.330
<b>Then let me ask you,</b>

16:38.410 --> 16:41.830
<b>do I look like the type to cut
a deal with a potential suspect?!</b>

16:41.910 --> 16:43.870
<b>Or that I'd let them go freely?!</b>

16:43.960 --> 16:45.000
<b>Well, too bad!</b>

16:45.080 --> 16:48.170
<b>Get down on your knees and put your hands
behind your head.</b>

16:48.250 --> 16:50.920
<b>Then start talking!
What happened at the hospital?!</b>

16:51.010 --> 16:52.300
<b>AUZA Eats here!</b>

16:52.970 --> 16:55.340
<b>Order for gyoza,
chili fried shrimp, mapo tofu...</b>

16:55.430 --> 16:57.300
<b>Yep, looks like it's all here.</b>

16:59.310 --> 17:00.810
<b>Why didn't you try to make a break for it?</b>

17:00.890 --> 17:02.480
<b>Because we're not done talking.</b>

17:03.020 --> 17:05.350
<b>Trust me, you and I are gonna have a
nice long talk back at the stati-</b>

17:05.440 --> 17:06.940
<b>AUZA Eats here.</b>

17:07.650 --> 17:10.070
<b>Fried rice, egg roll, twice cooked pork.</b>

17:10.150 --> 17:11.440
<b>Got it, thanks!</b>

17:13.320 --> 17:14.950
<b>Don't try anything funny!</b>

17:21.240 --> 17:22.160
<b>Get up!</b>

17:22.410 --> 17:24.290
<b>I'm arresting you right here and now.</b>

17:28.420 --> 17:30.710
<b>Order's on the table! Just find it and go!</b>

17:31.710 --> 17:32.760
<b>Huh?</b>

17:48.150 --> 17:49.150
<b>Who is that?!</b>

17:57.990 --> 17:59.910
<b>Freeze! Don't move!</b>

17:59.990 --> 18:00.950
<b>Same to you!</b>

19:18.280 --> 19:19.280
<b>I gotta know...</b>

19:19.860 --> 19:21.910
<b>who the hell are you?!</b>

19:24.830 --> 19:26.410
<b>Peking Duck.</b>

19:28.120 --> 19:29.870
<b>Where's the guy from the hospital?!</b>

19:29.960 --> 19:31.210
<b>Answer me!</b>

19:32.580 --> 19:35.250
<b>I am... a ninja.</b>

19:35.710 --> 19:36.920
<b>What?!</b>

19:38.260 --> 19:41.300
<b>Same with these guys and
the ones who attacked me at the hospital.</b>
