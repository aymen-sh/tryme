<b>Me, me! Pick me!</b>

00:02.960 --> 00:04.540
<b>Me, me! I know it!</b>

00:04.620 --> 00:06.250
<b>Let's ask… Hana!</b>

00:06.750 --> 00:07.670
<b>Yes, ma'am!</b>

00:09.380 --> 00:12.420
<b>I'm so glad we asked Shin and Lu
to mind the store today.</b>

00:12.920 --> 00:15.090
<b>I wonder how they're doing.</b>

00:15.180 --> 00:17.300
<b>They're fine… Probably.</b>

00:17.390 --> 00:18.220
<b>SAKAMOTO'S</b>

00:18.300 --> 00:19.310
<b>Hey, Lu!</b>

00:19.390 --> 00:22.600
<b>Stop wearing my apron for dirty tasks!</b>

00:22.680 --> 00:27.190
<b>You make a fuss over everything!
You wash the windows, then!</b>

00:27.270 --> 00:28.310
<b>No way!</b>

00:28.900 --> 00:30.280
<b>Let me be clear.</b>

00:30.780 --> 00:35.320
<b>While Mr. Sakamoto and Ms. Aoi are out,
I'm the one in charge of this place.</b>

00:35.410 --> 00:37.530
<b>Yeah, yeah, whatever.</b>

00:37.620 --> 00:40.330
<b><i>Shin is like a little kid sometimes…</i></b>

00:40.830 --> 00:44.250
<b>Anything you want to say to me,
say it to my face, Lu.</b>

00:44.330 --> 00:46.250
<b>You know I can hear it anyway.</b>

00:46.330 --> 00:48.790
<b>I still have freedom of thought.</b>

00:48.880 --> 00:52.340
<b>You're the one
reading my mind without permission.</b>

00:52.420 --> 00:55.760
<b>Yo, got any pork buns you're throwing out?
I'd be happy to help.</b>

00:55.840 --> 00:59.140
<b>Who reads people's minds anyway?
That's totally perverted!</b>

00:59.220 --> 01:01.810
<b>You dumb blond, mind-stalking creep!</b>

01:01.890 --> 01:04.730
<b>Shut up, you apron-stealing drunk!</b>

01:06.480 --> 01:09.730
<b>How could I ever be comfortable around you

01:13.650 --> 01:15.070
<b>Is that how it is?</b>

01:15.150 --> 01:16.360
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

01:18.450 --> 01:20.910
<b>Hey, shouldn't you stop him?</b>

01:21.410 --> 01:22.370
<b>Who cares?</b>

01:26.410 --> 01:27.620
<b>Mind if I eat these?</b>

01:28.120 --> 01:29.500
<b>You get out of here too.</b>

01:34.880 --> 01:36.260
<b>So annoying.</b>

01:38.300 --> 01:40.760
<b><i>I've never seen Shin like that…</i></b>

01:42.180 --> 01:45.850
<b>Back already, huh?
Fine, I'll let you apologize…</b>

01:49.230 --> 01:50.940
<b>SHIN</b>

01:51.020 --> 01:51.860
<b>It's him.</b>

01:52.570 --> 01:53.940
<b>You're coming with us.</b>

03:27.490 --> 03:30.370
<b>JURASSIC BASTARD</b>

03:30.960 --> 03:32.170
<b>Man, what a surprise!</b>

03:32.250 --> 03:35.920
<b>A subject that disappeared from the Lab
11 years ago,</b>

03:36.000 --> 03:38.880
<b>living carefree, in a town like this?</b>

03:38.960 --> 03:41.470
<b>Dyed his hair and everything too.</b>

03:42.470 --> 03:45.720
<b>Hey, Mr. Tanaka,
I don't know how to tell you this, but…</b>

03:45.800 --> 03:47.140
<b>What is it, Seba?</b>

03:47.810 --> 03:49.810
<b>I think we have the wrong person.</b>

03:52.850 --> 03:54.900
<b>Of course it's him!</b>

03:54.980 --> 03:57.150
<b>The nametag says "Shin," plain and simple!</b>

03:57.230 --> 03:59.150
<b>I'll kill you, you little shit!</b>

03:59.230 --> 04:00.240
<b>M'kay, sorry.</b>

04:00.320 --> 04:03.240
<b>Why are we kidnapping the brat anyway?</b>

04:03.820 --> 04:06.200
<b>I don't know the whole story,</b>

04:06.280 --> 04:09.490
<b>but remember how the Lab
used to do experiments to create psychics?</b>

04:10.290 --> 04:12.870
<b><i>He's the only subject it worked on.</i></b>

04:12.960 --> 04:15.460
<b><i>Apparently, he can really read minds.</i></b>

04:16.630 --> 04:18.670
<b>Talk about creepy, huh?</b>

04:18.750 --> 04:21.670
<b>Your every thought being read at any time?</b>

04:21.760 --> 04:24.470
<b>Who would want to be near someone
that could do that?</b>

04:25.050 --> 04:28.720
<b>I bet no one likes him,
and no one ever will.</b>

04:28.810 --> 04:31.470
<b>What a miserable loser. Ha ha ha!</b>

04:34.690 --> 04:35.850
<b>Mr. Tanaka!</b>

04:35.940 --> 04:37.610
<b>How dare you.</b>

04:38.150 --> 04:40.650
<b>Shin might be dumb and picky and immature,</b>

04:40.730 --> 04:43.190
<b>but he's a much better person than you!</b>

04:43.990 --> 04:47.820
<b>What's wrong with being different
in the first place?</b>

04:47.910 --> 04:49.700
<b>There's nothing miserable about that!</b>

04:49.780 --> 04:51.700
<b>Wait a minute.</b>

04:51.790 --> 04:53.330
<b>What's your name?</b>

04:53.410 --> 04:55.540
<b>Me? I'm Lu Shaotang.</b>

04:55.620 --> 04:56.460
<b>What?</b>

04:56.540 --> 04:58.420
<b>See? I told you so.</b>

04:58.500 --> 05:01.500
<b>You seriously need to listen to people,
Mr. Tanaka.</b>

05:03.630 --> 05:07.680
<b>Oh, well.
I guess I gotta be the bigger man here.</b>

05:08.800 --> 05:11.680
<b>All right, Lu. I'll let you apologize…</b>

05:12.640 --> 05:14.930
<b>Huh? Is she slacking off again?</b>

05:22.940 --> 05:24.190
<b>We're back!</b>

05:24.940 --> 05:26.240
<b>Mr. Sakamoto…</b>

05:28.030 --> 05:29.120
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

05:30.950 --> 05:33.950
<b>Then, when I got back, Lu was gone.</b>

05:34.540 --> 05:37.670
<b>I'm sorry, sir. This is all my fault!</b>

05:37.750 --> 05:40.250
<b>She's on the highway, heading southwest.</b>

05:40.330 --> 05:42.630
<b>What? Mr. Sakamoto, how do you--</b>

05:42.710 --> 05:43.550
<b>SHIN</b>

05:43.630 --> 05:47.220
<b><i>The name tag has a GPS in it.</i></b>

05:47.840 --> 05:49.720
<b>You morons!</b>

05:49.800 --> 05:52.220
<b>They're definitely gonna kill us for this!</b>

05:52.310 --> 05:53.140
<b>Bet.</b>

05:53.220 --> 05:55.520
<b>Get us off this highway now, you slowpoke!</b>

05:55.600 --> 05:57.520
<b>The next exit isn't for 15 kilometers.</b>

05:57.600 --> 06:01.110
<b>Damn it! This is why I hate fieldwork.</b>

06:01.190 --> 06:04.150
<b>I know. Maybe we can pretend
that that's Shin.</b>

06:04.230 --> 06:06.820
<b>We tell them he lost his psychic ability.</b>

06:06.900 --> 06:09.030
<b>They'll notice she's a girl, though.</b>

06:09.110 --> 06:09.950
<b>Crap!</b>

06:10.030 --> 06:11.990
<b><i>Stupid me.</i></b>

06:12.080 --> 06:14.950
<b><i>This is karma</i>
<i>for saying something so mean to Shin.</i></b>

06:15.620 --> 06:17.660
<b>How could I ever
be comfortable around you?!</b>

06:18.540 --> 06:21.380
<b><i>I didn't mean that at all.</i></b>

06:21.460 --> 06:23.210
<b><i>I wish I could've said sorry…</i></b>

06:33.890 --> 06:36.430
<b>We'd like our pork bun chef back now.</b>

06:36.520 --> 06:39.690
<b>Shin! Mr. Manager!</b>

06:40.190 --> 06:42.060
<b>What? Is that the real Shin?</b>

06:42.150 --> 06:44.480
<b>It is! It's the kid from the photo, Seba!</b>

06:44.570 --> 06:45.480
<b>Congrats.</b>

06:45.570 --> 06:48.440
<b>We can go back to the Lab
without fearing for our lives!</b>

06:49.780 --> 06:52.200
<b><i>They're with the Lab?</i></b>

06:52.280 --> 06:54.120
<b>Get 'em, guys!</b>

06:59.210 --> 07:02.130
<b>Hey there, fatty. Time for a nap!</b>

07:09.220 --> 07:10.380
<b>What?!</b>

07:10.470 --> 07:12.720
<b>Hey, mind if I use some of these?</b>

07:12.800 --> 07:14.800
<b>Sure! As many as you like!</b>

07:20.640 --> 07:22.190
<b>Damn it! You little…</b>

07:22.270 --> 07:24.690
<b>Wow! You guys shooting a movie?</b>

07:24.770 --> 07:25.610
<b>Sure.</b>

07:31.610 --> 07:34.820
<b>Who are those guys? They're insane!</b>

07:34.910 --> 07:36.530
<b>Wait, we lost all of them?</b>

07:36.620 --> 07:37.870
<b>It seems like it.</b>

07:37.950 --> 07:39.870
<b>You'd better stop this!</b>

07:39.950 --> 07:42.960
<b>Apologize before things get worse.</b>

07:43.790 --> 07:45.460
<b>Shut it back there!</b>

07:46.000 --> 07:48.130
<b>If we go back empty-handed,</b>

07:48.210 --> 07:50.340
<b>what'll happen then is so much worse…</b>

07:50.420 --> 07:52.680
<b>You're no exception.
If they don't need you…</b>

07:53.840 --> 07:55.640
<b>Lu, are you all right? Lu!</b>

07:55.720 --> 07:57.810
<b>Seba! Help, Seba!</b>

07:57.890 --> 08:01.600
<b>Fine, I'll do it. Take the wheel for me.</b>

08:08.570 --> 08:11.240
<b>I'd better get paid extra for this.</b>

08:12.530 --> 08:14.160
<b>You want a fight? Okay.</b>

08:14.240 --> 08:16.870
<b>I'm counting on you, Seba!</b>

08:16.950 --> 08:18.280
<b>Yeah, yeah.</b>

08:18.370 --> 08:22.120
<b>Having an incompetent boss
is a lot of work.</b>

08:33.930 --> 08:36.300
<b>Careful, Mr. Sakamoto!</b>

08:38.890 --> 08:42.310
<b>Impressive. You're pretty sharp, huh?</b>

08:44.310 --> 08:45.520
<b>Whoa, scary dude.</b>

08:45.600 --> 08:47.440
<b>Please let me go.</b>

08:54.700 --> 08:55.610
<b>Mr. Sakamoto!</b>

08:58.450 --> 09:02.790
<b>I get why he's "the legendary hit man."
I thought I'd die out there.</b>

09:02.870 --> 09:04.540
<b>Hey, did you get Shin?</b>

09:05.620 --> 09:08.080
<b>Oh yeah, I forgot about that.</b>

09:08.170 --> 09:10.000
<b>Come on, Seba!</b>

09:11.750 --> 09:15.090
<b>Damn it.
Losing the motorbike is a tough blow.</b>

09:15.680 --> 09:18.640
<b><i>The GPS has stopped at Okutabi.</i></b>

09:18.720 --> 09:20.300
<b><i>Who are those men?</i></b>

09:21.010 --> 09:22.680
<b>I believe they're with the Lab.</b>

09:23.180 --> 09:24.310
<b><i>The Lab?</i></b>

09:24.390 --> 09:25.520
<b>Yes.</b>

09:25.600 --> 09:29.110
<b>It's an unauthorized research facility,
and it's where I grew up.</b>

09:30.310 --> 09:31.150
<b>The thing is,</b>

09:33.070 --> 09:35.530
<b><i>they were a group of weirdos,</i></b>

09:35.610 --> 09:38.660
<b><i>but they weren't dangerous like that.</i></b>

09:39.240 --> 09:40.410
<b>I wonder what happened…</b>

09:41.240 --> 09:42.660
<b>In any case,</b>

09:43.540 --> 09:45.450
<b>we're going to go get Lu back.</b>

09:52.130 --> 09:53.630
<b>So this is the Lab.</b>

09:53.710 --> 09:56.630
<b>Yes. This is a facade they use to hide it.</b>

09:57.300 --> 09:59.510
<b>The Lab is in the basement.</b>

10:00.640 --> 10:03.140
<b>How about we pay a visit
to your childhood home?</b>

10:03.720 --> 10:04.640
<b>Let's do it.</b>

10:16.820 --> 10:18.490
<b><i>It's pretty crowded.</i></b>

10:18.570 --> 10:21.570
<b>They operate a normal museum

<b>Welcome to Okutabi Science Museum,

<b>Would you like a souvenir photo?</b>

10:28.250 --> 10:29.750
<b>No, we're in a bit of a hurry.</b>

10:29.830 --> 10:31.540
<b>Come on, what's the harm?</b>

10:31.630 --> 10:33.000
<b>We don't care for photos.</b>

10:33.590 --> 10:35.090
<b>It'll only take a second!</b>

10:35.170 --> 10:36.510
<b>No thank you!</b>

10:36.590 --> 10:38.670
<b>All right, dinosaur poses, please!</b>

10:38.760 --> 10:39.590
<b>Say "roar"!</b>

10:41.930 --> 10:45.390
<b>You can purchase big prints for 4,900 yen.</b>

10:45.470 --> 10:46.810
<b>I'll take one, please.</b>

10:46.890 --> 10:47.730
<b>LIKED IT</b>

10:50.310 --> 10:52.400
<b>This is perfect for hiding our faces.</b>

10:52.480 --> 10:54.110
<b><i>Soft to the touch too.</i></b>

10:54.190 --> 10:56.150
<b>This way.</b>

10:56.230 --> 10:59.200
<b>There's a secret passage to the Lab

11:17.300 --> 11:18.380
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

11:19.920 --> 11:23.090
<b>Is that the boy with telepathic abilities?</b>

11:24.260 --> 11:25.180
<b>Yes…</b>

11:26.470 --> 11:30.850
<b>The hair color and gender

11:48.040 --> 11:48.910
<b>Yes, Mr. Seba?</b>

11:49.660 --> 11:53.920
<b>So, this one's a phony body double,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.750
<b>Seba?!</b>

without damaging it!</b>

14:07.680 --> 14:09.390
<b><i>Brilliant idea, Shin.</i></b>

14:10.010 --> 14:11.010
<b><i>Brilliant?</i></b>

14:32.320 --> 14:33.990
<b>Yes, it worked!</b>

14:34.870 --> 14:38.290
<b><i>System rebooted.</i>
<i>Target engagement level, max.</i></b>

14:46.010 --> 14:47.130
<b>Mr. Sakamoto!</b>

14:59.730 --> 15:01.150
<b>His gun!</b>

15:05.440 --> 15:07.070
<b><i>This is getting annoying.</i></b>

15:08.780 --> 15:10.820
<b>Scrap the plan of taking it alive.</b>

15:43.440 --> 15:47.860
<b>After all, the fact that they don't move
is what makes dinosaurs so fascinating.</b>

15:48.440 --> 15:49.860
<b>Whatever you say, sir.</b>

15:52.200 --> 15:53.240
<b>It's gone quiet.</b>

15:53.910 --> 15:55.070
<b>What was that?</b>

15:55.160 --> 15:58.290
<b>Could it have been the security system
at the entrance?</b>

15:58.870 --> 16:02.410
<b>Hey, you shitty scientists!
Get back to work.</b>

16:02.500 --> 16:04.380
<b>You have to let us rest.</b>

16:04.460 --> 16:06.380
<b>We haven't slept in three days.</b>

16:06.460 --> 16:10.010
<b>If you want to be freed,
get us those results!</b>

16:10.090 --> 16:11.760
<b>You good-for-nothing scientists!</b>

16:12.510 --> 16:14.130
<b>-Dr. Ishikawa!
-Dr. Ishikawa!</b>

16:15.050 --> 16:18.510
<b>Do you seriously think
this silly research could ever succeed?</b>

16:19.100 --> 16:20.520
<b>"This silly research"?</b>

16:21.180 --> 16:24.270
<b>You let your mouth run a little too much.</b>

16:24.850 --> 16:27.270
<b>For your disrespect
toward the organization,</b>

16:27.360 --> 16:28.190
<b>you'll die!</b>

16:35.030 --> 16:36.030
<b>Hey.</b>

16:36.120 --> 16:39.280
<b>I know it's been a while,
but what the heck's going on?</b>

16:39.870 --> 16:40.700
<b>Shin!</b>

16:40.790 --> 16:41.910
<b>It's Shin.</b>

16:42.000 --> 16:43.290
<b>You came back?</b>

16:44.040 --> 16:45.870
<b>I had some business here.</b>

16:45.960 --> 16:47.040
<b>Where's the old man?</b>

16:47.670 --> 16:50.460
<b>The director has been locked up
in the lowest floor.</b>

16:50.550 --> 16:54.760
<b>The Lab has been taken over
by an assassin group.</b>

16:55.430 --> 16:56.590
<b>An assassin group?</b>

16:57.720 --> 17:00.600
<b>They appeared out of the blue,
about a year ago.</b>

17:02.220 --> 17:03.730
<b>Nice to meet you all.</b>

17:03.810 --> 17:09.110
<b>My name is Kashima. I'm a hit man.</b>

17:09.690 --> 17:14.280
<b>We are looking to innovate
our means of assassination.</b>

17:14.360 --> 17:16.570
<b>Guns and knives are things of the past.</b>

17:17.160 --> 17:20.870
<b>We'd like to incorporate the newest tech
in killing too.</b>

17:21.370 --> 17:25.830
<b>That's where we need the help
of your brilliant minds.</b>

17:25.910 --> 17:28.920
<b><i>Kashima's the boss</i>
<i>who's at the center of everything.</i></b>

17:29.000 --> 17:32.340
<b><i>There are a few other leaders,</i>
<i>then the henchmen in hazmat suits.</i></b>

17:32.840 --> 17:34.590
<b>I had no idea…</b>

17:35.090 --> 17:38.760
<b>Mr. Sakamoto, if we're going
to comb through this place to find Lu…</b>

17:39.260 --> 17:41.760
<b>We'll probably have to fight them, yes.</b>

17:42.350 --> 17:43.600
<b>What are you thinking?!</b>

17:43.680 --> 17:45.930
<b>You two have to get out of here fast.</b>

17:46.020 --> 17:48.020
<b>The leader in charge of this floor is--</b>

17:51.820 --> 17:52.940
<b>Here he comes! Hide!</b>

17:53.030 --> 17:53.860
<b>Hurry!</b>

17:54.440 --> 17:55.780
<b>Don't just stand there!</b>

18:02.120 --> 18:03.740
<b>I don't wanna be a guinea pig!</b>

18:03.830 --> 18:06.410
<b>Please! At least let <i>me</i> out!</b>

18:06.500 --> 18:07.750
<b>Stop whining already!</b>

18:09.330 --> 18:12.380
<b>How mean. You barbaric woman.</b>

18:13.380 --> 18:16.010
<b>What is that you've been doing anyway?</b>

18:16.550 --> 18:19.430
<b>Isn't it obvious?
I'm breaking out of this cell!</b>

18:19.510 --> 18:22.220
<b>Huh? Using that little rock?</b>

18:22.300 --> 18:23.850
<b>You've got to be kidding me.</b>

18:23.930 --> 18:26.520
<b>He's right, little lady.</b>

18:27.020 --> 18:28.480
<b>You don't want to do that.</b>

18:29.770 --> 18:31.610
<b>Who are you, old man?</b>

18:32.230 --> 18:34.940
<b>I'm Asakura, the director of this place.</b>

18:35.530 --> 18:38.450
<b>Could I interest you two
in a little prison break?</b>

18:45.040 --> 18:47.200
<b>What's all the excitement over here?</b>

18:47.290 --> 18:50.000
<b>We having some fun with an experiment?</b>

18:50.080 --> 18:51.460
<b>LEADER, MAD HORIGUCHI</b>

18:52.130 --> 18:53.960
<b>You have to let me join.</b>

18:54.550 --> 18:55.800
<b>No, there's nothing.</b>

18:56.960 --> 18:59.680
<b>Mind if I borrow your pen?</b>

19:04.140 --> 19:05.060
<b>Liar.</b>

19:07.640 --> 19:09.100
<b><i>That bastard!</i></b>

19:09.180 --> 19:10.600
<b><i>I'm stuck…</i></b>

19:10.690 --> 19:13.860
<b>One of my guys over there's passed out.</b>

19:13.940 --> 19:16.610
<b>What're you kids hiding, hmm?</b>

19:17.940 --> 19:20.320
<b>So? Who's gonna tell me?</b>

19:20.400 --> 19:22.070
<b>Pens out, everyone!</b>

19:27.450 --> 19:29.370
<b>See? I knew it.</b>

19:31.250 --> 19:33.380
<b>Good reflexes for an old guy like you.</b>

19:33.960 --> 19:36.460
<b>You idiot! Why did you come out?</b>

19:37.920 --> 19:38.840
<b>No reason.</b>

19:41.340 --> 19:44.260
<b>I don't like small spaces.</b>

19:46.180 --> 19:47.010
<b>Shin…</b>

19:47.680 --> 19:49.100
<b>Are you one of the leaders?</b>

19:50.140 --> 19:52.140
<b>What if I am?</b>

19:52.230 --> 19:54.310
<b>Are you going to get in our way?</b>

19:54.810 --> 19:56.230
<b>That won't do!</b>

19:56.820 --> 19:59.610
<b>This is some marvelous research
we're doing here!</b>

20:00.820 --> 20:03.490
<b>Here, let me show you myself!</b>

20:17.090 --> 20:17.960
<b>Shin!</b>

20:19.340 --> 20:22.510
<b>All right! Time for a lovely experiment!</b>

20:23.800 --> 20:24.800
<b>OW, THAT HURT!</b>

20:24.890 --> 20:25.930
<b>YOU JERK!</b>

20:26.010 --> 20:27.010
<b>WHAT?</b>

20:29.680 --> 20:32.940
<b>Great, isn't it?
A switch that switches around your words.</b>

20:33.020 --> 20:36.190
<b>I've embedded a needle in your head
that transmits a current,</b>

20:36.270 --> 20:39.440
<b>messing up the signals in your brain.</b>

20:39.520 --> 20:40.940
<b>WHAT THE HELL?</b>

20:41.030 --> 20:41.940
<b>FIX THIS NOW!</b>

20:45.820 --> 20:47.240
<b>Next, let's try… Oh?</b>

20:58.290 --> 20:59.380
<b>Finally got out.</b>

20:59.460 --> 21:00.630
<b>MR. SAKAMOTO!!</b>

21:00.710 --> 21:02.880
<b>Huh? Looks like you're having fun.</b>

21:02.970 --> 21:05.130
<b>DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME!!</b>

21:06.970 --> 21:07.800
<b>Shin,</b>

21:08.720 --> 21:11.640
<b>I don't know what happened in your past.</b>

21:11.720 --> 21:14.140
<b>But do you want to save this place?</b>

21:16.480 --> 21:17.650
<b>I DO…</b>

21:18.520 --> 21:19.440
<b>Okay, then.</b>

21:20.070 --> 21:22.650
<b>Time to clean up your childhood home.</b>

21:22.730 --> 21:23.940
<b>YES, SIR!</b>

21:27.200 --> 21:30.990
<b>I haven't taken a bus in ages.
My back hurts.</b>

21:31.080 --> 21:33.950
<b>Mr. Shishiba, let's eat these.</b>

21:34.040 --> 21:35.750
<b>Ah, your good-luck ritual.</b>

21:37.210 --> 21:41.000
<b>Honestly, are we sure
this place has something to do with Slur?</b>

21:41.090 --> 21:44.510
<b>Nagumo's not the most reliable chap,
is he?</b>

21:44.590 --> 21:47.510
<b>Investigating that is part of our job.</b>

21:48.090 --> 21:50.850
<b>Fair enough. Ready, Osaragi?</b>

21:50.930 --> 21:51.760
<b>Yes.</b>
