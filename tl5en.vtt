WEBVTT

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.520
Freedom... freedom!

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.520
Freedom... freedom!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.920
Fuck you, FEDRA... fuck you, FEDRA!

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.160
Kansas City belongs to the people.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.840
Collaborators, surrender now
and you will receive a fair trial.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.680
We have control of the QZ
and the open city.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.960
Anyone caught hiding
will face charges

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.280
of counter-revolutionary activities.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.120
Kansas City belongs to the people.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.920
Collaborators, surrender now...

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.120
You know, Perry, I used to be
so scared of these people.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.480
Now look at them.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.320
Did it feel good

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.400
betraying your neighbors to FEDRA?

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.320
Watching us get thrown in prison

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.960
watching us hang

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.960
so that you could get medicine

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.520
alcohol, fucking... apples?

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.640
Did it make you feel better?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.480
Did it make you feel safe?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.200
How does it make you feel now?

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.200
Well, I'm not FEDRA.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.600
Lucky for you

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.440
no one here has to die.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.240
Yeah, we could put you on trial.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.320
You're all guilty,
so that's how that'll go.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400
And you'll do some time. Easy.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.080
But first, you have to do
something for me.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.600
Where is Henry?

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.840
You're informers.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.600
Inform.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.720
Where is Henry?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.120
I guess they don't know.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.720
- Kill them.
- He's with Edelstein.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.840
Edelstein was a collaborator?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.760
Well, he was a lot more discreet
than you fucking idiots.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.360
Where are they?

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.520
He said he was meeting up
with Henry and Sam.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.480
- Okay.
- He had a place

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.400
to hole up in the open city

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.280
in case things went bad.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.000
But things have gone great,
haven't you heard?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.440
Kansas City is free.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.400
Hole up where?

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.880
He didn't say.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.120
I swear, I've told you
everything I know.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.320
Of course, you have.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.680
You're a rat.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.160
He's still in the city, okay?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.680
I want our people going door-to-door
until we find him.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.520
- Now?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.200
How long do you think
we should wait?

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.520
Should we wait a day or two?
Should we wait a week?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.680
Oh, fuck it,
Let's give him a month.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.280
I'm not saying we do nothing.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.936
We already got a perimeter
around the city. We can wait him out.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.176
Door-to-door would take a lot of men

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.256
and there are other things
that probably need...

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.000
He's not my seventh priority, Perry.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.000
Is that what he is to you?

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.120
No.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.880
Are we really putting them on trial?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.560
No, we are not really
putting them on trial.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.840
When you're done,
burn the bodies. It's faster.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.360
You sure they don't know about this?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.480
I got it from a FEDRA officer.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.480
Patient.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.280
Owed me a favor.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.360
He said he found it himself,
never told anyone about it.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.400
- And what if they get to him?
- They already did.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.320
- He won't be talking.
- Fuck.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.440
Okay. Water? Toilets?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.320
The apartments below
are tied into the QZ main.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.840
We can use those,
but we have to be fast and careful.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.640
- Food?
- Whatever you brought.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.400
I barely made it out as is.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.680
So we're fucked on food?

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.440
- Ammunition?
- Empty.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.840
Yeah, so is mine.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.960
We weren't shooting our way
out of this anyway.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.640
No, so we'll sneak our way out.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960
How?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.480
- Tunnels.
- Tunnels?

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.720
Why go to the trouble?

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.480
You can kill yourself right here.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.440
Twenty cans, and six pounds of jerky
for the three of us.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.120
If we stick to the minimum

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.000
I think we can make it 11 days?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.320
So that's how long we have
to figure it out.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.960
Is he scared?

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.720
Yeah. Well, he saw a lot.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.480
Nothing I can do about that now.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.320
He's scared because you're scared.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.240
What?

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.880
Yeah...

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.000
Joel.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.360
Joel!

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.760
Eyes on me. Eyes on me.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.880
You don't have to worry
about what to say.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.200
We don't wanna hurt you.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.760
We wanna help you.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.600
Okay.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.040
Okay...

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.856
I don't know what the next step is
with something like this

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.280
but if I lower my gun

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.680
we didn't hurt you

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.280
so you don't hurt us.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.960
Right?

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.520
That's right.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.936
That's a weird fucking tone, man.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.816
That's just the way he sounds.
He has an asshole voice.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.320
Joel, tell him he's okay.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.760
- Everything is great.
- Dude.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.000
Fuck!

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.640
Okay. Listen.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.600
I'm gonna trust you.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.720
Yes.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.000
But if either of you guys
try anything...

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.440
yeah?

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.560
Yeah?

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.800
Yeah.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.840
Can I sit up?

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.120
Yeah.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.560
Slow.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.240
Get up slow.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.120
Who are you?

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.640
My name's Henry.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.280
That's my brother, Sam.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.720
I'm the most wanted man
in Kansas City.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.680
Although right now...

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.400
my guess is you're running
a close second.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.520
- Where'd you get these?
- From Bill.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.720
He's dead.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.760
He says thank you.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.520
I'm guessing you don't have much,
so this means a lot.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.320
How old is he?

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.960
- He's eight.
- Cool.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.760
I'm Ellie.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.080
I'm Joel. Look, you ate,
we didn't kill each other

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.200
let's call this a win-win
and move on.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.000
Well, I'm betting

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.400
that y'all came up here

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.680
to get a view of the city
and plan a way out.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.800
And when the sun's up

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.880
I'll show you one.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.400
Welcome to Killa City.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880
No FEDRA.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.320
Not as of ten days ago, no.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.680
- We always heard KC FEDRA was...
- Monsters? Savages?

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.760
Yeah, you heard right.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.320
Raped and tortured and
murdered people for 20 years.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.560
And you know what happens
when you do that to people?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.600
The moment they get a chance,
they do it right back to you.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.160
But you're not FEDRA.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.440
No, worse.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.400
I'm a collaborator.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.880
- I don't work with rats.
- Yeah, you fucking do.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.200
Today you do

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.560
because I live here and you don't.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.960
That's how I followed you here.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.880
I know this city, and that's how
I'm gonna help you get out.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.840
Why help us?

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.480
I saw what you did.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.360
The way you killed those men.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.240
Now, I know where to go

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.240
but I don't know
how to make it through alive.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.496
- Not if it's just me and Sam.
- You seem capable enough.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.600
- You're armed.
- You're wrong, and wrong.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.760
Never killed anyone.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.896
And pointing an unloaded gun at you

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.200
was the closest I've ever come
to being violent.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.560
So that's the deal.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.920
I show the way.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.960
You clear the way.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.000
Haven't heard that in a long time.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.480
So how are we getting out?

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.720
Highways, downtown.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.400
Us.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.560
This whole area belongs to Kathleen.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.800
She's in charge?

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.360
Leader of the resistance.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.200
You can see the way
we're bounded by highways.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.760
They got people posted all around
the inside perimeter.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.560
If we get close, we get caught.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.680
No question.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.280
So how do we get across?

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.440
Kansas City has a subway?

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.800
No, but they do have
maintenance tunnels.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.360
There's a bunch of buildings
all put up by the same developers.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.160
And they share these tunnels,
including...

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.440
a bank building here.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.080
So we enter the tunnels here

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.680
travel underground and pop up here.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.720
Westside North. Residential.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.856
There's an embankment
on the other side of the houses.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.040
We head down

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.680
pedestrian bridge over the river

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.440
free as a bird.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.920
You're right. It's a great plan.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.600
So, what do you need me for?

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.320
You noticed anything strange
about this city?

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.496
I mean, other than the strange shit
you've already seen?

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.680
- No Infected?
- Oh, there's Infected.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.280
Just not on the surface.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.480
FEDRA drove them underground
15 years ago

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.200
and never let them come back up.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.016
It's the only good thing
those fascist motherfuckers ever did.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.520
So you want us going into a tunnel?

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.000
Everyone thinks
that it's full of Infected

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.096
including Kathleen,
which means that we're not gonna be

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.800
running into any of her people.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.520
But you see, what I know is

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.560
it's empty.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.880
You've been down there?

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.720
No, but the FEDRA guy
that I worked with

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.120
told me that it's clean,
completely clean.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.160
- They cleared it out. All of it.
- When?

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.640
Like, three years ago.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.360
Okay, maybe, there's one or two

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.440
- but you handle it.
- What if there's more?

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.376
Or one of those blind ones
that sees like a bat?

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.200
Wait, you ran into a Clicker?

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.120
- Two of them.
- And you're still alive.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.880
You see?

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.080
You're the right people.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.440
If it gets bad down there,
we turn around

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.776
and run right back out
the same way we came.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.800
That's your great plan?

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.000
No, that's my dicey-as-fuck plan.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.200
But as far as I could tell

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.240
it's our only shot.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.200
They're saying
they're going to help us escape.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.080
Right?

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.240
We need to get out of sight.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.280
I think it's this way.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.680
This should be it.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.040
You ready?

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.400
Get your gun out.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.280
See? It's empty.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.800
The plan is good.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.480
"The plan is good"?

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.960
We've been down here two seconds.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.400
We don't know anything.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.336
Your dad's kind of a pessimist.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.840
- He's not my dad.
- I'm not her dad.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.560
Just point your light forward

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.960
and be ready to run.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.520
No.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.480
I heard about places like this.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.920
People went underground
after Outbreak Day.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.240
Built settlements.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.440
What happened to them?

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.200
Maybe they didn't follow the rules
and they all got infected.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.400
No way! I love these.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.440
I have issues...

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.280
4, 5, 6, 11.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.120
So cool.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.960
"To the edge of the universe

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.000
and back.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.840
Endure and survive."

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.840
Endure.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.520
Survive.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.760
Endure. Survive.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.560
Fuck yeah, man!

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.600
Keep it down. We're not out yet.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.080
Oh, c'mon. Can we just
rest here for a while?

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.000
There's, like, actually
shit to do here.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.920
Wouldn't be so bad
to wait the light out a bit.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.480
Safer in shadows when we pop
back out on the other side.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.360
Yes! Come on! Yeah!

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.240
Come on. Pass it back.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.880
Yeah!

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.040
Okay.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.400
If you were...

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.880
collaboratin' to take care of him

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.520
I shouldn't have said what I said.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.160
I don't know your situation.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.960
And I'm not sayin'
they should let it go, but...

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.080
All things considered,
seems kinda cruel...

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.240
to send a whole army
after you for that.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.320
You know, I wasn't...

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.040
exactly telling you the truth before

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.160
about me not killing someone.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.400
There was a man, a great man.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.560
You know, he was never afraid

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.240
never selfish

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.840
and he was always forgiving.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.440
Have you ever met someone like that?

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.600
Kind of man you'd follow anywhere.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.920
I mean, I wanted to.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.080
Well, I would've.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.400
Yeah, but...

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.360
Sam, he...

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.400
he got sick.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.080
Leukemia.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.840
Yeah, anyway...

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.760
there was one drug that worked

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.240
and, whoa, big shock.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.880
There wasn't much left of it

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.680
and it belonged to FEDRA.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.600
And if I wanted some

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.040
it was gonna take something big.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.600
So I gave them something big.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.600
That one great man.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.880
The leader of the resistance
movement in Kansas City.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.840
And Kathleen's brother.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.880
Yeah, so...

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.920
you still think they should
take it easy on me?

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.360
Or am I the bad guy?

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.680
I don't know
what you're waitin' on, man.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.280
The answer's easy.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.240
I am the bad guy
because I did a bad guy thing.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.160
But you get it, though.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.800
You might not be her father

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.440
but you were someone's.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.760
See, I could tell.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.760
Yeah, where'd he go?

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.480
We've waited long enough.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.840
- And?
- We haven't found 'em yet.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.600
What about the man who killed Bryan?

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.000
Well...

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.400
we're not doin' so good.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.440
Who told you I was here?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.560
Your mom.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.320
Why are you talking to my mom?

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.200
We didn't know where you were.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.880
Have you been back to the room
you grew up in?

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.440
No. Fuck no.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.000
It's a couple hundred miles away.
It's not exactly worth it.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.480
Right.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.760
When Michael and I were little

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.000
this room seemed so big.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.520
I was really scared of thunder.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.680
So when there was a storm...

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.760
Michael told me
that this wasn't a room at all.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.360
That this was actually

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.520
just a big, wooden box.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.600
A big, wooden box
that nothing could get inside of.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.360
And it didn't matter
if there was lightning

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.560
or tornadoes or gunfire.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.040
He said as long as we were together

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.560
in our perfect box...

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.920
we would be safe.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.520
He did that for me.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.240
And he did stuff like that
all the time.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.960
He was so beautiful.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.960
I'm not.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.280
I never was.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.760
He would be horrified by
the things I've done.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.920
And if you've come to tell me

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.600
that Michael wouldn't want me
to hurt Henry

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.800
that he would want me to forgive...

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.720
I know that too.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.000
He told me.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.480
The last time
I saw him alive in jail...

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.800
he told me to forgive.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.880
And what did he get for that?

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.240
Where is the justice in that?

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.160
What is the point of that?

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.480
Your brother was a great man.
We all loved him.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.360
But...

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.880
he didn't change anything.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.920
You did.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.440
We're with you.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.200
Good.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.800
- Do you know where we are?
- Yep.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.800
The other side.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.600
No one is here.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.760
No one's gonna be here,
because my plan worked.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.560
So much goddamn talkin'.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.840
I'm just saying, I delivered.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.680
Make this right, go down the street

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.640
embankment behind the last house...

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.600
and we're out.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.560
So we cross the river and then what?
Where ya gonna go?

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.640
- Don't know yet.
- Well, we're goin' to Wyoming.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.880
What? It's a huge state.
It can fit two more people.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.120
Yeah.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.880
Maybe we just call this one a success
and say our fond farewells.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.400
No, he'll change his mind.
Trust me. This is how it goes.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.320
He's like, "No, Ellie.
Never, ever, ever happening."

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.200
And then I'm like, "I'm gonna
ask you a million more times."

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.120
And he's like... Fuck!

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.880
Move... move!

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.280
Go!

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.760
- The fuck is that comin' from?
- Shut up.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.840
Shit. All right, fuck.
Let's move. Let's go.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.456
- What are you doin'?
- Gettin' the fuck outta here!

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.560
Oh shit...

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.880
What do we do?

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.680
All right.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.680
- Stay here.
- What?

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.200
If you don't move,
he's not gonna hit you.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.600
I'm gonna go around

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.936
try to get in the house
through the back

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.536
- and then I'll take him out.
- But if you go out there

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.496
- he's gonna kill you.
- It's dark and he has shit aim.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.760
- Nobody's gonna kill me.
- Then he's gonna kill us.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.480
Do you trust me?

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.360
Put the gun down, slide it over to me

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.720
and then stay up here
for another hour.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.120
That's all you have to do.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.080
Please don't do it.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.840
Please.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.200
Anthony? Anthony?

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.360
Anthony, hold them where they are.
We're almost there.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.720
Fuck.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.520
Run!

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.560
Run!

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.120
Run!

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.720
There's cars everywhere.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.280
Why do you think you're in front?
Clear them.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.640
Go... go!

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.320
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.440
- He's up there.
- Fuck.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.960
Two and two!
Around the back, take him out!

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.440
Dead end, Henry.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.160
Gonna step on out?
Save us some time?

00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.800
No?

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.520
That's all right, it doesn't matter.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.640
I'll come out!

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.600
Just let the kids go!

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.320
No.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.920
Sorry.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.160
The girl is with the man
who killed Bryan.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.800
And Sam...

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.440
- Well, Sam's with you.
- You don't understand!

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.800
But I do.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.880
I know why you did what you did.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.440
But did you ever stop to think
that maybe he was supposed to die?

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.120
He's just a fucking kid!

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.720
Well, kids die, Henry.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.720
They die all the time.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.000
You think the whole world
revolves around him?

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.800
That he's worth...

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.760
everything?

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.600
Well, this is what happens
when you fuck with fate.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.720
Get ready to take him and run. Yes!

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.800
Do it.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.000
It's time, Henry.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.440
Enough!

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.200
Okay.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.680
It ends the way it ends.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.840
No!

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.760
Run 'em down...!

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.040
Run. Find cover.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.440
Don't look back.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.840
Run!

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.680
Help! Get the fuck away!

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.120
Get the fuck off me!

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.160
No! Sam!

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.360
Sam!

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.240
Come on... come on!

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.400
Go... go!

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.600
Stop!

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.880
This way now! Move!

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.640
"As the Raven 01
approaches the red planet..."

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.480
You think they'll be okay?

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.360
Yeah, I think.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.400
It's easier when you're a kid anyway.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.640
You don't have anybody else
relying on you.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.440
That's the hard part.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.160
Well...

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.480
I guess we're doing a good job then.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.480
What's that comic book say?

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.520
- "Endure and survive"?
- "Endure and survive."

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.600
- That shit's redundant.
- Yeah, it's not great.

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.920
No.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.880
Look, I don't know exactly
how I'm gettin' to Wyoming.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.520
I'm probably walkin'.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.360
But...

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.680
- you know, if you want to...
- Yeah.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.640
Yeah.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.920
Yeah, I think it'd be nice
for Sam to have a friend.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.440
I'll tell him in the morning.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.520
New day, new start.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.600
"Bingo!"

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.200
"Should we knock?"

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.640
Hey.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.920
"I don't see any weird movements.
Stiff? Negative."

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.440
"Damage here in Sector 153.
Stella, can you hear me?"

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.920
"I read you."

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.560
Okay, from here.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.400
Do I not look scared?

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.480
"Never."

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.280
I'm scared all the time...

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.600
of scorpions!

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.080
Fuck.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.640
My blood...

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.760
is medicine.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.560
I promise.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.120
Promise.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.960
Hey.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.240
- Nope...
- Joel!

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.160
Joel!

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.880
Ellie.

00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.920
Are you okay?

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.560
Easy...

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.600
Henry, give me the gun.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.160
Henry, give me the gun.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.680
What did I do?

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.600
What did I do?

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.440
What... what did I do?

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.320
- Sam?
- Henry, give me the gun.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.160
Give me the gun.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:23.160
Give me the gun, Henry.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.280
- Give me the gun.
- Shit...

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:26.920
Henry, no!

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.720
Oh, god...

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.800
Which way's west?

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.040
Let's go.
