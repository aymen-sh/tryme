WEBVTT

00:05.510 --> 00:07.640
We finally made it!

00:10.940 --> 00:13.880
The Americas!

00:22.350 --> 00:25.170
It was such a long trip!

00:25.170 --> 00:27.170
At long last...

00:27.170 --> 00:31.710
Land!

00:28.710 --> 00:31.710
Meat!

00:35.800 --> 00:40.390
We didn't get to eat much 
meat while we were at sea.

00:44.970 --> 00:51.400
The battle team may be in need of 
animal protein after all that training.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.040
That's right!

00:55.040 --> 00:58.480
We might be able to hunt wild 
animals once we're ashore!

00:58.480 --> 01:00.780
What kind of animals are 
there in the Americas?

01:00.780 --> 01:03.640
I've never traveled abroad before!

01:04.710 --> 01:07.910
This wasn't exactly the 
vacation I had in mind!

01:07.910 --> 01:09.410
Vacation...

01:11.320 --> 01:15.260
Meathead here may have 
the right idea, though.

01:19.390 --> 01:21.970
Look. Past the fog.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.250
Of course.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.550
We knew it would be like this.

02:02.550 --> 02:06.850
Then again, this is our first 
time overseas in this new world.

02:06.850 --> 02:10.480
We didn't know how the world was going to be.

02:11.740 --> 02:15.770
Who knows? The Fake Lilian 
story might have been true.

02:15.770 --> 02:18.100
Maybe it was just Japan 
that was still petrified.

02:18.860 --> 02:22.020
Maybe the world had already 
gotten back to normal.

02:22.020 --> 02:26.520
Or maybe they'd fought off the 
petrification beam right from the start.

02:27.710 --> 02:30.510
Somewhere deep down, we thought, maybe...

02:30.920 --> 02:34.580
Just maybe! You know?

02:46.340 --> 02:48.060
Look at that cape.

02:48.470 --> 02:51.380
There's a giant clump of statues there.

02:52.450 --> 02:53.520
You're right.

02:54.230 --> 02:55.520
Why?

02:56.770 --> 02:58.990
Probably a huge car crash.

03:00.450 --> 03:05.660
All the cars must have withered away, 
leaving only the statues behind.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.630
We're on water.

03:08.630 --> 03:10.080
Why would there be cars here?

03:12.050 --> 03:14.040
In fact, this place was filled with cars.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.280
I passed by here on my own boat.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.570
Several thousand years ago,

03:21.630 --> 03:26.040
this was the gate to the Pacific.

03:26.600 --> 03:32.280
The beautiful, red Golden Gate Bridge, 
shining amid the San Francisco fog.

03:34.830 --> 03:38.080
It really is all gone.

03:38.530 --> 03:40.530
Everything humanity built is gone.

03:41.200 --> 03:46.500
Part of me was still hoping 
they'd help us out.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.170
Y-Yeah...

03:48.170 --> 03:49.190
Nope.

03:49.570 --> 03:51.080
That's not it, guys.

03:51.910 --> 03:54.310
Once we get and raise corn,

03:54.310 --> 03:59.840
the power of science will help us revive 
all the statues around the world!

04:00.500 --> 04:01.670
Yeah.

04:02.670 --> 04:05.200
We're the ones going to help them.

04:06.450 --> 04:10.300
All 7.8 billion people.

05:41.980 --> 05:46.990
<b>Light Trap in the Darkness</b>

05:53.190 --> 05:54.250
Finally!

05:54.250 --> 05:55.670
We're in the US!

05:56.120 --> 05:59.170
Landfall!

06:01.300 --> 06:04.880
Lilian's homeland.

06:06.260 --> 06:08.310
So this is America!

06:08.310 --> 06:12.270
I've heard a lot about it, so I've been 
wondering what it's really like... but...

06:14.170 --> 06:17.020
It doesn't look much different from Japan.

06:18.310 --> 06:20.270
It's just a forest.

06:24.570 --> 06:27.830
I guess all the distinctly 
American landmarks are all gone.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.410
Of course it isn't recognizable.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.410
It's a pine cone!

06:35.980 --> 06:38.680
I-It's way huge!

06:39.580 --> 06:41.630
That's a sequoia.

06:41.630 --> 06:43.670
Sequoia?

06:44.930 --> 06:46.260
This guy.

06:47.230 --> 06:50.100
Holy crap, it's enormous!

06:51.250 --> 06:57.770
I've seen plenty of forests, 
but I've never seen such a huge tree!

06:58.050 --> 07:02.050
Sequoias get over 80 meters tall.

07:02.050 --> 07:04.920
They're ridiculously huge. 
The biggest on Earth, in fact.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.780
E-Eighty meters?!

07:14.780 --> 07:19.370
Even after civilization's fall, 
the world operates on its own scale.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.960
Damn, America...

07:28.800 --> 07:31.430
We'll split into two teams 
here at the Sacramento River.

07:31.930 --> 07:34.750
The resource acquisition team 
will remain on the ship,

07:34.750 --> 07:37.970
and the corn scout team 
will head toward the interior.

07:38.510 --> 07:42.060
I assume the battle team will 
be escorting the scout team

07:42.060 --> 07:43.920
to deal with any wild animal encounters.

08:00.580 --> 08:04.750
Let's get this corn search started! 
No stone unturned!

08:04.750 --> 08:07.570
Yeah, that's not happening.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.760
You have no idea how big the US is.

08:09.760 --> 08:16.860
We aren't even sure America's beloved 
corn hasn't already hybridized.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.380
There's a region called the Corn Belt.

08:19.380 --> 08:22.140
If there's still corn around, 
that's where we'll likely find it.

08:23.220 --> 08:26.580
On the west coast, our best 
bet is northern California.

08:30.390 --> 08:35.260
We'll go through San Francisco Bay to 
the Sacramento River and the City area.

08:35.260 --> 08:37.420
Wait, wait, Senku-chan.

08:37.420 --> 08:42.040
Most people don't know American geography.

08:42.630 --> 08:46.710
Okay, well, point is, we should 
find corn up this river, right?

08:46.930 --> 08:48.320
Let's get moving!

08:48.680 --> 08:52.810
Chrome-chan's so quick to find 
optimism in new situations.

08:52.810 --> 08:54.960
That's why you're our exploration leader.

09:00.260 --> 09:02.170
Fall is almost over.

09:02.170 --> 09:05.040
We're at the end of corn season.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.770
Let's hope we made it in time.

09:07.170 --> 09:09.270
Yeah, that won't be an issue.

09:10.260 --> 09:13.080
The planet goes through a 
thing called precession.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.290
It's the same thing as how 
a top teeters as it spins.

09:15.840 --> 09:21.160
<b>Precession</b>

09:16.690 --> 09:22.990
Luckily for us, thanks to the planet's axis 
moving slightly over the past 3,700 years,

09:22.990 --> 09:26.250
the climate is offset by about nine days.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.880
So we just barely made it!

09:30.480 --> 09:31.950
What has me more worried

09:31.950 --> 09:35.790
is the subtle ecological changes as 
a result of the change in climate.

09:35.790 --> 09:39.510
We'd better hope we don't get 
attacked by any big creatures.

09:40.010 --> 09:43.750
I'd enjoy it if we did get 
attacked by a big creature.

09:44.570 --> 09:45.600
Yeah.

09:47.990 --> 09:50.150
Wait, what? Isn't it the opposite?

09:58.990 --> 10:01.700
There you go jinxing it again, Senku-chan!

10:01.700 --> 10:04.800
I get it now, though... Seriously...

10:05.330 --> 10:07.340
It's not bad luck or anything!

10:07.340 --> 10:09.260
There's no such thing as luck!

10:09.260 --> 10:10.630
Science man Senku is just

10:10.630 --> 10:15.090
telling us the worst-case scenario 
because he knows it'll happen!

10:18.930 --> 10:20.900
It's a float of American crocodiles!

10:23.100 --> 10:25.890
There's so freaking many of them!

10:38.130 --> 10:39.110
Meat!

10:39.110 --> 10:40.250
Meat!

10:40.250 --> 10:41.410
Meat!

10:43.320 --> 10:45.030
Meat!

10:45.030 --> 10:46.500
Meat!

10:46.500 --> 10:48.490
So that's what this is about!

10:48.490 --> 10:50.910
That's why you were hoping we'd get attacked!

10:50.910 --> 10:52.860
Meat!

10:54.490 --> 10:57.910
I'm grateful to the circle of life.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.390
Well, this is something.

11:03.640 --> 11:08.350
The almighty all-stars!

11:32.380 --> 11:34.500
We're in the US, which means...

11:35.450 --> 11:38.510
We aren't leaving before we have some of this.

12:00.750 --> 12:02.580
Please enjoy.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.780
Crocodile burgers.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.040
Hamburgers!

12:09.260 --> 12:11.400
Hamburgers?

12:11.860 --> 12:14.670
You eat them like this.

12:25.740 --> 12:28.850
It's so tasty!

12:31.850 --> 12:34.520
Damn, it's so good!

12:34.520 --> 12:37.020
How is it so juicy?!

12:37.020 --> 12:39.230
I've never had anything like it!

12:59.540 --> 13:00.340
Senku.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.060
One of the crocodiles had swallowed this.

13:06.650 --> 13:08.290
Is there something inside it?

13:18.930 --> 13:20.060
Corn!

13:23.410 --> 13:26.330
This is the fabled American corn?

13:27.770 --> 13:29.660
Landed right in our hands.

13:30.150 --> 13:34.230
We've found the key to reviving 
all of humanity upstream!

13:38.510 --> 13:40.920
This is the life-giving corn!

13:40.920 --> 13:42.150
Yup.

13:42.150 --> 13:45.290
The OP corn crop of the Americas.

13:45.290 --> 13:47.640
The great Yellow Dent.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.620
OP crop...

13:50.570 --> 13:52.400
It tastes like ass, though.

13:52.400 --> 13:56.310
But we can get alcohol out 
of it insanely efficiently.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.960
Which means we're finally 
reviving the whole world!

14:01.960 --> 14:03.190
Hang on!

14:03.190 --> 14:06.950
We're almost there, statues of America!

14:07.280 --> 14:11.130
Although I have no idea how 
much of this corn is left.

14:11.130 --> 14:12.010
All good.

14:12.010 --> 14:15.460
We only need a little, 
and we can grow a ton more.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.990
It'll be a race against time either way.

14:18.710 --> 14:23.240
We need to face our enemy 
before they get to us first.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.090
To face Why-Man!

14:25.090 --> 14:26.180
Yup.

14:26.180 --> 14:29.550
We're gonna get right to 
work making Corn City!

14:35.270 --> 14:37.180
Corn grains!

14:38.410 --> 14:40.690
They're flowing down the 
river one after another.

14:42.070 --> 14:44.020
H-Hyoga-sama...

14:45.960 --> 14:48.990
We can be sure they're growing up ahead.

14:48.990 --> 14:51.570
There's got to be a crap ton!

14:54.950 --> 15:00.230
Does corn really drift conveniently 
down the river, though?

15:03.300 --> 15:06.190
Hello. <i>Perseus</i> here.

15:06.190 --> 15:09.110
<i>Heya. Scout team here.</i>

15:09.110 --> 15:11.700
<i>We found corn on the river.</i>

15:13.810 --> 15:16.900
We haven't actually found it growing.

15:16.900 --> 15:18.580
We need information.

15:18.580 --> 15:23.100
So let us know if you find 
any floating downstream.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.610
<i>Okay, roger.</i>

15:24.830 --> 15:26.560
You heard them, boys!

15:26.560 --> 15:30.190
Keep your eyes peeled! 
Don't miss a single thing!

15:32.340 --> 15:33.530
All right!

15:33.530 --> 15:35.220
Let's do this!

16:33.610 --> 16:34.800
It's around here.

16:35.020 --> 16:38.880
You mentioned a bunch of 
confusing place names earlier.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.790
The Sacramento City area, was it?

16:49.240 --> 16:51.900
What are you making in 
such a hurry, Senku-chan?

16:53.490 --> 16:56.250
A white cloth over the light?

17:00.090 --> 17:03.130
You'll attract bugs with 
such a bright light at night.

17:03.130 --> 17:05.400
That's the whole point.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.000
It's a light trap.

17:08.340 --> 17:13.480
We can tell what's in the area from whether 
or not we attract phototactic bugs.

17:14.230 --> 17:16.560
If I'm right about this...

17:33.780 --> 17:36.450
European corn borers.

17:36.450 --> 17:38.740
These moths thrive on corn.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.380
There's a boatload of corn nearby.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.430
Butterflies, huh? They're beautiful.

17:46.430 --> 17:47.920
Nah, they're moths.

17:48.220 --> 17:51.920
Butterflies are moths. 
We humans just gave them a different name.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.050
They have a mystical beauty about them, huh?

17:57.440 --> 17:58.690
Kohaku...

17:58.690 --> 18:00.710
Actually, everyone from the village...

18:01.150 --> 18:05.090
Have you guys ever even 
seen this kind of moth?

18:07.290 --> 18:10.090
Now that you mention it, 
I've never seen it before.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.770
I've never even thought about 
different kinds of moths.

18:13.010 --> 18:16.200
These guys eat cloth more 
than they do grains.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.780
In other words, their numbers 
should have dwindled

18:19.780 --> 18:22.530
quite a bit since the humans vanished.

18:23.230 --> 18:28.370
How did we end up with so 
many in so little time?

18:28.370 --> 18:31.710
It almost makes me wonder if 
there's a giant corn farm nearby.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.760
What's up, Senku? You look so serious.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.760
We're reviving all of humanity.

18:37.760 --> 18:41.090
What more could you hope 
for than plenty of corn?

18:50.080 --> 18:51.210
I sense...

19:06.580 --> 19:07.640
Bloodlust!

19:08.720 --> 19:09.710
What is it?

19:09.710 --> 19:11.160
A beast of some sort?

19:11.160 --> 19:14.460
Nothing to worry about with our elite group!

19:14.460 --> 19:16.470
It's not convincing when 
you say it while hiding.

19:16.470 --> 19:19.260
Do you recognize its ki?

19:19.530 --> 19:22.260
No, there's no such thing as ki.

19:22.570 --> 19:27.340
Though I do think we're perceiving 
adrenaline byproducts and such.

19:27.990 --> 19:30.520
Not that I can really say.

19:32.070 --> 19:33.260
<i>Think...</i>

19:37.310 --> 19:39.560
<i>I vowed to protect them.</i>

19:42.860 --> 19:45.870
<i>This faint scent on the air...</i>

19:49.880 --> 19:51.190
<i>Gun smoke?!</i>

19:51.780 --> 19:53.490
<i>From a used firearm?!</i>

19:53.960 --> 19:57.810
The enemy is indeed proper.

20:00.830 --> 20:07.060
It seems we were the ones who 
were attracted to the light trap.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.650
All hands, to the boat!

20:37.530 --> 20:38.380
Machine gun!

20:39.350 --> 20:40.800
What the heck is that?!

20:44.910 --> 20:48.240
Don't underestimate a sailor's maneuvering!

20:51.630 --> 20:53.320
Water barrier!

21:14.330 --> 21:16.400
Why did they find out?

21:20.140 --> 21:24.080
We're saved thanks to 
Tsukasa's superhuman senses.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.430
Are you all relatively safe?

21:26.430 --> 21:27.880
How?

21:27.880 --> 21:30.090
Who would have a machine gun?

21:30.510 --> 21:33.010
I thought there were no more humans left.

21:33.010 --> 21:35.980
So the US was spared?

21:35.980 --> 21:37.390
That can't be it.

21:37.390 --> 21:40.110
It wouldn't explain why those 
statues were left there.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.720
The only possibility...

21:43.220 --> 21:46.320
is that someone revived 
on their own, like Senku.

21:49.970 --> 21:51.970
And they're growing corn.

21:53.130 --> 21:57.380
That would be hella fortunate.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.990
In the worst case, we're going 
to have a proper science duel

22:01.990 --> 22:03.610
with a science user on the Dark Side.

22:05.330 --> 22:09.070
We're gonna have to win that fight.

22:10.820 --> 22:13.580
This is stupid exhilarating!

23:52.030 --> 23:54.990
