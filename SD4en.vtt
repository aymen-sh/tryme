<b>Check out the haul I got from the girls
in the Assassins department.</b>

13:19.670 --> 13:21.090
<b>Who's he?</b>

13:21.170 --> 13:22.960
<b>-No clue.
-What?!</b>

13:25.170 --> 13:27.300
<b>If you want more chocolate,
you can eat those.</b>

13:28.340 --> 13:31.220
<b>I had to turn down

13:31.310 --> 13:33.020
<b>Get out of the way!</b>

13:41.020 --> 13:43.940
<b>I thought we were alike,</b>

13:44.570 --> 13:47.570
<b>but he wasn't hard-boiled at all.</b>

13:47.660 --> 13:49.870
<b><i>Wait, that's his beef with Sakamoto?</i></b>

13:49.950 --> 13:51.780
<b>I see.</b>

13:51.870 --> 13:55.910
<b>Well, now you'll get to settle
an old score.</b>

13:56.000 --> 13:56.830
<b>It gives me chi--</b>

13:56.910 --> 13:57.750
<b>No!</b>

13:58.710 --> 14:00.330
<b>I don't even care anymore.</b>

14:00.420 --> 14:03.250
<b><i>Is he acting tough? What a cutie.</i></b>

14:07.510 --> 14:10.220
<b>How many of them are hiding in here?</b>

14:10.300 --> 14:12.140
<b>Human resources went all out.</b>

14:14.010 --> 14:16.430
<b>I want to go home.</b>

14:16.520 --> 14:18.940
<b>So many zombies! This is awesome!</b>

14:19.020 --> 14:21.230
<b>I wonder what the next one will be like.</b>

14:21.770 --> 14:24.190
<b>That girl's a real Sakamoto!</b>

14:24.280 --> 14:26.400
<b>She's got nerves of steel, unlike you.</b>

14:27.280 --> 14:29.240
<b>Shut up.</b>

14:29.320 --> 14:30.450
<b>I'll show you.</b>

14:31.120 --> 14:33.490
<b>Seriously, what's in that thing?</b>

15:38.140 --> 15:39.520
<b>I don't.</b>

15:39.600 --> 15:41.060
<b>Where's my family?</b>

<b>Who are you--</b>

16:17.810 --> 16:19.350
<b>Bring it on, you old hag.</b>

16:19.430 --> 16:23.270
<b>Lemme show you what my family's

<b>Oh, my.</b>

16:28.570 --> 16:31.190
<b>This one's feisty, isn't she?</b>

16:31.780 --> 16:33.740
<b>It gives me chills.</b>

16:36.160 --> 16:40.080
<b>You really don't remember me, Sakamoto?</b>

16:40.160 --> 16:41.620
<b>I told you I don't.</b>

16:43.210 --> 16:44.790
<b>Where's my family?</b>

16:45.500 --> 16:47.250
<b>I'll tell you this.</b>

<b>Boom.</b>

17:22.410 --> 17:23.540
<b>This is sad to see,</b>

17:25.000 --> 17:26.170
<b>Sakamoto.</b>

17:32.340 --> 17:34.090
<b>Party's getting started.</b>

17:35.550 --> 17:37.890
<b>What're you looking at, hag?</b>

17:40.350 --> 17:42.260
<b>You're not bad.</b>

17:43.310 --> 17:46.980
<b>That was a good punch. No wasted tension.</b>

<b>Oops?</b>

17:48.690 --> 17:49.860
<b>But…</b>

<b>Lu!</b>

<b>if I actually cared,</b>

18:01.030 --> 18:03.910
<b>you'd both be dead in a second.</b>

18:04.620 --> 18:07.660
<b>But that doesn't give me chills, you see?</b>

18:07.750 --> 18:09.460
<b>So…</b>

18:12.290 --> 18:14.880
<b>Let go of me! Hey!</b>

18:14.960 --> 18:17.930
<b>I wanna see what you can really do.</b>

<b>In my experience,</b>

18:48.250 --> 18:50.620
<b>There's no way I can do that!</b>

<b>I'm sorry, Shin.</b>

<b><i>She's an emotional drunk?</i></b>

<b>It's been five years since you retired.</b>

19:07.310 --> 19:08.770
<b>Get it, Sakamoto?</b>

19:09.480 --> 19:11.730
<b>This is the difference of five years.</b>

19:12.350 --> 19:14.310
<b>The difference between you and me.</b>

19:15.650 --> 19:16.980
<b>It's sad to see.</b>

19:17.070 --> 19:20.700
<b>You used to be such a hard-boiled guy.</b>

<b>There's nothing you can do.</b>

19:45.720 --> 19:48.890
<b><i>Look at this, Sakamoto! Nagumo!</i></b>

19:49.890 --> 19:52.190
<b>I put dynamite in here</b>

<b>Sure, interesting.</b>

<b>That gives me an idea. Super Ball!</b>
