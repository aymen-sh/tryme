00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
<b>Father will be home soon.</b>

00:16.550 --> 00:19.510
<b>Okay, my rough notes have been burned.</b>

00:25.650 --> 00:28.020
<b>The revised documents are in here.</b>

00:30.070 --> 00:32.570
<b>Good. It's almost full.</b>

00:35.160 --> 00:37.280
<b>I'm home, Rafal!</b>

00:41.490 --> 00:42.580
<b>He's not here?</b>

00:46.960 --> 00:50.210
<b>Huh? What could he have burned?</b>

00:59.220 --> 01:00.850
<b>Th-This is…</b>

01:01.930 --> 01:03.100
<b>It can't be.</b>

01:08.940 --> 01:10.730
<b>As expected,</b>

01:11.610 --> 01:14.150
<b>proving heliocentrism won't be easy.</b>

01:14.650 --> 01:18.320
<b>The orbits I've calculated
are still far from perfect circles.</b>

01:20.200 --> 01:23.660
<b>At this rate, the geocentric model
is still more accurate.</b>

01:24.160 --> 01:25.620
<b>-Hello there.
-Huh?</b>

01:26.960 --> 01:29.540
<b>-We met the other day.
-Oh!</b>

01:29.630 --> 01:31.460
<b>G-Good afternoon.</b>

01:31.540 --> 01:33.800
<b>I'm sorry about all that.</b>

01:33.880 --> 01:36.130
<b>I've heard you're pretty smart.</b>

01:36.630 --> 01:38.840
<b>You're entering university already?</b>

01:38.930 --> 01:40.850
<b>Oh, uh, yes!</b>

01:40.930 --> 01:43.470
<b>I'll begin studying theology
in the next term.</b>

01:43.560 --> 01:45.930
<b>Oh? How impressive.</b>

01:46.020 --> 01:49.980
<b>I'll do my best to contribute to society.</b>

01:50.480 --> 01:51.820
<b>Well then. Farewell.</b>

01:51.900 --> 01:53.150
<b>-Just a second.
-Huh?</b>

01:53.230 --> 01:54.280
<b>That…</b>

01:55.610 --> 01:56.950
<b>Didn't that necklace</b>

01:57.030 --> 01:59.030
<b>belong to Hubert?</b>

01:59.110 --> 02:00.570
<b>Why are you wearing it?</b>

02:03.660 --> 02:05.410
<b>It's a reminder.</b>

02:05.910 --> 02:09.790
<b>A reminder of my anger at his heresy
and the need to remain vigilant.</b>

02:10.920 --> 02:12.130
<b>Is that so?</b>

02:13.920 --> 02:16.880
<b>Do you know what he was researching?</b>

02:17.380 --> 02:19.050
<b>No, not a thing.</b>

02:19.680 --> 02:20.680
<b>I see.</b>

02:21.390 --> 02:24.930
<b>He contradicted geocentrism,</b>

02:25.520 --> 02:27.770
<b>the proper model of the universe.</b>

02:29.270 --> 02:31.400
<b>I'd just like to confirm.</b>

02:31.480 --> 02:34.570
<b>Will you swear to God
that you weren't involved?</b>

02:35.150 --> 02:36.360
<b>Of course. I swear it.</b>

02:36.860 --> 02:39.650
<b>I believe in the universe
that we are taught.</b>

02:44.330 --> 02:46.080
<b>Thanks for your cooperation.</b>

02:46.160 --> 02:47.160
<b>If you'll excuse me.</b>

02:51.120 --> 02:54.670
<b>That freaked me out!
He can't just appear suddenly like that!</b>

02:56.050 --> 02:57.300
<b>Still,</b>

02:57.380 --> 03:00.340
<b>why do they put so much emphasis on words?</b>

03:05.430 --> 03:06.260
<b>Huh?</b>

03:08.600 --> 03:10.850
<b>It didn't burn?</b>

03:10.940 --> 03:13.020
<b>But why is it on my desk?</b>

03:13.860 --> 03:15.520
<b>Don't tell me Father--</b>

03:18.820 --> 03:21.450
<b>My calculations have been revised.</b>

03:22.950 --> 03:25.160
<b>That paper can have trouble burning.</b>

03:26.200 --> 03:29.120
<b>You should watch
until it's completely burnt.</b>

03:29.620 --> 03:33.120
<b>These revisions…
Did you do them, Father?</b>

03:34.330 --> 03:36.340
<b>I know nothing about any of this.</b>

03:41.510 --> 03:44.050
<b>I've been acting too much
in the open lately.</b>

03:44.680 --> 03:48.470
<b>The lack of materials
had stalled my research.</b>

03:49.520 --> 03:51.390
<b>Maybe I should rest awhile</b>

03:51.480 --> 03:54.940
<b>and resume my research
when I've settled at university.</b>

04:38.230 --> 04:40.730
<b>ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH</b>

05:48.550 --> 05:49.430
<b>Rafal!</b>

05:49.510 --> 05:51.720
<b>EPISODE THREE
I… BELIEVE IN HELIOCENTRISM</b>

05:51.800 --> 05:53.510
<b>Is he out?</b>

06:03.520 --> 06:05.440
<b>What have I done?</b>

06:06.320 --> 06:08.530
<b>Why did I revise those calculations?</b>

06:09.780 --> 06:10.820
<b>If…</b>

06:11.410 --> 06:12.950
<b>I were to be caught…</b>

06:18.920 --> 06:20.420
<b>Hi there.</b>

06:20.920 --> 06:22.460
<b>G-Good afternoon.</b>

06:23.920 --> 06:26.800
<b>Sorry for the sudden intrusion.</b>

06:27.300 --> 06:31.800
<b>I'd like to follow up
on a few matters concerning Hubert.</b>

06:32.890 --> 06:35.100
<b>Oh, and could I have some water too?</b>

06:35.600 --> 06:37.310
<b>Huh? Uh, yes.</b>

06:39.520 --> 06:41.900
<b>My, my! That was some commotion.</b>

06:41.980 --> 06:44.900
<b>Hubert was a student of yours, wasn't he?</b>

06:46.280 --> 06:48.860
<b>Even if he was a heretic,
it must be hard on you.</b>

06:48.950 --> 06:50.450
<b>N-No.</b>

06:50.950 --> 06:52.490
<b>I recognize his heresy.</b>

06:52.570 --> 06:53.530
<b>Furthermore,</b>

06:53.620 --> 06:56.910
<b>he was just one of many students
I've had over the years.</b>

06:56.990 --> 06:59.500
<b>I have no special feelings for him.</b>

06:59.580 --> 07:02.380
<b>You have a previous charge
of heresy yourself.</b>

07:03.580 --> 07:07.170
<b>Weren't you also researching
the heliocentric theory?</b>

07:07.840 --> 07:10.300
<b>Th-That was a long time ago.</b>

07:11.050 --> 07:12.590
<b>I've fully recanted.</b>

07:14.640 --> 07:17.850
<b>I've never spoken
with Hubert about research.</b>

07:20.560 --> 07:22.730
<b>I imagine that's true.</b>

07:23.230 --> 07:27.900
<b>It's likely that Hubert looked into
your past research on his own.</b>

07:28.690 --> 07:32.160
<b>And since your recantation,
you've devoted yourself to theology,</b>

07:32.240 --> 07:36.780
<b>taken in orphans, and desperately
tried to improve your reputation.</b>

07:38.290 --> 07:41.370
<b>I'm sure you want to avoid
a second charge of heresy.</b>

07:42.830 --> 07:47.340
<b>Those who betray the faith twice
have the devil in their bones.</b>

07:48.500 --> 07:50.510
<b>For the sake of the heretic too,</b>

07:51.300 --> 07:54.430
<b>we take the strongest measures
to exorcise the evil.</b>

07:55.180 --> 07:57.100
<b>You know what that means, right?</b>

07:59.520 --> 08:03.060
<b>You burn them… alive.</b>

08:04.520 --> 08:05.940
<b>Exactly.</b>

08:06.440 --> 08:09.980
<b>I haven't directly experienced
the suffering they go through,</b>

08:10.490 --> 08:15.910
<b>but there are some who break
their jaws clenching to resist the pain.</b>

08:16.740 --> 08:18.030
<b>How terrifying.</b>

08:20.240 --> 08:25.420
<b>However, the physical pain of the flames
is the least of their worries.</b>

08:26.670 --> 08:29.050
<b>Someone like you will know what I mean.</b>

08:30.760 --> 08:33.630
<b>Their bodies turn to ash.</b>

08:33.720 --> 08:37.180
<b>There is nothing left
to be restored on Judgment Day.</b>

08:39.760 --> 08:43.770
<b>Academics are divided
about what happens next,</b>

08:44.270 --> 08:46.270
<b>but here's what I think.</b>

08:48.190 --> 08:50.440
<b>I think they experience nothingness.</b>

08:50.530 --> 08:55.240
<b>Memories, experiences, consciousness,
the soul, and the afterlife</b>

08:55.740 --> 08:57.280
<b>all turn to nothing.</b>

08:58.530 --> 09:01.290
<b>I sure wouldn't want that fate.</b>

09:03.960 --> 09:04.960
<b>Now then…</b>

09:06.120 --> 09:09.590
<b>Your child is conducting
blasphemous research, isn't he?</b>

09:10.170 --> 09:11.170
<b>What?</b>

09:12.170 --> 09:13.710
<b>I hit the mark, huh?</b>

09:14.550 --> 09:18.550
<b>A heretic that young…
What is the world coming to?</b>

09:19.050 --> 09:21.100
<b>How can you just accuse him?!</b>

09:21.180 --> 09:22.810
<b>Do you have proof?</b>

09:24.430 --> 09:25.430
<b>No.</b>

09:25.520 --> 09:27.100
<b>Not yet anyway.</b>

09:28.020 --> 09:30.190
<b>But you know, Potocki.</b>

09:30.690 --> 09:34.240
<b>If you knew he was
conducting blasphemous research,</b>

09:34.320 --> 09:36.650
<b>and you didn't turn him in,</b>

09:37.280 --> 09:39.240
<b>it would be over for you.</b>

09:40.370 --> 09:43.870
<b>If you know something,
you should tell me soon.</b>

09:43.950 --> 09:45.790
<b>Before I gather the evidence.</b>

09:46.290 --> 09:49.210
<b>Plus, it's only the boy's first offense.</b>

09:50.880 --> 09:53.750
<b>If he recants,
he'll be released immediately.</b>

09:54.260 --> 09:57.430
<b>Turning him in now
would save everyone a lot of pain.</b>

09:59.300 --> 10:00.220
<b>Well,</b>

10:01.180 --> 10:03.350
<b>that's all I have to say.</b>

10:03.850 --> 10:05.680
<b>Sorry to bother you.</b>

10:05.770 --> 10:06.850
<b>You really…</b>

10:09.440 --> 10:12.690
<b>You really won't execute him
for a first offense?</b>

10:13.690 --> 10:15.400
<b>No. Of course not.</b>

10:21.780 --> 10:22.620
<b>Father.</b>

10:24.450 --> 10:26.620
<b>Oh, Rafal.</b>

10:26.700 --> 10:28.120
<b>So you're home.</b>

10:29.120 --> 10:30.250
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

10:31.580 --> 10:32.540
<b>The revisions</b>

10:33.420 --> 10:34.880
<b>to my calculations…</b>

10:34.960 --> 10:35.840
<b>Huh?</b>

10:36.340 --> 10:38.130
<b>-Was it you--
-Rafal.</b>

10:48.100 --> 10:51.350
<b>Do you think you can prove heliocentrism?</b>

11:01.280 --> 11:02.110
<b>Yes.</b>

11:06.370 --> 11:07.370
<b>I see.</b>

11:08.290 --> 11:09.210
<b>Father--</b>

11:09.290 --> 11:12.290
<b>Forgive me. Please go to bed for now.</b>

11:14.250 --> 11:16.670
<b>We'll discuss this further tomorrow.</b>

11:17.340 --> 11:18.210
<b>Please.</b>

11:33.520 --> 11:34.770
<b>Good morning.</b>

11:38.530 --> 11:40.780
<b>I'm sorry, Rafal.</b>

11:41.990 --> 11:44.240
<b>Now then. Shall we depart?</b>

11:47.240 --> 11:50.370
<b>That takes care of the arrangements.</b>

11:50.870 --> 11:53.670
<b>Your torture officially begins tomorrow.</b>

11:54.920 --> 11:56.960
<b>This here is still a prototype.</b>

11:57.750 --> 11:59.880
<b>I call it the Pear of Anguish.</b>

12:00.550 --> 12:02.840
<b>When you wind it,</b>

12:03.760 --> 12:05.180
<b>it opens up like this.</b>

12:06.430 --> 12:08.970
<b>After four turns with this in your mouth,</b>

12:09.060 --> 12:10.390
<b>your cheeks will split,</b>

12:11.140 --> 12:13.270
<b>and you won't speak for a year.</b>

12:14.690 --> 12:17.900
<b>You probably don't know,
but the world is full of tools</b>

12:17.980 --> 12:23.700
<b>that are designed
to inflict pain effectively.</b>

12:24.780 --> 12:27.200
<b>Pain is something no one can escape,</b>

12:27.910 --> 12:31.450
<b>but there are two ways to avoid it.</b>

12:33.290 --> 12:36.290
<b>Recant at your trial tomorrow,</b>

12:36.960 --> 12:39.960
<b>and proclaim you'll never
associate with astronomy again.</b>

12:40.630 --> 12:44.430
<b>Tell us where all your materials
are located and burn them yourself.</b>

12:45.300 --> 12:47.340
<b>Th-That's it?</b>

12:47.430 --> 12:51.560
<b>Yes. Even I prefer not to torture a child.</b>

12:52.890 --> 12:54.730
<b>Oh, and this.</b>

12:55.390 --> 12:56.310
<b>It's yours, right?</b>

12:56.810 --> 12:58.650
<b>Your university admission form.</b>

12:59.150 --> 13:00.940
<b>It's still valid, you know.</b>

13:01.440 --> 13:04.030
<b>You can recommit your life to theology.</b>

13:05.450 --> 13:08.030
<b>The most important choice you make in life</b>

13:08.120 --> 13:09.950
<b>is what to give up.</b>

13:10.450 --> 13:11.870
<b>You're smart, right?</b>

13:11.950 --> 13:13.950
<b>You'll know the right answer.</b>

13:16.370 --> 13:17.750
<b>Until tomorrow.</b>

13:18.250 --> 13:20.290
<b>Let's meet when you're reborn.</b>

13:32.560 --> 13:34.890
<b>Recant and burn my materials.</b>

13:36.520 --> 13:38.480
<b>Well, I guess I can do that.</b>

13:38.980 --> 13:41.270
<b>I've managed to come this far.</b>

13:41.360 --> 13:42.570
<b>This too</b>

13:43.070 --> 13:44.530
<b>will work out somehow.</b>

13:45.190 --> 13:47.030
<b>Recanting is not the end.</b>

13:47.530 --> 13:49.530
<b>Burning my materials is not the end.</b>

13:50.030 --> 13:52.080
<b>Being charged is not the end.</b>

13:53.240 --> 13:55.080
<b>Whether astronomy is prohibited,</b>

13:55.160 --> 13:57.330
<b>or I'm all alone, it's not the end.</b>

13:58.460 --> 13:59.290
<b>It's not</b>

14:00.000 --> 14:01.040
<b>the end.</b>

14:01.880 --> 14:02.880
<b>The end…</b>

14:03.380 --> 14:04.300
<b>The end…</b>

14:07.880 --> 14:10.340
<b>Why am I doing this?</b>

14:11.300 --> 14:13.310
<b>How did I end up here?</b>

14:14.970 --> 14:17.140
<b>If I'd never learned about heliocentrism,</b>

14:17.730 --> 14:19.940
<b>I would never have found myself here.</b>

14:21.110 --> 14:23.020
<b>If not for heliocentrism,</b>

14:23.650 --> 14:25.780
<b>I'd still be considered intelligent.</b>

14:27.240 --> 14:29.360
<b>I'd be celebrated by those around me.</b>

14:29.860 --> 14:31.660
<b>My lifestyle would be comfortable,</b>

14:32.160 --> 14:34.160
<b>my future would be promising,</b>

14:34.660 --> 14:36.700
<b>and my path forward full of hope.</b>

14:38.500 --> 14:40.920
<b>The world would still be easy.</b>

14:43.170 --> 14:45.210
<b>Why did I do this?</b>

14:46.670 --> 14:49.680
<b>What does heliocentrism mean to--</b>

14:57.930 --> 14:59.940
<b>Moon… light?</b>

15:02.150 --> 15:04.520
<b>Hasn't this happened before?</b>

15:05.940 --> 15:07.360
<b>Just like back then,</b>

15:07.860 --> 15:10.610
<b>continuing with astronomy isn't rational.</b>

15:11.450 --> 15:13.030
<b>Just like back then,</b>

15:13.530 --> 15:15.450
<b>the sky is far away.</b>

15:15.950 --> 15:19.870
<b>Not only that,
the window I have now is even smaller.</b>

15:20.960 --> 15:21.790
<b>But…</b>

15:22.460 --> 15:23.380
<b>But why?</b>

15:24.840 --> 15:26.880
<b>Now, more than then,</b>

15:27.670 --> 15:28.670
<b>I can see the sky</b>

15:29.210 --> 15:30.470
<b>clearer than ever.</b>

15:32.380 --> 15:35.430
<b>Was it always this beautiful?</b>

15:44.400 --> 15:47.690
<b>Does the accused confess</b>

15:48.190 --> 15:51.280
<b>to researching the heliocentric theory</b>

15:51.360 --> 15:54.990
<b>that heavenly bodies
revolve around the Sun, rather than Earth?</b>

15:55.700 --> 15:57.490
<b>Yes, I confess.</b>

15:57.580 --> 16:03.500
<b>Were you aware that this theory
contradicts Church doctrine?</b>

16:04.170 --> 16:06.090
<b>Yes, I was.</b>

16:06.590 --> 16:10.630
<b>The Church seeks from the accused
an official recantation,</b>

16:10.710 --> 16:13.180
<b>as well as the disclosure and destruction</b>

16:13.260 --> 16:15.510
<b>of all related documents.</b>

16:16.220 --> 16:17.140
<b>Understood.</b>

16:17.220 --> 16:20.430
<b>In consideration of the accused's
impressive academic record,</b>

16:20.520 --> 16:23.520
<b>the Church is prepared to permit
university admission</b>

16:23.600 --> 16:25.900
<b>if he agrees to our demands.</b>

16:25.980 --> 16:29.650
<b>Will you accept the admission form?</b>

16:31.570 --> 16:32.820
<b>The important thing</b>

16:32.900 --> 16:34.610
<b>is what to give up.</b>

16:35.110 --> 16:36.410
<b>Choose correctly.</b>

16:37.370 --> 16:39.370
<b>They're only words.</b>

16:40.080 --> 16:41.660
<b>This will all work out.</b>

16:49.000 --> 16:51.550
<b>Now, please recant.</b>

16:53.260 --> 16:54.550
<b>I hereby declare</b>

16:55.800 --> 16:57.970
<b>that I believe in heliocentrism.</b>

17:07.900 --> 17:08.770
<b>Why?</b>

17:09.400 --> 17:12.820
<b>You allow prisoners
to drink such fine wine?</b>

17:13.400 --> 17:16.410
<b>It's a special privilege
on the eve of torture.</b>

17:17.160 --> 17:18.320
<b>I see.</b>

17:19.740 --> 17:21.410
<b>Will you drink with me?</b>

17:21.490 --> 17:23.160
<b>It's a shame to do so alone.</b>

17:33.210 --> 17:35.720
<b>Why did you ruin our deal?</b>

17:38.550 --> 17:39.760
<b>It's simple, really.</b>

17:40.260 --> 17:43.810
<b>I thought not burning my materials
would aid heliocentrism.</b>

17:44.310 --> 17:45.560
<b>There's no use.</b>

17:45.640 --> 17:47.350
<b>Don't underestimate torture.</b>

17:47.940 --> 17:51.150
<b>By tomorrow afternoon,
you'll have told us everything.</b>

17:51.650 --> 17:53.480
<b>Your enemy is a resilient one.</b>

17:55.440 --> 17:58.070
<b>The thing you all oppose isn't me.</b>

17:58.660 --> 17:59.870
<b>Nor is it heretics.</b>

18:00.700 --> 18:02.830
<b>It's part imagination</b>

18:02.910 --> 18:04.080
<b>and part curiosity.</b>

18:05.080 --> 18:07.750
<b>In short, it's truth itself.</b>

18:08.830 --> 18:09.830
<b>Truth itself?</b>

18:10.670 --> 18:13.500
<b>It spreads like an epidemic.</b>

18:14.090 --> 18:16.260
<b>Not even the host can control it.</b>

18:16.970 --> 18:21.140
<b>It's not the sort of harmless thing
that can be tamed by an organization.</b>

18:21.720 --> 18:23.680
<b>So you're saying you'll win?</b>

18:24.720 --> 18:26.060
<b>You think that</b>

18:26.560 --> 18:29.230
<b>this is the right answer for your future?</b>

18:30.560 --> 18:32.480
<b>Of course it's the wrong answer.</b>

18:35.980 --> 18:38.860
<b>But a wrong answer
is not a meaningless one.</b>

18:41.280 --> 18:42.240
<b>By the way,</b>

18:43.490 --> 18:45.830
<b>do you know the effects of poppy seeds?</b>

18:46.540 --> 18:47.540
<b>Poppy seeds?</b>

18:48.620 --> 18:49.460
<b>Well…</b>

18:49.540 --> 18:53.250
<b>It's said they were used
in ancient Athens.</b>

18:53.750 --> 18:55.840
<b>If you mix them with poison,</b>

18:56.460 --> 18:59.470
<b>simply put, they allow you
to die without pain.</b>

19:01.800 --> 19:02.680
<b>I happen</b>

19:03.180 --> 19:05.680
<b>to have added some just now.</b>

19:12.230 --> 19:13.060
<b>Damn it!</b>

19:16.360 --> 19:18.860
<b>-Not your cup.
-Huh?</b>

19:19.360 --> 19:21.070
<b>The one who drank it was me.</b>

19:21.160 --> 19:21.990
<b>Huh?</b>

19:22.910 --> 19:23.820
<b>What?!</b>

19:26.160 --> 19:27.830
<b>Y-You're lying.</b>

19:28.410 --> 19:30.000
<b>You…</b>

19:30.710 --> 19:32.330
<b>You're out of your mind!</b>

19:32.420 --> 19:34.420
<b>You intend to die?</b>

19:35.210 --> 19:36.460
<b>I guess.</b>

19:36.960 --> 19:38.710
<b>Don't give me, "I guess"!</b>

19:38.800 --> 19:42.680
<b>Besides, such a choice
violates our teachings!</b>

19:42.760 --> 19:45.470
<b>How far will you go
to humiliate the Church?</b>

19:45.550 --> 19:48.560
<b>A terrifying fate
awaits you in the afterlife!</b>

19:48.640 --> 19:51.100
<b>No one knows what the afterlife is.</b>

19:52.060 --> 19:54.150
<b>To paraphrase Socrates,</b>

19:54.230 --> 19:56.360
<b>no one has experienced death,</b>

19:56.440 --> 19:59.610
<b>yet everyone assumes
it is the greatest evil.</b>

20:01.070 --> 20:02.320
<b>Or as Epicurus said,</b>

20:03.070 --> 20:05.070
<b>"When we exist, death is not;</b>

20:05.570 --> 20:07.780
<b>and when death exists, we are not."</b>

20:08.830 --> 20:10.120
<b>Or as Seneca said,</b>

20:10.620 --> 20:14.210
<b>"Life is long if you know how to use it."</b>

20:15.210 --> 20:17.420
<b>I agree with all of them.</b>

20:19.210 --> 20:22.010
<b>Those things were said</b>

20:22.090 --> 20:24.010
<b>by heathens from 2,000 years ago!</b>

20:24.090 --> 20:26.720
<b>They had no absolute God or salvation!</b>

20:26.800 --> 20:28.470
<b>What good are their words?!</b>

20:30.600 --> 20:31.560
<b>They inspire me.</b>

20:32.060 --> 20:32.980
<b>In…</b>

20:35.650 --> 20:37.770
<b>Hubert died and disappeared.</b>

20:38.480 --> 20:41.860
<b>But the inspiration
he left me hasn't faded.</b>

20:43.070 --> 20:44.780
<b>I think inspiration</b>

20:44.860 --> 20:47.990
<b>is probably more important than lifespan.</b>

20:48.580 --> 20:50.120
<b>So faced with this choice,</b>

20:51.910 --> 20:53.830
<b>I will let inspiration survive,</b>

20:54.330 --> 20:56.330
<b>even if it costs me my own life.</b>

20:58.710 --> 21:00.380
<b>You're out of your mind.</b>

21:01.170 --> 21:04.420
<b>You're sacrificing your life
for something you don't understand.</b>

21:05.180 --> 21:06.720
<b>Can't you see</b>

21:07.220 --> 21:09.220
<b>how that is madness?</b>

21:10.720 --> 21:11.720
<b>You're right.</b>

21:13.140 --> 21:16.440
<b>But you could also call it "love."</b>

21:24.950 --> 21:28.410
<b>Now then. May I ask to be alone?</b>

21:29.700 --> 21:31.700
<b>Is it time already?</b>

21:33.000 --> 21:35.040
<b>Yes. Bye now.</b>

22:41.560 --> 22:43.480
<b>TEN YEARS LATER</b>

22:52.740 --> 22:54.740
<b>It should be higher up.</b>

22:57.660 --> 22:59.920
<b>Why is this happening to me?</b>

23:13.640 --> 23:14.510
<b>This…</b>

23:15.100 --> 23:15.970
<b>This is it.</b>

23:27.280 --> 23:28.280
<b>Earth?</b>
