00:01.340 --> 00:06.230
Thousands of years have passed since all 
of humanity was mysteriously petrified.

00:07.660 --> 00:10.990
Those of us who revived into the 
primitive, post-apocalyptic world

00:11.990 --> 00:14.930
worked diligently to rebuild 
science from scratch.

00:15.260 --> 00:19.830
We finally reached the milestone of building 
a ship that would take us across the Pacific.

00:25.170 --> 00:28.960
To those hearing this 
recording, nice to meet you.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.750
I am reporter Hokutozai Minami.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.210
I leave this record for posterity.

00:34.630 --> 00:38.620
We are on our way to discovering the secret 
behind the petrification of humanity.

00:38.970 --> 00:42.710
Our destination is the 
enemy's home base: the moon!

00:44.270 --> 00:48.530
This is a big project that will take us 
from the stone age to building a spaceship.

00:48.530 --> 00:53.140
We'll gather materials from all over 
the world, starting in the Americas.

00:53.810 --> 00:58.320
Let's ask the crew what they have to say!

00:59.140 --> 01:18.090
<b>Strongest Primate High Schooler</b>

00:59.390 --> 01:04.150
Once we revive all of humanity, 
there will be those who misuse firearms,

01:04.150 --> 01:08.330
and those who gain power 
and try to exploit others.

01:08.990 --> 01:10.850
I won't let them do that.

01:10.850 --> 01:13.010
I won't let them taint the 
hands of science with blood.

01:14.620 --> 01:16.680
My task now is to make sure of that.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.090

The girls overseas are pretty cute, too.

01:25.030 --> 01:29.040
Also, the Statue of Liberty might still 
be there, since it's made of copper.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.340
Not that I'd know.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.850
Sorries.

01:31.850 --> 01:33.650

01:34.020 --> 01:38.420

02:13.150 --> 02:14.240
I know!

02:14.240 --> 02:17.210
You and Kinro might get along well, 
since you're both so uptight.

02:17.210 --> 02:18.700
Well? What do you think?

02:18.700 --> 02:20.490

02:26.450 --> 02:27.910
We must train harder!

02:28.890 --> 02:30.540
And yet, look at Ginro!

02:31.060 --> 02:34.710
What would have become of him if Matsukaze 
hadn't been taking care of him?

02:34.750 --> 02:42.430

02:37.430 --> 02:40.430
No, I merely served as his legs for a while.

02:40.430 --> 02:42.430
I haven't done anything of particular note.

02:42.710 --> 02:45.170
Yeah, my legs...

02:45.170 --> 02:48.000

hell right before our departure.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.850

02:49.850 --> 02:54.430

02:55.400 --> 03:04.740
<b>Scumbag Warrior</b>

02:55.570 --> 03:02.500

"Master!" and brought me on board.

I'm so glad!

03:06.200 --> 03:07.480

Yeah, that's about right, meathead.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.950
We're fighting.

05:37.950 --> 05:42.130

05:42.130 --> 05:44.710
Crazy ability to learn.

05:47.110 --> 05:49.370
You're talking about the route to the US, huh?

05:50.620 --> 05:52.810
That's why you used to be a submariner.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.160
You just get it.

05:54.470 --> 05:56.620
We departed from Tokyo.

05:56.620 --> 05:57.920
And our destination?

05:57.920 --> 05:59.400
The US, right?

05:59.400 --> 06:00.080
Yup.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.520
Right here.

06:03.350 --> 06:06.900
What's the quickest route to San Francisco?

06:06.900 --> 06:10.090
Straight, like this, right?

06:10.090 --> 06:12.230
Even I know that.

06:12.230 --> 06:15.270
Hang on, that's too easy.

06:15.270 --> 06:17.310
This has to be a trick question.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.830
Good answer!

06:19.830 --> 06:25.050
That's called the rhumb line, where you go 
in the same direction for the whole route.

06:20.460 --> 06:24.710
<b>Rhumb Line</b>

06:25.450 --> 06:29.450

have been doing it throughout most of history.

06:36.970 --> 06:39.500

this!

06:43.240 --> 06:44.360
How?!

06:44.360 --> 06:46.420

06:46.420 --> 06:48.540

Try comparing it for yourself on that globe.

06:56.010 --> 06:57.010
Go for it.

07:08.330 --> 07:11.410
The route that looked further on 
the map is actually a lot shorter!

07:11.410 --> 07:12.520
You're right!

07:12.520 --> 07:14.740
That's what happens when it's a sphere.

07:14.740 --> 07:16.830
That's the actual shortest distance.

07:16.890 --> 07:23.670
<b>Great circle route</b>

07:17.190 --> 07:19.100

Seventy days! We're taking the rhumb line!

07:27.380 --> 07:31.550

constantly depending on our position.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.590

07:33.590 --> 07:35.570

but we're a band of newbie sailors.

07:56.330 --> 07:57.800
I guarantee you we'll go down!

07:57.800 --> 08:00.630

08:00.630 --> 08:02.580

08:05.680 --> 08:06.660
Am I wrong?

08:06.980 --> 08:10.800
We won't make it in time 
for the yellow dent corn.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.800
We'll barely make it by fall 
if we arrive in 40 days.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.150
That's as late as we can be 
if we're making revival fluid.

08:19.470 --> 08:24.130
Dick around for 70 days, 
and winter will be too late.

08:24.130 --> 08:28.190
We'll be losing a whole year 
of our insanely precious time.

08:28.190 --> 08:30.540
Forty days is absolute.

08:30.540 --> 08:33.830

<i>Ryusui, who's being unwaveringly 
realistic for the sake of our crew,</i>

<i>and Senku, who's being unwaveringly 
rational for the sake of the future.</i>

08:52.490 --> 08:55.750
<i>There is no right answer here.</i>

08:57.360 --> 09:02.230
If they're both right, I think 
I'm with Ryusui-chan on this one.

09:02.230 --> 09:05.020
I can't stand arduous work.

09:06.230 --> 09:08.400

09:08.720 --> 09:11.440
We need to get there as soon as we can.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.890
Of course you'd say that, Kohaku-chan.

09:13.890 --> 09:15.740
You're always the immediate action type.

09:17.580 --> 09:20.080

09:20.300 --> 09:22.120
Yeah, that's the answer.

09:22.780 --> 09:25.320
That'll halve our maximum voyage time.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.420
Are you sure?

09:26.860 --> 09:28.830
We'll be fine as long as we get there earlier.

09:29.750 --> 09:30.960
<b>70 Days to the US</b>

on the outfit? Dumbass.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.230
Why else?

10:20.230 --> 10:24.060
To let the gallery know 
that this is a formal game.

10:24.380 --> 10:27.420
That'll make sure everyone 
follows the victor's wishes.

10:27.420 --> 10:31.060

11:53.030 --> 11:55.620
I'll deal the first five cards.

11:57.010 --> 12:00.480
We'll take turns dealing each round.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.320
Shall we choose the first dealer 
with a game of rock-paper-scissors?

12:03.320 --> 12:04.560
Okay.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.390
First comes rock.

12:06.390 --> 12:07.990
Rock-paper-scissors.

12:07.990 --> 12:11.460
My bad, I didn't want to get in the 
way of the rock-paper-scissors.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.250
I can't believe I did that.

12:15.890 --> 12:17.830
Oh, that's odd.

12:17.830 --> 12:22.920
It appeared as though you 
were carrying those cards.

12:23.320 --> 12:28.050
I'll admit that I jumped the gun if the 
first card isn't the ace of hearts.

12:37.550 --> 12:38.800
What's this?

12:39.120 --> 12:40.530
What a surprise!

12:44.650 --> 12:47.910
Don't let this lanky bastard touch the cards!

12:47.910 --> 12:49.580
That's harsh!

12:50.310 --> 12:51.200
Raise.

12:51.740 --> 12:52.790
Call.

12:53.710 --> 12:55.000
Full house.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.080
Three-of-a-kind.

13:00.590 --> 13:01.960
Straight.

13:02.180 --> 13:03.330
Flush!

13:03.870 --> 13:06.320
They're neck-and-neck so far.

13:06.320 --> 13:10.300
Ryusui has a few more chips, though.

13:12.380 --> 13:13.270
Raise.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.020
He's raising the stakes dramatically.

13:16.020 --> 13:19.460
Will Senku-kun accept?

13:20.770 --> 13:26.050
<i>Ryusui's so self-assured, I have 
no idea if he's bluffing or not.</i>

13:30.440 --> 13:31.760
I call.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.890
You sprinkled something onto the deck.

13:44.420 --> 13:45.950
Sugar, maybe?

13:46.260 --> 13:49.340
<i>He could be trying to make 
the card move less evenly.</i>

13:49.570 --> 13:52.660
But, but... I never touched the card!

13:52.660 --> 13:54.660
No placing your hand <i>over</i> the cards, either!

13:55.180 --> 13:56.560
Yes, ma'am.

14:01.060 --> 14:03.360
<i>Ah, so that's what that was.</i>

14:03.360 --> 14:05.500
Kohaku, check Gen's sleeve.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.900
A kanabun beetle?!

14:09.900 --> 14:11.980
How are you supposed to cheat with that?

14:11.980 --> 14:16.120
Its antennae react to the 
card with the sugar on it.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.700
Just how sketchy do you have to be?!

14:18.700 --> 14:20.130
I'm out of tricks!

14:20.130 --> 14:22.090
I haven't done anything! I swear!

14:22.090 --> 14:25.960
You can check all the cards 
if you have any doubts.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.590
Each and every card.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.050
Carefully.

14:39.900 --> 14:43.730
<i>Everyone's eyes, including mine and 
Kohaku's, are on the deck right now!</i>

14:45.940 --> 14:47.820
I raise to the max!

14:47.820 --> 14:50.920
Ryusui-kun has bet even more chips!

14:50.920 --> 14:53.860
Is this to be his finishing blow?

14:54.940 --> 14:58.000
<i>Ryusui's hand changed direction 
in that brief moment.</i>

14:59.400 --> 15:00.710
<i>Hasn't it?!</i>

15:02.660 --> 15:05.050
You switched his hand, didn't you, Gen?!

15:05.050 --> 15:07.330
That's an awful accusation.

15:07.330 --> 15:12.600
You diverted everyone's attention 
using the bug and the card check.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.300
Basic magic.

15:16.310 --> 15:18.610
I should have known, Gen.

15:18.610 --> 15:22.060
You seemed unusually careless there.

15:22.060 --> 15:24.530
You let your opponent have a 
comfy win with the easy trick,

15:24.530 --> 15:30.680
had everyone focus on the deck, 
and swapped four of his cards.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.990
So all that prep was to pull off this one move.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.010
<i>If he's been setting it up this whole time, 
all four of them have to be aces,</i>

15:42.590 --> 15:44.900
<i>the four strongest cards!</i>

15:46.180 --> 15:50.510
<i>The only way Senku can win 
now is with a straight flush.</i>

15:51.080 --> 15:52.950
<i>There's no way!</i>

16:03.270 --> 16:06.390
The second card from the top.

16:06.390 --> 16:09.610
The second card from the bottom.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.800
<i>Senku, you're going to have to fold.</i>

16:12.800 --> 16:14.410
All right, then.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.830
I'm all-in, too.

16:30.410 --> 16:32.280
He's all-in!

16:32.280 --> 16:35.470
He's betting all of his chips!

16:35.470 --> 16:37.630
But why?

16:38.820 --> 16:41.000
<i>Diverting everyone's attention...</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:42.890
<i>Basic magic!</i>

16:42.890 --> 16:44.850
All right, we'll...

16:44.850 --> 16:46.340
draw three cards.

16:46.340 --> 16:47.660
Too fast!

16:47.660 --> 16:50.520
Did you really take from the top of the deck?!

16:51.020 --> 16:53.620
Of course. What a nasty accusation.

16:55.260 --> 16:57.600
She took cards from the middle of the deck.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.410
Why would they do that, though?

17:00.410 --> 17:03.500
They can't even see which cards they were.

17:04.150 --> 17:08.290
I don't see anything that could be a mark.

17:09.700 --> 17:13.460
So it could be entirely a bluff.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.170
You amuse me!

17:18.170 --> 17:20.050
Very well, let's settle it now!

17:20.050 --> 17:21.800
We're both all-in!

17:21.800 --> 17:23.770
It's on!

17:25.260 --> 17:26.390
Four-of-a-kind!

17:33.800 --> 17:36.280
Royal straight flush.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.280
What?!

17:39.590 --> 17:42.290
All the chips are mine! I win!

17:45.460 --> 17:47.810
There are five aces.

17:47.810 --> 17:49.920
I guess that doesn't even matter anymore, huh?

17:50.840 --> 17:52.580
H-H-How?!

17:52.580 --> 17:54.980
I have no idea how they did it!

17:54.980 --> 17:56.660
I don't see a mark anywhere!

17:56.660 --> 17:58.860
Of course you don't.

17:58.860 --> 18:02.010
The mark of science is 
transparent and colorless.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.160
Urushiol.

18:04.160 --> 18:08.590
There happened to be some urushi 
lacquer lying around, so I took some.

18:09.090 --> 18:14.290
I've been looking for key cards from the 
beginning and rubbing the lacquer into the edges.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.410
Urushi just happened to be lying around?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.760
We coated it with urushi 
lacquer so it records better!

18:22.480 --> 18:27.230
How could anyone see that 
urushi-whatever if it's transparent?

18:27.230 --> 18:30.040
How come Senku could tell?

18:32.260 --> 18:34.380
Oh, of course...

18:34.790 --> 18:39.800
Senku-chan has super urushi-sensitive skin.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.020
The winner: Senku!

18:43.070 --> 18:45.460
You're risking your life too much for a bet.

18:46.720 --> 18:50.630
We're taking the great circle 
route across the Pacific Ocean.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.980
It's ten billion percent harder.

18:52.980 --> 18:55.610
We'll coordinate with Ruri 
and the others back home

18:55.610 --> 18:59.720
and GPS our way across Earth. 
It's the shortcut of science.

19:00.450 --> 19:02.880
Jackpot!

19:02.880 --> 19:05.460
I blew nearly all my wealth!

19:05.460 --> 19:07.120
Damn it!

19:07.520 --> 19:08.340
One more!

19:08.340 --> 19:10.070
I'm winning it all back with the next one!

19:10.070 --> 19:11.950
Let's do one more!

19:11.950 --> 19:13.750
We're obviously not doing that.

19:13.750 --> 19:14.760
Very well!

19:14.760 --> 19:15.670
Really?

19:16.720 --> 19:17.870
On one condition.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.340
We're doing it here!

19:20.400 --> 19:22.470
<b>Whoaaa</b>

19:35.770 --> 19:41.700
As luck would have it, you got 
that casino you've always wanted.

19:42.980 --> 19:45.280
Leisure is a perfectly valid part of strategy.

19:45.940 --> 19:49.140
We're shaving a whole 30 days off our trip.

19:49.140 --> 19:51.960
We'll have to make up for it by improving 
conditions on the ship for the crew.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.130
<b>70 Days to the US</b>

19:52.970 --> 19:55.280
We lose ten days with increased food.

19:54.130 --> 19:56.750
<b>60 Days to the US</b>

19:55.800 --> 19:58.570
Another ten with leisure facilities.

19:56.750 --> 20:03.090
<b>50 Days to the US</b>

19:58.570 --> 20:03.090
I want one more thing to make 
up for the last ten days.

20:04.930 --> 20:08.970
After food and leisure, 
all that's left is drinks.

20:13.110 --> 20:16.110
They're setting up a new shop here.

20:17.010 --> 20:19.160
"Bar FranÃ§ois"...

20:19.820 --> 20:22.040
A bar? Do you mean...

20:23.110 --> 20:24.570
Booze?!

20:44.520 --> 20:46.490
Let's rejuvenate ourselves, all!

20:45.720 --> 20:47.800
m 0 0 l 246 0 l 246 80 l 0 80

20:45.720 --> 20:47.800
Beer
acquired!!

20:46.490 --> 20:47.800
Cheers!

20:54.100 --> 20:55.600
More!

20:57.690 --> 21:00.730
So that makes up the last ten days.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.700
Everything worked out the way Senku wanted.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.570
It's a little too perfect, don't you think?

21:07.770 --> 21:10.930
The poker battle made the casino a huge success.

21:10.930 --> 21:13.180
It's a benefit package that 
includes a bar to boot.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.320
We'll survive a harsh route just fine now.

21:16.820 --> 21:22.300
Even if it was Ryusui who won, 
it might have ended up the same.

21:22.970 --> 21:28.430
In other words, it was all a set-up, 
starting with Ryusui and Senku fighting.

21:28.960 --> 21:34.740
The whole thing might have been 
theater, choreographed by a mentalist.

21:34.740 --> 21:37.060
How's that for a fun conspiracy theory?

21:38.760 --> 21:41.270
What the heck are you talking about, Ukyo-chan?

21:41.270 --> 21:43.030
You're reading way too much into it.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.000
Though...

21:45.670 --> 21:47.730
I will say one thing.

21:47.730 --> 21:52.540
The poker game was super legit.

21:53.410 --> 21:57.570
That's one thing I'm still bummed about.

21:57.570 --> 21:58.920
Just a little.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.870
Senku-chan.

22:02.170 --> 22:02.920
<b>50 Days to the US</b>

22:02.920 --> 22:06.670
<b>40 Days to the US</b>

22:02.920 --> 22:06.670
Now we'll be in the New World in no time.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.650
This is exhilarating.

23:52.010 --> 23:54.950
