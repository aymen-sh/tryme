WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:05.990
And so, we Miburo became 
agents of the Aizu Domain.

00:06.130 --> 00:08.680
Whoa! The Shinsengumi were tough!

00:08.680 --> 00:10.770
You caught all the bad guys!

00:11.140 --> 00:12.850
Hey, Nagakura-sensei...

00:14.160 --> 00:15.670
Yes, Tsuru?

00:15.670 --> 00:19.120
Who was the strongest guy 
in the Shinsengumi?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.930
The strongest, huh?

00:24.150 --> 00:25.870
That reminds me...

00:28.790 --> 00:31.390
Who among us is truly strong?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.410
When the dust settles, 
who will be left standing?

00:35.110 --> 00:39.080
We'll find out with the first ever 
Grand Miburo Drinking Contest!

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

00:53.240 --> 00:58.950
<b>Blue Miburo</b>

02:15.190 --> 02:18.820
It's late! Keep your voices down!

02:20.690 --> 02:25.760
<i>Our hosts, the Yagis, gave us sake 
to celebrate our new status,</i>

02:26.630 --> 02:28.980
<i>but the party turned into a ruckus.</i>

02:29.870 --> 02:32.240
Now, Serizawa-sensei will close us out.

02:32.240 --> 02:32.960
Very well.

02:33.340 --> 02:35.090
Kondo-sensei will lead the toast.

02:36.000 --> 02:36.630
Very well.

02:39.030 --> 02:41.220
To our grand new patron—

02:43.570 --> 02:45.100
K-Kondo-san?!

02:45.310 --> 02:47.180
Who will be the last man standing?

02:47.180 --> 02:48.040
Me!

02:48.040 --> 02:49.860
I will!

02:50.450 --> 02:52.360
He has no tolerance whatsoever.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.110
Why didn't you stop him?!

02:57.480 --> 02:59.790
Toss the corpses to one side.

03:01.520 --> 03:02.960
Anyway, time to party!

03:02.960 --> 03:04.320
Drink up!

03:06.750 --> 03:09.460
My father was always a happy drunk.

03:10.550 --> 03:11.570
I see.

03:11.570 --> 03:13.040
Look, Nio.

03:13.220 --> 03:16.220
This here's a seppuku scar.

03:16.220 --> 03:17.710
Cool, right?

03:17.710 --> 03:19.800
Why'd you take your clothes off?!

03:19.800 --> 03:22.300
What cheap sake.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.450
Who cares? As long as it gets us drunk.

03:24.450 --> 03:25.550
You heard me!

03:25.740 --> 03:27.160
Is that good enough for you?!

03:27.160 --> 03:29.680
I'm asking if you're ready to die!

03:29.680 --> 03:30.910
Well?!

03:30.910 --> 03:34.170
Yamanami-san, what are you 
yelling at that wall about?!

03:34.180 --> 03:36.400
I'm still in the game!

03:36.640 --> 03:38.370
Hang in there.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.580
What a waste of time.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.460
He got drunk just <i>sniffing</i> it?!

04:01.470 --> 04:02.760
<i>It's almost over.</i>

04:03.360 --> 04:04.880
<i>I hope none of them get back up.</i>

04:05.960 --> 04:07.020
<i>It's now a duel.</i>

04:07.580 --> 04:10.450
<i>Hijikata-san versus Serizawa-san.</i>

04:12.160 --> 04:12.900
Here, sir.

04:17.760 --> 04:23.350
Hijikata, maybe we oughta 
sit down and talk, man-to-man.

04:23.550 --> 04:24.420
Oh?

04:25.640 --> 04:28.160
And what would we discuss?

04:28.500 --> 04:30.190
The Miburo's future.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.600
What do you mean by that?

04:36.570 --> 04:43.320
You don't seem to think too highly
 of our answering to Aizu.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.520
I don't mind it.

04:46.820 --> 04:50.060
I just wonder if it's really necessary.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.960
We need a patron to vouch for us.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.320
Why?

04:54.770 --> 04:58.070
It gives us some leeway to go wild.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.780
Serizawa-san.

05:02.360 --> 05:07.200
We didn't come here to throw our 
weight around for our own benefit.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.200
What?!

05:09.490 --> 05:12.470
I was <i>born</i> to throw my weight around!

05:12.470 --> 05:14.280
Weren't you?

05:15.530 --> 05:17.500
What drives you to act this way?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.090
You want to know?

05:26.930 --> 05:28.300
My turtle.

05:28.700 --> 05:29.380
Huh?

05:30.360 --> 05:34.590
My older brother stomped my turtle dead.

05:34.590 --> 05:36.400
What? Why?

05:36.400 --> 05:38.370
How should I know?

05:39.110 --> 05:43.650
I let him have it! Punched his
 lights out! You should've seen it.

05:43.650 --> 05:48.820
His face puffed up to twice its size.

05:49.330 --> 05:52.480
Well, I can't blame you.

05:52.740 --> 05:55.080
I realize how you must have felt, sir.

05:57.200 --> 06:02.040
I got ordered to my room 
without food for three days. He didn't.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.440
I was the fourth son, you see.

06:05.970 --> 06:10.670
I thought that was wrong. 
I thought it made no sense.

06:11.400 --> 06:17.320
But I had brawn, 
so I decided to take it all.

06:18.090 --> 06:22.180
I want the finest women! 
I want to build a castle!

06:22.750 --> 06:25.120
I want my own domain!

06:27.190 --> 06:29.730
Does that sound crazy?

06:30.750 --> 06:31.410
No.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.470
About that castle. 
Do you care where you build it?

06:37.750 --> 06:40.590
Hm? What do you mean?

06:40.960 --> 06:45.350
I'd build mine in Hino,
in the countryside outside Edo.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.820
I grew up in Tama, 
the Shogun's personal domain.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.540
We didn't exactly want 
for nothing, but it wasn't bad.

06:56.160 --> 06:56.880
<i>I get it.</i>

06:57.550 --> 07:00.020
<i>I totally get that hometown feeling.</i>

07:00.020 --> 07:01.230
Pathetic!

07:01.610 --> 07:04.330
Leaving my hometown set me free.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.860
I don't owe it squat.

07:07.810 --> 07:10.120
Don't let where you were born tie you down.

07:10.540 --> 07:14.140
Fight on wherever you end up!

07:14.440 --> 07:17.330
Keep screaming, "Here I am!"

07:17.610 --> 07:22.620
That's what it means to be a man.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.440
Am I right, Nio?

07:30.830 --> 07:32.070
Well...

07:32.310 --> 07:36.540
I want to protect this city I grew up in.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.590
You want to protect the <i>city?!</i>

07:39.590 --> 07:41.930
As if any one person could!

07:41.930 --> 07:43.300
Don't get conceited!

07:44.810 --> 07:48.270
You haven't got a clue.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.030
I'm going to sleep.

07:55.370 --> 07:57.400
He means, "Use your imagination."

07:58.360 --> 08:01.500
We know you care about this city.

08:02.230 --> 08:04.920
But what if you were driven out of it?

08:05.390 --> 08:06.680
Would you just die?

08:08.620 --> 08:11.890
I think that's the point 
Serizawa was trying to make.

08:13.340 --> 08:14.600
Anyway, think on it.

08:15.460 --> 08:16.920
I'm turning in, too.

08:24.520 --> 08:29.110
<i>What would I do if I left Kyoto?
 I have no idea.</i>

08:30.720 --> 08:33.030
Are they finally all asleep?

08:33.400 --> 08:35.280
It's nearly dawn.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.840
Do you like this city, Taro-kun?

08:37.840 --> 08:41.410
Why would I?! Do you <i>know</i> how 
many times I've nearly died here?!

08:41.410 --> 08:42.640
Oh, right.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.230
<i>Why do I like this city?</i>

08:47.620 --> 08:49.920
<i>Granny. Iroha.</i>

08:50.490 --> 08:53.170
<i>I miss you so much now, 
and I don't know why.</i>

08:56.920 --> 08:59.170
Hey! Someone's still up!

09:01.180 --> 09:02.320
Inoue-san!

09:02.640 --> 09:05.620
I... win.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.940
<i>The Grand Drinking Contest ended with
 Inoue Genzaburo emerging triumphant,</i>

09:12.190 --> 09:15.480
<i>but history took no notice.</i>

09:19.640 --> 09:22.040
Talk about a slow day, huh?

09:22.280 --> 09:24.200
That's the best we can hope for.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.960
I know, but—

09:26.490 --> 09:27.120
Hey.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.420
Isn't this your grandma's 
dango place, Nio-kun?

09:33.420 --> 09:34.090
Yes, it is.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.380
Guess I shouldn't be surprised 
it's closed at this hour.

09:44.230 --> 09:45.200
Come along, Nio.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.870
Y-Yes, sir.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.760
I sure am hungry for dango now.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.440
Let us make a banner for the Miburo.

09:56.510 --> 09:57.710
Where did this come from?

09:58.030 --> 10:00.140
That may be a good idea.

10:00.140 --> 10:04.200
The sight of a military banner 
should discourage wrongdoers.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.110
No, it will look grand.

10:06.610 --> 10:09.710
I've always admired the 47 Ronin of Ako.

10:11.020 --> 10:12.200
A banner?

10:12.480 --> 10:16.870
I think it'd be nice if we all
 wore matching coats, too.

10:17.170 --> 10:18.350
That's it!

10:20.560 --> 10:21.950
What kind of coat do we want?

10:21.950 --> 10:23.680
Something stylish and dashing.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.270
No, first the banner—

10:25.270 --> 10:26.000
Wait.

10:27.540 --> 10:30.980
I know an old dango seller 
with an eye for fancy clothes.

10:32.460 --> 10:35.320
You mean Nio-kun's grandma, right?

10:35.830 --> 10:38.120
She'd be perfect for the job.

10:38.470 --> 10:39.530
Hijikata-san.

10:43.190 --> 10:44.990
What's this about?

10:45.260 --> 10:46.390
Serizawa-san.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.720
We were discussing 
matching coats for our uniforms.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.280
Uniforms?

10:52.280 --> 10:53.200
And a banner.

10:53.670 --> 10:55.710
Would you mind leaving it in my hands?

10:57.580 --> 10:58.870
Make it pale blue-green.

10:58.870 --> 11:03.560
Ah, Inoue-san <i>did</i> win the 
Grand Drinking Contest yesterday.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.960
That's a dirty trick!

11:06.960 --> 11:09.880
What does that have to do with this?

11:09.880 --> 11:11.180
Very well.

11:11.840 --> 11:16.320
But make sure mine stands out from the rest.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.120
Nio, get going.

11:20.120 --> 11:20.820
Yes, sir!

11:21.650 --> 11:23.640
Taro, go with him.

11:23.640 --> 11:24.820
Y-Yes, sir!

11:25.120 --> 11:26.790
You, too, Hajime.

11:26.790 --> 11:27.750
What for?!

11:27.750 --> 11:30.320
Good idea. Send the whole boy brigade.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.080
Don't treat me like a kid!

11:34.240 --> 11:35.470
Three glazed!

11:35.470 --> 11:36.580
You got it!

11:36.890 --> 11:41.380
Hey, lady, where's my zenzai soup? 
I've been waiting half an hour—

11:41.560 --> 11:42.640
Pipe down.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.360
Stop whining and lend a hand, why don't you?

11:45.360 --> 11:46.390
Granny!

11:46.590 --> 11:48.760
Hi. I'm home.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.520
If it isn't...

11:55.830 --> 11:56.480
Granny!

11:57.450 --> 11:58.570
Who're you?

11:58.570 --> 12:00.010
It's me, Nio!

12:00.010 --> 12:02.350
Did you forget me?! Have you gone senile?!

12:02.610 --> 12:06.370
Who're you calling "senile"? 
I recognize you all right, Nio.

12:06.580 --> 12:08.940
But your eyes...

12:09.440 --> 12:10.120
Hm?

12:10.600 --> 12:11.420
Who're you?

12:11.420 --> 12:14.080
This is Taro-kun and Hajime-kun.
 They're in the Miburo, too.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.240
I've got new help!

12:21.240 --> 12:22.080
What?

12:22.960 --> 12:26.790
W-Welcome to the Chirinuya.

12:26.790 --> 12:28.740
Speak up, Hajime!

12:28.740 --> 12:31.760
I-I'm a samurai! You can't expect me to do this!

12:31.990 --> 12:33.760
What's that got to do with it?

12:34.270 --> 12:36.390
Look at him.

12:36.580 --> 12:39.560
Another order of dango? Coming right up.

12:39.940 --> 12:40.680
Thanks.

12:40.990 --> 12:42.280
No, thank you!

12:42.280 --> 12:44.540
That'll be 60 mon.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.780
Good work, Taro. You've got 
a good head on your shoulders.

12:47.950 --> 12:50.290
This is kind of fun!

12:50.520 --> 12:52.510
Fine, I'll do it. Happy now?

12:52.510 --> 12:54.420
Excuse me, I'd like some dango—

12:54.420 --> 12:57.170
You want dango? 
You'd better eat every last one.

12:57.170 --> 12:58.800
Why are you threatening him?

12:59.120 --> 13:00.800
Follow Taro's example.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.240
This is where I <i>really</i> belong!

13:04.830 --> 13:06.000
Thanks.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.540
Don't mention it!

13:07.840 --> 13:10.060
Okay, time to close up shop for the day.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.080
I-I'm dead tired.

13:12.380 --> 13:13.430
Thanks for the help.

13:13.430 --> 13:16.190
Taro, you're so cut out for this business.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.690
I can't stop crying and I don't know why.

13:19.690 --> 13:21.100
Now, clean up.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.360
And make it snappy.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.120
Yes, ma'am!

13:29.040 --> 13:30.910
Yowch.

13:29.910 --> 13:33.530
<i>Granny looks a little shorter than before.</i>

13:34.120 --> 13:35.040
She's tough.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.050
Huh? You mean Granny?

13:37.390 --> 13:40.290
Yeah. I guess you'd call her a master.

13:41.070 --> 13:44.770
No ordinary lady her age 
could run this place alone.

13:45.130 --> 13:47.200
It's a pretty big shop.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.190
Yes, you've got a point.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.900
That takes toughness.

13:51.310 --> 13:54.560
I guess the sword isn't 
the only way to be strong.

13:55.220 --> 13:58.250
She guards her livelihood 
day after day without complaint.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.560
I could never do that.

14:03.470 --> 14:07.260
I hear this whole place burned down once,

14:08.040 --> 14:11.230
but she borrowed money 
from all over to rebuild it.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.750
Is that so?

14:13.600 --> 14:17.540
Then she took in my sister, 
Iroha, and me, and raised us.

14:19.220 --> 14:22.280
I wonder where she gets 
that kind of strength from.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.530
Don't ask me.

14:25.440 --> 14:30.760
I've always wanted to become a 
strong person who can protect people,

14:31.100 --> 14:32.480
like Granny does.

14:34.430 --> 14:37.920
I left home so I could
 learn how from the Miburo.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.120
So you get it from her.

14:41.120 --> 14:41.840
Huh?

14:42.450 --> 14:45.300
I think I figured out 
what makes you so shameless.

14:46.740 --> 14:49.800
Nio! Hajime! Get in here and lend a hand!

14:50.000 --> 14:50.860
Let's go.

14:50.860 --> 14:51.400
Right.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.460
Nio, I almost forgot.

14:56.970 --> 14:58.240
Welcome home.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.250
You came back looking a lot 
more grown-up than when you left.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.980
<i>Oh, thank goodness.</i>

15:07.840 --> 15:09.720
Yup! It's good to be home!

15:10.360 --> 15:13.830
<i>I got to come home and
 see Granny's face again.</i>

15:14.490 --> 15:15.780
Now, get moving.

15:15.780 --> 15:18.760
Come spend the night, you three.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.420
Thanks. We'd love to.

15:21.730 --> 15:22.770
Excuse me?

15:22.770 --> 15:25.770
You'd better not be thinking 
of working us again tomorrow!

15:25.770 --> 15:29.030
Sleepover! Sleepover!

15:29.030 --> 15:31.880
Lucky me!

15:29.480 --> 15:31.850
Matching jackets for the Miburo?

15:31.850 --> 15:36.290
Yeah. Hijikata-san wants you
 to think up a design for us.

15:31.880 --> 15:35.280
We're all sleeping over, happy as can be!

15:35.280 --> 15:40.800
We're not going home; 
we're sleeping over, all smiley!

15:36.640 --> 15:40.380
Well, I can't turn down such a handsome man.

15:40.800 --> 15:46.470
We're all sleeping over at Granny's place!

15:46.470 --> 15:48.260
Would you shut up already?

15:48.260 --> 15:50.340
I can see Taro-kun's eyes <i>sparkling!</i>

15:52.620 --> 15:54.890
Those Miburo are a funny bunch.

15:54.890 --> 15:57.940
I couldn't believe how much they drank.

15:58.510 --> 15:59.840
They're a bunch of idiots.

16:00.610 --> 16:02.980
This is great! I can't get enough, Granny!

16:02.980 --> 16:05.600
How good could dried sardines be?

16:06.220 --> 16:11.610
Still, the Miburo's job is nabbing rascals
 and chopping 'em up, isn't it?

16:11.610 --> 16:14.520
Are you boys really safe with them?

16:14.520 --> 16:16.360
We don't use swords without good reason.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.370
Our job is to make sure the people of Kyoto
 can live in peace. We keep the city safe.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.120
Keep the city safe?

16:26.940 --> 16:30.160
Our first duty is guarding the 
Tokugawa Shogun who came here from Edo.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.880
Yup. That's important, too.

16:32.360 --> 16:36.760
Keeping the city safe? 
That's good. A mighty fine job.

16:38.090 --> 16:38.600
Yeah.

16:39.930 --> 16:42.440
By the way, how's Iroha?

16:42.440 --> 16:45.900
Oh, I'm sure she's fine. 
She sends me letters sometimes.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.850
Iroha always hated writing.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.400
She must be working hard.

16:54.040 --> 16:54.650
Right.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.170
After dinner, it's time for a bath.

16:57.170 --> 16:59.450
What? I hate baths.

16:59.450 --> 17:03.750
Yes, yes. I'll take mine later, 
so hurry up and take your turns.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.780
Don't peek now.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.250
As if!

17:12.600 --> 17:16.410
I borrowed bedding from the neighbors,
 but it'll be a tight fit.

17:17.020 --> 17:18.310
All right!

17:20.970 --> 17:22.180
I'd rather sleep here.

17:22.180 --> 17:24.140
You'll never get a good night's sleep that way.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.760
Samurai don't sleep deeply.

17:26.950 --> 17:28.770
I know just what you mean, Hajime!

17:29.080 --> 17:31.800
You're so excited that 
you can't sleep a wink, right?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.520
Get to bed, you.

17:37.200 --> 17:37.860
Granny.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.960
Yes?

17:40.940 --> 17:44.280
Sorry we dropped in so suddenly.
 Was it a bother?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.480
Of course not.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.290
Don't say things like that.

17:49.820 --> 17:50.510
Okay.

17:55.260 --> 17:57.040
But what if you were driven out of it?

17:57.550 --> 17:59.000
Would you just die?

18:00.190 --> 18:05.130
What would you do if you couldn't 
live here in Kyoto anymore?

18:06.640 --> 18:09.280
What do you mean? 
Is that supposed to be funny?

18:09.610 --> 18:12.150
No. I'm serious.

18:15.890 --> 18:19.400
I'd die. This old woman will die here.

18:19.870 --> 18:26.430
If I couldn't stay in Kyoto, I'd die here 
on the spot. You ought to know that.

18:27.550 --> 18:30.400
Yeah. I thought you'd say that.

18:31.070 --> 18:34.160
I like it here, so I feel the same way.

18:34.940 --> 18:36.020
But why?

18:36.720 --> 18:38.680
Why does this place mean so much to you?

18:39.060 --> 18:41.580
Why? Well...

18:42.640 --> 18:45.180
I had a real stroke of luck here.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.750
Luck?

18:47.870 --> 18:51.680
I got to live here with you and Iroha, Nio.

18:54.070 --> 18:57.040
I feel that even more now that I'm on my own.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.280
Granny, I want to apologize.

19:03.460 --> 19:04.570
What for?

19:05.070 --> 19:10.290
When I first came here, you invited me 
to New Year's shrine visits and festivals,

19:10.290 --> 19:13.590
but I always said no.

19:13.910 --> 19:16.590
Oh, right. You did at first.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.770
To tell you the truth—

19:18.770 --> 19:23.260
You thought you'd get praised for it, right?
 "Oh, how patient. How thoughtful."

19:23.590 --> 19:24.680
You knew?

19:24.680 --> 19:26.460
Of course I did.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.640
How many years do you think 
I've been a granny for?

19:30.100 --> 19:33.800
I can remember it all with my eyes closed.

19:34.010 --> 19:37.150
You're too young to understand,

19:38.080 --> 19:41.520
but raising kids is a funny thing.

19:42.200 --> 19:47.440
If feels like living life over again.

19:49.680 --> 19:53.630
You and Iroha gave me a new lease on life.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.800
Even if you don't share blood...

19:58.900 --> 20:01.920
the people you meet are treasures.

20:06.710 --> 20:10.680
Living for someone who wasn't me...

20:10.950 --> 20:14.600
Well, it was a world of fun.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.230
That's the kind of place this is.

20:22.880 --> 20:28.800
Nio, meet lots of people 
and learn lots of things.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.040
That's what makes a person.

20:34.630 --> 20:38.230
Your granny will die here
 with her memories.

20:38.230 --> 20:39.910
I've set my mind on that.

20:40.180 --> 20:43.710
I can't go off and live somewhere else now.

20:46.960 --> 20:51.560
<i>I knew it. My reason for 
fighting in Kyoto is clear as day.</i>

20:53.210 --> 20:55.230
'Course, I'm not dying anytime soon!

20:55.900 --> 20:57.650
Now, go to sleep.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.310
Okay. Good night.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.600
<i>The people I care about are here.</i>

21:08.330 --> 21:11.540
All right, we've got a full day
 of work ahead of us!

21:11.890 --> 21:14.330
Your extra dango. 
And your apricot-seed jelly.

21:15.090 --> 21:17.040
Th-Thank you for waiting!

21:18.320 --> 21:20.040
<i>Granny's right.</i>

21:23.230 --> 21:25.310
<i>If the people who I meet are my treasures...</i>

21:26.500 --> 21:27.620
Welcome!

21:29.680 --> 21:34.250
<i>then that meeting must have been...</i>

21:38.850 --> 21:41.380
<i>the greatest treasure of my life.</i>

21:44.870 --> 21:49.870
<b>Treasure</b>

23:20.000 --> 23:25.380
<b>Next time</b>

23:21.510 --> 23:22.670
Chirinu Nio here.

23:23.260 --> 23:26.480
Man, it sure feels good to be home.

23:27.050 --> 23:29.850
The smell of cooking dango, 
the well-worn tatami,

23:30.200 --> 23:33.520
and most importantly, 
Granny being her same old self.

23:34.280 --> 23:39.350
I've realized all over again that they
 mean more to me than any treasure.

23:39.910 --> 23:43.520
I guess I'll keep finding more and 
more treasures to care about, huh?

23:45.210 --> 23:47.020
Next time: "The Weakest Shogun."

23:47.030 --> 23:49.870
<b>The
Weakest</b>

23:47.030 --> 23:49.870
<b>Shogun</b>

23:47.580 --> 23:48.570
I won't let you down.
