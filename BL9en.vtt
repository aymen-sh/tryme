07:13.830 --> 07:16.300
<b>How did you manage to score those goals?</b>

07:16.300 --> 07:20.680
<b>You need to carve into your brains

07:21.410 --> 07:24.710
<b>We had plans going into this game.</b>

07:24.710 --> 07:27.690
<b>But they initially didn't work.</b>

07:28.340 --> 07:32.220
<b>The one who made the breakthrough 
was undoubtedly Itoshi Rin.</b>

07:32.520 --> 07:34.980
<b>Helped by Isagi Yoichi.</b>

07:35.820 --> 07:37.940
<b>By playing closer together
 than we trained,</b>

07:37.940 --> 07:40.550
<b>and by having Isagi Yoichi 
around you at all times,</b>

07:40.550 --> 07:43.480
<b>you significantly increased your options.</b>

07:44.110 --> 07:47.020
<b>Itoshi Rin, why did you do that?</b>

07:47.450 --> 07:52.250
<b>To get past their four-man defense, 
I needed a sacrifice.</b>

07:52.760 --> 07:55.160
<b>Isagi happened to fit the role easily.</b>

07:55.160 --> 07:56.870
<b>"Sacrifice," huh?</b>

07:57.180 --> 07:58.580
<b>I like that answer.</b>

07:59.030 --> 08:01.620
<b>Such things don't happen
 on the training field.</b>

08:02.070 --> 08:06.590
<b>In fact, Isagi Yoichi, do you 
think of yourself as a sacrifice?</b>

08:06.820 --> 08:09.670
<b>No. I'm gonna score a goal myself.</b>

08:09.670 --> 08:12.130
<b>Right. That's how you should feel.</b>

08:12.810 --> 08:15.350
<b>All eleven of you out on that field</b>

08:15.350 --> 08:20.560
<b>have egos telling you that you're playing 
the lead role and you must fight this battle.</b>

08:21.390 --> 08:24.570
<b>That's what has got us here.</b>

08:22.110 --> 08:24.570

<b>Japan's U-20s vs. Blue Lock</b>

08:22.110 --> 08:24.570
<b>First Half 
Over</b>

08:24.970 --> 08:28.730
<b>However, that doesn't mean 
the second half will go the same way.</b>

08:28.730 --> 08:31.420
<b>Or rather, we <i>know</i> it won't.</b>

08:31.780 --> 08:35.860
<b>So stop celebrating and getting 
carried away right this second.</b>

08:37.000 --> 08:39.920
<b>You've achieved nothing yet.</b>

08:41.130 --> 08:44.080
<b>Don't be satisfied. Keep on attacking.</b>

08:44.490 --> 08:49.180
<b>Refuse to relinquish your right to be 
in the lead role until the very last second.</b>

08:50.010 --> 08:50.830
<b>That's all.</b>

08:51.430 --> 08:53.130
<b>We won't change formation.</b>

08:54.990 --> 08:57.260
<b>I only have one instruction 
for the second half.</b>

08:58.000 --> 08:59.500
<b>Make it a rout.</b>

09:01.130 --> 09:02.260
<b><i>That's right.</i></b>

09:02.650 --> 09:06.560
<b><i>We're not playing this 
just so we can win together.</i></b>

09:07.130 --> 09:09.540
<b><i>I need to keep battling for my own goals.</i></b>

09:10.030 --> 09:12.780
<b><i>And just like how he's doing it his way...</i></b>

09:13.910 --> 09:17.120
<b><i>I will prove myself in this game.</i></b>

09:18.490 --> 09:21.940
<b>Crap, crap, crap.</b>

09:21.940 --> 09:24.200
<b>Never thought we'd let 'em take the lead.</b>

09:24.530 --> 09:26.540
<b>What are we gonna do in the second half?</b>

09:27.130 --> 09:28.920
<b>If only I'd scored...</b>

09:29.820 --> 09:32.250
<b>Perfect timing, Genius.</b>

09:32.250 --> 09:34.510
<b>We're discussing changes
 for the second half.</b>

09:34.510 --> 09:37.760
<b>That last attack in 
the first half almost came off.</b>

09:37.760 --> 09:40.300
<b>They'll freak out if we commit
 more men to the attack.</b>

09:40.860 --> 09:42.850
<b>Should we request a tweak of formation?</b>

09:42.850 --> 09:45.240
<b>Huh? Do what you like.</b>

09:45.240 --> 09:46.730
<b>It's not my problem anymore.</b>

09:46.730 --> 09:49.440
<b>Huh? What are you talking about?</b>

09:51.690 --> 09:52.890
<b>I'm leaving.</b>

09:53.400 --> 09:55.850
<b>Huh? What do you mean by <i>that</i>?!</b>

<b>Without you, there's no game.</b>

09:58.250 --> 10:00.030
<b>He's moisturizing his face?</b>

10:00.030 --> 10:04.630
<b>I don't care. Those were the terms of 
the bet with your captain over there.</b>

10:05.250 --> 10:07.080
<b>A bet with Aiku?</b>

10:07.130 --> 10:10.130
<b>Let us win without Shidou.</b>

10:10.170 --> 10:12.590
<b>I'll be the one testing you.</b>

10:12.850 --> 10:16.640
<b>If you can't keep up with me, I'm out.</b>

10:17.650 --> 10:20.820

10:20.820 --> 10:22.430
<b>That's the reality.</b>

10:23.070 --> 10:27.460
<b>Still, I only came here because

10:28.680 --> 10:31.020
<b>They're still crude,</b>

10:31.020 --> 10:35.120
<b>but it's clear what they're seeing and 
aiming for is totally different from you.</b>

10:36.520 --> 10:39.130
<b>That's all I needed to know.</b>

10:40.370 --> 10:42.870
<b>I have no reason to stay here any longer.</b>

10:44.200 --> 10:46.210
<b>Hold on, Li'l Genius.</b>

10:47.790 --> 10:51.230
<b>Sorry, guys. I made a very selfish bet.</b>

10:51.990 --> 10:55.670
<b>I wanted to test the skills we have now.</b>

10:56.520 --> 11:00.380
<b>And I wanted to see where I stood.</b>

11:01.340 --> 11:03.560
<b>But it's painfully clear now.</b>

11:04.410 --> 11:05.390
<b>We are...</b>

11:06.600 --> 11:07.620
<b>weak.</b>

11:11.050 --> 11:17.900
<b>At this rate, the U-20s will be taken over,

11:20.380 --> 11:25.150
<b>It burns and stings worse than

<b>Rin, what do you think about

13:26.890 --> 13:29.120
<b>Huh? Nothing really.</b>

13:29.670 --> 13:31.840
<b>I just think about scoring, I guess.</b>

13:32.180 --> 13:35.830
<b>I know you'll pass the ball to me
 if I run into a hot spot.</b>

13:36.330 --> 13:38.000
<b>What do you mean by a "hot spot"?</b>

13:38.280 --> 13:42.960
<b>Um... Those places where 
the enemy panics and breaks down.</b>

13:45.690 --> 13:48.830
<b>You rely on your gut too much.</b>

13:48.830 --> 13:51.930
<b>But you pass the ball to me, 
so it's all good, right?</b>

13:51.930 --> 13:54.890
<b>Playing with other guys 
just doesn't feel satisfying.</b>

13:55.360 --> 13:58.600
<b>What are you gonna do 
when I'm not around?</b>

13:58.600 --> 14:02.190
<b>I don't know, but I guess 
I'll find a replacement.</b>

14:02.190 --> 14:04.530
<b>As if you could replace me.</b>

14:04.530 --> 14:06.200
<b>Who do you think I am?</b>

14:06.200 --> 14:07.070
<b>Ouch.</b>

14:07.330 --> 14:12.030
<b>Yeah, okay, fine, oh great Itoshi Sae,
 the best in the world.</b>

14:13.560 --> 14:16.840
<b>Rin. I'm leaving for Spain tomorrow.</b>

14:17.260 --> 14:21.380
<b>I'm going to be joining the academy of 
the best soccer club in the world, Royale.</b>

14:22.000 --> 14:23.750
<b>Why so formal all of a sudden?</b>

14:24.070 --> 14:25.090
<b>I know that.</b>

14:25.780 --> 14:28.800
<b>You're going to be the 
best striker in the world, right?</b>

14:29.130 --> 14:32.430
<b>I'm just going there before you. 
You'd better catch up soon.</b>

14:33.900 --> 14:36.980
<b>While I'm gone, don't you dare give up.</b>

14:37.480 --> 14:38.460
<b>Right.</b>

14:38.920 --> 14:43.440
<b>For now, my goal is to be the best 
in Japan and get scouted like you.</b>

14:43.440 --> 14:45.890
<b>Yeah. Then onto the world stage.</b>

14:46.360 --> 14:48.740
<b>We'll become the best in the world together.</b>

14:51.610 --> 14:53.370
<b><i>Honestly, I'm a little sad.</i></b>

14:54.330 --> 14:56.170
<b><i>But I'll make sure I catch up to him.</i></b>

14:56.830 --> 14:58.790
<b>Big Bro, take care.</b>

14:59.030 --> 15:00.370
<b>I'm off.</b>

15:00.370 --> 15:02.790
<b>To become the best striker in the world.</b>

15:04.790 --> 15:07.610
<b><i>Next time I see him, I want...</i></b>

15:09.210 --> 15:12.180
<b><i>to be someone who can 
fight on the world stage.</i></b>

15:13.280 --> 15:16.890
<b><i>Playing soccer without my big bro 
is confining and awkward, but...</i></b>

15:16.890 --> 15:17.850
<b>Pass it, Rin!</b>

15:17.850 --> 15:18.770
<b>Rin, over here!</b>

15:18.770 --> 15:19.770
<b>Gimme the ball!</b>

15:20.720 --> 15:22.990
<b><i>I need to ascend to my bro's level.</i></b>

15:23.710 --> 15:25.940
<b><i>Now that this team has lost my big bro,</i></b>

15:27.660 --> 15:31.780
<b><i>I'll make it the best in Japan in his place.</i></b>

15:34.760 --> 15:36.800
<b>Heya. Practicing late again?</b>

15:36.800 --> 15:37.530
<b>Yeah.</b>

15:37.530 --> 15:40.170
<b>It's freezing! I'm heading home, Rin.</b>

15:47.050 --> 15:49.110
<b>Oh. Snow.</b>

15:51.380 --> 15:54.340
<b>The line of that shot wasn't tight enough.</b>

15:54.650 --> 15:56.300
<b>Oh, Big Bro—</b>

16:02.420 --> 16:03.620
<b>Welcome home.</b>

16:04.530 --> 16:06.840
<b>Yeah. I'm back.</b>

16:08.330 --> 16:10.170
<b>I see you in the news all the time.</b>

16:10.680 --> 16:13.860
<b>You've played in Royale's 
academy games, scored goals...</b>

16:13.860 --> 16:15.490
<b>You're awesome.</b>

16:21.360 --> 16:23.810
<b>There are people more awesome 
than me out there.</b>

16:25.320 --> 16:27.380
<b>Where's this coming from?</b>

16:28.990 --> 16:31.090
<b>I've updated my dream.</b>

16:31.910 --> 16:34.880
<b>I'm going to be the best 
midfielder in the world.</b>

16:36.180 --> 16:36.850
<b>Huh?</b>

16:37.760 --> 16:39.160
<b>"Striker," you mean.</b>

16:39.800 --> 16:42.850
<b>There's no point in becoming 
the best <i>midfielder</i> in the world—</b>

16:42.850 --> 16:43.960
<b>Shut up.</b>

16:44.480 --> 16:47.360
<b>Only someone who's never been 
out into the world would say that.</b>

16:47.810 --> 16:49.320
<b>What's this about?</b>

16:49.710 --> 16:53.570
<b>You said we'd fight together. That I should
 become the second-best after you.</b>

16:53.570 --> 16:59.240
<b>Right. So I'll be the best midfielder, 
and you can be the best striker in the world—</b>

16:59.240 --> 17:02.330
<b>I'm the <i>little brother</i> of 
the best striker in the world!</b>

17:04.290 --> 17:08.190
<b>Did you come back just 
to tell me something so lame?</b>

17:08.750 --> 17:10.750
<b>I don't want to see you like this.</b>

17:11.630 --> 17:12.390
<b>I...</b>

17:12.840 --> 17:16.330
<b>You aren't the big bro 
I shared my dream with.</b>

17:21.250 --> 17:22.820
<b>I see now.</b>

17:24.960 --> 17:26.170
<b>We're half-baked.</b>

17:27.400 --> 17:30.440
<b>You and me both.</b>

17:31.830 --> 17:33.370
<b>What do you mean?</b>

17:34.690 --> 17:40.080
<b>If you can beat me one-on-one, 
I'll share that dream with you once more.</b>

17:40.520 --> 17:45.360
<b>But if I win, our dream ends here.</b>

17:46.330 --> 17:49.670
<b>No. You don't get to decide that, Big Bro.</b>

17:50.060 --> 17:52.230
<b>I don't want to play a game like this—</b>

17:52.930 --> 17:54.670
<b>You ready, Rin?</b>

17:58.190 --> 18:00.100
<b>This is a one-shot match.</b>

18:02.970 --> 18:03.850
<b><i>So fast.</i></b>

18:05.270 --> 18:07.370
<b><i>He's on a different level 
than when he was here.</i></b>

18:07.850 --> 18:10.010
<b><i>But I'm not letting you go.</i></b>

18:19.450 --> 18:23.160
<b><i>This is where he is right now?</i></b>

18:24.930 --> 18:25.810
<b><i>Why?</i></b>

18:27.070 --> 18:28.020
<b><i>Big Bro!</i></b>

18:29.930 --> 18:33.130
<b>Rin, in the four years I've been away...</b>

18:39.110 --> 18:42.800
<b>...what have you been doing here?</b>

18:54.300 --> 18:55.570
<b>It's over.</b>

18:58.150 --> 18:59.660
<b>Hold on, Big Bro.</b>

19:01.010 --> 19:04.740
<b>After you left, I worked really hard.</b>

19:05.070 --> 19:09.180
<b>I did so to become the best in Japan
 and get scouted like you.</b>

19:10.010 --> 19:11.980
<b>So that I could be your replacement.</b>

19:12.510 --> 19:17.770
<b>I fought hard for the team and 
became the best in Japan like I promised.</b>

19:18.130 --> 19:20.850
<b>And now, it's over, just like that?</b>

19:22.450 --> 19:25.610
<b>If I can't chase my dream with you, then...</b>

19:27.260 --> 19:30.200
<b>I've got no reason to play soccer anymore.</b>

19:33.770 --> 19:35.370
<b>Then quit.</b>

19:41.170 --> 19:43.180
<b>Screw that "best in Japan" shit.</b>

19:43.910 --> 19:46.120
<b>Screw that "your replacement" shit.</b>

19:48.440 --> 19:50.410
<b>It makes me wanna hurl.</b>

19:51.200 --> 19:54.830
<b>Don't ever use me as 
an excuse to play soccer.</b>

19:55.660 --> 20:00.470
<b>To me, you're nothing but a nuisance.
Just a little brother who's a pain in the neck.</b>

20:01.430 --> 20:04.180
<b>You have no value.</b>

20:05.610 --> 20:06.880
<b>Get lost, Rin.</b>

20:07.670 --> 20:10.850
<b>I don't need you in my life anymore.</b>

20:12.410 --> 20:13.520
<b>Big Bro...</b>

20:19.620 --> 20:21.950
<b><i>I'm done with soccer.</i></b>

20:22.490 --> 20:26.450
<b><i>After all, I only ever did it
 to be near my big bro.</i></b>

20:27.660 --> 20:33.600
<b><i>But to him, I was only a trial horse 
to becoming the best in the world.</i></b>

20:34.730 --> 20:38.280
<b><i>Now that he's done with me, I have no value.</i></b>

20:39.520 --> 20:41.340
<b><i>The big bro I knew...</i></b>

20:43.210 --> 20:45.660
<b><i>All of it was a lie.</i></b>

20:47.260 --> 20:49.470
<b>We'll become the best in the world together.</b>

21:01.450 --> 21:03.660
<b><i>No. No.</i></b>

21:03.660 --> 21:05.490
<b><i>No, no, no!</i></b>

21:06.720 --> 21:09.410
<b><i>Those feelings... Those times we shared...</i></b>

21:10.070 --> 21:12.300
<b><i>I can't pretend they didn't happen.</i></b>

21:13.740 --> 21:15.370
<b><i>They weren't lies!</i></b>

21:17.080 --> 21:20.210
<b>I'll kill him. He'll pay for this.</b>

21:24.890 --> 21:25.810

21:26.470 --> 21:27.840
<b>The second half's starting.</b>

21:28.300 --> 21:28.970

21:31.850 --> 21:34.280
<b><i>To shatter Itoshi Sae's dream...</i></b>

21:35.140 --> 21:36.840

21:42.090 --> 21:44.020
<b>Tsk. What a pain.</b>

21:44.590 --> 21:48.290
<b>I knew that antenna-head would come on.</b>

21:50.720 --> 21:53.410
<b>How should we deal with it, Ego-san?</b>

21:53.410 --> 21:55.880
<b>I'm not changing our formation.</b>

21:56.280 --> 21:59.500
<b>We've practiced anti-Shidou Ryusei measures.</b>

21:59.810 --> 22:02.250
<b>We won't let him unsettle us,</b>

22:02.250 --> 22:06.220
<b>and it's not like their purely 
decorative manager can handle him.</b>

22:06.460 --> 22:08.180
<b>What interests me more...</b>

22:08.620 --> 22:13.140
<b>is why he wanted Shidou Ryusei, 
when even we couldn't tame him.</b>

22:14.010 --> 22:17.850
<b>Let's see what Itoshi Sae's
 idea of an egoist is.</b>

22:18.340 --> 22:22.210
