00:22.420 --> 00:23.950
<b><i>That pass of his.</i></b>

00:24.560 --> 00:26.170
<b><i>That idiot's movement.</i></b>

00:27.000 --> 00:29.550
<b><i>And that block by Itoshi Sae.</i></b>

00:31.200 --> 00:35.930
<b><i>Without me realizing, this game
has started revolving around Isagi.</i></b>

00:38.100 --> 00:40.340
<b><i>I'm not gonna let him gobble it all up.</i></b>

00:41.770 --> 00:44.810
<b><i>Blue Lock's core is undoubtedly Rin.</i></b>

00:45.430 --> 00:50.600
<b><i>That goal earlier was possible because 
Rin was on the field as our guiding light.</i></b>

00:51.740 --> 00:56.270
<b><i>With Rin there, I could move more freely 
and switch to my new challenge.</i></b>

00:57.280 --> 01:03.120
<b><i>Anyway, that goal was a successful 
one-time thing with low reproducibility.</i></b>

01:03.950 --> 01:07.900
<b><i>If we mistakenly believe we can do 
the same again, it'll be game over.</i></b>

01:10.090 --> 01:13.510
<b><i>What we need to reproduce isn't 
the shot that hit the back of the net.</i></b>

01:13.510 --> 01:15.630
<b><i>It's the "trance chain" phenomenon.</i></b>

01:16.440 --> 01:22.350
<b><i>We each face our own challenge, 
and the interplay results in a goal.</i></b>

01:22.930 --> 01:26.600
<b><i>It's a difficult phenomenon to pull off,
 but if we can do it, we win.</i></b>

01:28.400 --> 01:29.480
<b><i>Damn it.</i></b>

01:30.250 --> 01:32.400
<b><i>I'll score the next goal.</i></b>

01:35.100 --> 01:36.780
<b><i>I'll outdo myself.</i></b>

01:37.170 --> 01:38.740
<b><i>I'll devour him, and...</i></b>

01:39.060 --> 01:40.700
<b><i>I'll devour him, and...</i></b>

01:42.820 --> 01:44.610
<b><i>I'll become the leading man!</i></b>

01:45.540 --> 01:47.670
<b>I'm totally buzzing.</b>

01:47.900 --> 01:49.290
<b>'Kay. All ready to go.</b>

01:49.570 --> 01:50.870
<b><i>I</i> will...</b>

01:50.870 --> 01:51.880
<b>...protect the goal.</b>

01:52.150 --> 01:53.520
<b>We'll force an openin'.</b>

01:53.520 --> 01:55.210
<b>Sure. I'll follow yer lead.</b>

01:57.170 --> 01:58.800
<b>There's 15 minutes left.</b>

01:59.320 --> 02:00.600
<b>One more goal.</b>

02:02.340 --> 02:04.720
<b>It's getting hot over there, huh? Damn.</b>

02:05.250 --> 02:07.270
<b>Stop overshadowing me.</b>

02:08.510 --> 02:10.400
<b>Lemme climax, genius.</b>

02:10.400 --> 02:12.510
<b>Time to fly, devil.</b>

02:13.360 --> 02:19.830
<b>Japan's U-20s vs. Blue Lock</b>

02:13.780 --> 02:15.530
<b><i>This game's really hotting up.</i></b>

02:15.530 --> 02:19.820
<b><i>It's end-to-end stuff between 
Japan's U-20s and the Blue Lock XI.</i></b>

02:20.400 --> 02:22.790
<b><i>We're into the final phase

03:56.600 --> 04:00.020
<b>Episode</b>

03:57.180 --> 04:00.020
<b>Not Alone</b>

04:04.280 --> 04:06.900
<b><i>Everything begins with Itoshi Sae's pass.</i></b>

04:07.210 --> 04:10.350
<b><i>We need to watch out for
where the pass is going.</i></b>

04:11.760 --> 04:12.540
<b>Isagi!</b>

04:12.540 --> 04:14.190
<b>Huh? He's dribbling?</b>

04:14.610 --> 04:16.650
<b>I'm taking this game to the next level.</b>

04:17.770 --> 04:22.780
<b>Only the idiots who can keep up with me
 will get to see what comes next.</b>

04:31.000 --> 04:32.580
<b><i>A hyper-technical nutmeg?</i></b>

04:33.530 --> 04:35.040
<b><i>And now he's speeding up?</i></b>

04:35.630 --> 04:38.540
<b><i>He's raised his own game 
to match the level of the field.</i></b>

04:39.330 --> 04:41.460
<b><i>That means he wasn't serious before.</i></b>

04:42.330 --> 04:44.410
<b><i>Just how high do his parameters go?</i></b>

04:48.220 --> 04:51.560
<b>Look at that! Itoshi Sae 
goes on a solo run upfield!</b>

04:51.560 --> 04:53.770
<b>Crap. Put more men on him and stop him!</b>

04:53.770 --> 04:56.710
<b>Pipe down, Money-leon. We're doing that!</b>

04:58.070 --> 04:59.900
<b><i>Damn it. Damn it!</i></b>

05:01.650 --> 05:03.070
<b><i>Damn you!</i></b>

05:07.370 --> 05:09.740
<b><i>Just how far ahead of me are you?</i></b>

05:10.820 --> 05:13.260
<b><i>I know we used to be shoulder to shoulder.</i></b>

05:13.870 --> 05:16.030
<b><i>We had a real connection.</i></b>

05:17.310 --> 05:21.380
<b><i>But you're always leaving me behind.</i></b>

05:22.530 --> 05:24.350
<b><i>It's that same old feeling.</i></b>

05:26.210 --> 05:29.140
<b><i>I'm slowly sinking into blurriness.</i></b>

05:30.050 --> 05:31.770
<b><i>Damn it.</i></b>

05:32.980 --> 05:34.520
<b><i>I'm sick of this.</i></b>

05:35.540 --> 05:37.980
<b><i>This lukewarm tragedy.</i></b>

05:39.700 --> 05:40.730
<b><i>That's the past...</i></b>

05:42.990 --> 05:45.110
<b><i>that I crushed long ago!</i></b>

05:45.780 --> 05:47.270
<b><i>Destroy it.</i></b>

05:47.270 --> 05:49.480
<b><i>I'm gonna change in this match.</i></b>

05:49.900 --> 05:51.570
<b><i>We're brothers.</i></b>

05:51.570 --> 05:52.950
<b><i>We have the same blood.</i></b>

05:53.560 --> 05:56.160
<b><i>If he can do it, so can I.</i></b>

05:57.010 --> 05:58.590
<b><i>Synchronize with him.</i></b>

05:58.590 --> 06:02.750
<b><i>If I were Itoshi Sae, 
how would I destroy Blue Lock?</i></b>

06:02.750 --> 06:04.350
<b>Yukimiya, cover him!</b>

06:04.350 --> 06:05.380
<b>Yeah, I got it!</b>

06:06.970 --> 06:08.800
<b><i>Natural-born dribblers...</i></b>

06:09.380 --> 06:12.100
<b><i>are active, with their 
dribbling self-started.</i></b>

06:12.140 --> 06:15.060
<b><i>Itoshi Sae's dribbling, 
on the other hand, is passive,</i></b>

06:15.060 --> 06:17.820
<b><i>relying on reading the opponent's
 rhythm and movement...</i></b>

06:19.220 --> 06:21.610
<b><i>and going the opposite way.</i></b>

06:22.650 --> 06:26.460
<b><i>It's a counter-dribbling 
that flows and evades.</i></b>

06:26.820 --> 06:28.110
<b>Nice, genius!</b>

06:28.110 --> 06:29.030
<b>Let's all press up!</b>

06:30.110 --> 06:32.500
<b><i>Before I started playing myself,</i></b>

06:33.360 --> 06:38.210
<b><i>I used to admire Itoshi Sae's
 soccer philosophy.</i></b>

06:38.910 --> 06:43.080
<b><i>He uses logic to quickly shrug off 
the enemy with minimal fuss,</i></b>

06:43.080 --> 06:45.960
<b><i>then calculates how to score
 the optimal goal.</i></b>

06:47.490 --> 06:51.970
<b><i>The essence of Itoshi Sae's soccer 
is the act of beautiful destruction.</i></b>

06:51.970 --> 06:54.010
<b>Are ya for real?</b>

06:54.010 --> 06:55.760
<b>He's gonna do it all by himself?</b>

06:56.350 --> 07:03.860
<b><i>That's why he's looking for an answer 
no one's found yet: an incalculable egoist.</i></b>

07:06.430 --> 07:09.610
<b><i>That's why he chose Shidou over me.</i></b>

07:10.810 --> 07:19.880
<b><i>To guide the talent of that devil striker,
and become the best midfielder out there.</i></b>

07:20.740 --> 07:23.590
<b><i>Where is it? What would 
I do if I were Itoshi Sae?</i></b>

07:24.310 --> 07:25.800
<b><i>If I were Itoshi Sae...</i></b>

07:27.090 --> 07:28.810
<b><i>how would I want to play?</i></b>

07:29.910 --> 07:31.970
<b><i>What goal would I want to score?</i></b>

07:33.020 --> 07:36.130
<b><i>What would I desire from this moment?</i></b>

07:37.680 --> 07:39.440
<b><i>He's still dribbling?</i></b>

07:39.440 --> 07:40.480
<b><i>Inside? Or outside?</i></b>

07:42.440 --> 07:44.020
<b><i>A shot? No, it isn't.</i></b>

07:47.140 --> 07:48.980
<b><i>A cross to Shidou?</i></b>

07:48.980 --> 07:50.930
<b><i>So you </i>did<i> choose to pass.</i></b>

07:50.930 --> 07:55.910
<b><i>Plus, it's a perfectly calculated place
 to shoot from that only Shidou can reach.</i></b>

07:56.220 --> 08:00.860
<b><i>Once Itoshi Sae is let off the leash, 
no one can stop him.</i></b>

08:03.860 --> 08:06.280
<b><i>The most beautiful spot is right here.</i></b>

08:07.060 --> 08:09.420
<b><i>Right, you poor excuse for a brother?</i></b>

08:14.340 --> 08:15.900
<b>Whoa! He stopped it!</b>

08:15.900 --> 08:18.210
<b>But he also took a kick to the face!</b>

08:18.210 --> 08:19.830
<b>That's <i>gotta</i> be a yellow!</b>

08:19.830 --> 08:22.680
<b>It was unintentional. 
It's Blue Lock's ball to restart.</b>

08:22.680 --> 08:25.630
<b>Tch. You long bottom-lashed idiot.</b>

08:26.750 --> 08:28.270
<b>Ya feelin' dizzy?</b>

08:28.270 --> 08:30.620
<b>I'm fine. He grazed me, that's all.</b>

08:28.910 --> 08:32.280
<b><i>That was totally unlike the Rin I know.</i></b>

08:33.790 --> 08:36.770
<b><i>He's usually all about number one,
 but in that moment,</i></b>

08:37.090 --> 08:41.470
<b><i>it was like he ran to that spot and 
sacrificed himself to protect the goal.</i></b>

08:42.890 --> 08:47.630
<b><i>Did he change his play style at the very 
last minute just to shut down Itoshi Sae?</i></b>

08:49.810 --> 08:51.620
<b><i>He's incredible.</i></b>

08:53.630 --> 08:58.430
<b><i>Each of us tried to enter the "flow," and 
as a result, the level of this game went up.</i></b>

08:58.760 --> 09:05.510
<b><i>In response, Sae raised the bar, 
which then awoke something inside Rin.</i></b>

09:07.430 --> 09:11.390
<b><i>Now Rin's becoming someone 
who can kill Itoshi Sae.</i></b>

09:12.680 --> 09:14.900
<b><i>Rin is changing.</i></b>

09:18.030 --> 09:22.170
<b>Hey, bros. Shouldn't you 
be paying more attention?</b>

09:22.170 --> 09:23.370
<b>Oh, crap.</b>

09:24.890 --> 09:27.730
<b>One express train 
right through the middle!</b>

09:27.730 --> 09:29.040
<b>A long pass?</b>

09:29.040 --> 09:32.000
<b>Skipping all local stops.</b>

09:32.410 --> 09:35.630
<b>Departing from Mikage Reo,
 via Nagi Seishiro...</b>

09:35.630 --> 09:37.320
<b>...and bound for the goal area.</b>

09:37.730 --> 09:40.950
<b>Meet me at the destination, strikers.</b>

09:42.050 --> 09:46.890
<b><i>If Rin can take out Sae, then my combos, 
my vision, and everything else will change.</i></b>

09:48.700 --> 09:50.230
<b><i>It'll be a new landscape.</i></b>

09:51.910 --> 09:54.570
<b><i>Starting with Rin, 
everything will be reborn.</i></b>

09:55.670 --> 09:57.620
<b><i>Blue Lock can evolve even more.</i></b>

09:58.290 --> 09:59.290
<b><i>Imagine it.</i></b>

10:00.260 --> 10:02.250
<b><i>Imagine an attack only we can create...</i></b>

10:03.360 --> 10:05.510
<b><i>in this phase of the trance state cycle.</i></b>

10:08.010 --> 10:10.330
<b>You called, egoist?</b>

10:12.140 --> 10:14.320
<b>The monster has arrived.</b>

10:13.820 --> 10:18.070
<b>Blue Lock XI</b>

10:14.320 --> 10:16.940
<b>The last piece is me, right?</b>

10:18.540 --> 10:20.800
<b>The last piece is me, right?</b>

10:21.170 --> 10:23.760
<b>Good positioning, Bachira.</b>

10:23.760 --> 10:26.530
<b>I'm not doing this to support you, Isagi.</b>

10:26.530 --> 10:29.230
<b>I came here to score a goal myself.</b>

10:30.150 --> 10:32.040
<b>Right back at ya.</b>

10:32.510 --> 10:34.410
<b>Go ahead and try it, monster.</b>

10:34.410 --> 10:36.990
<b>Back off, egoist.</b>

10:36.990 --> 10:40.360
<b>Here's our chance to counter.</b>

10:40.870 --> 10:42.640
<b><i>Rin's still behind us.</i></b>

10:42.640 --> 10:45.340
<b><i>Bachira has now been 
added as an attack piece.</i></b>

10:47.480 --> 10:51.790
<b><i>In this new formation, I need
to pull off a trance state chain.</i></b>

10:52.650 --> 10:53.630
<b><i>First, midfield.</i></b>

10:54.710 --> 10:56.460
<b><i>Can you keep up with us?</i></b>

10:56.460 --> 10:59.630
<b>How many attacking options 
do you have, Blue Lock?</b>

10:59.990 --> 11:02.560
<b><i>With Bachira, this bit is easy.</i></b>

11:02.560 --> 11:04.600
<b><i>The problem starts here.</i></b>

11:05.070 --> 11:07.310
<b>The King is back!</b>

11:07.310 --> 11:12.270
<b>You let your guard down, Isagi. Did you think
 I wouldn't come for you so far from the goal?</b>

11:12.930 --> 11:15.730
<b>Don't screw with me!
 I won't let you steal it, King Crap!</b>

11:15.730 --> 11:17.450
<b>Knock it off, you idiots!</b>

11:17.450 --> 11:19.070
<b>Reo gave you the ball to—</b>

11:20.150 --> 11:21.800
<b>This is a counterattack.</b>

11:21.800 --> 11:23.800
<b>Stop taking forever, donkeys.</b>

11:24.160 --> 11:25.370
<b>Bachira?</b>

11:26.190 --> 11:28.680
<b>It's my turn again at last.</b>

11:32.860 --> 11:37.250
<b><i>I'll give into my impulses 
and let my dribbling feet dance.</i></b>

11:37.700 --> 11:39.210
<b><i>Intuition. Improvisation.</i></b>

11:40.300 --> 11:42.430
<b><i>I'll empty my mind and just play.</i></b>

11:45.330 --> 11:47.850
<b><i>I'll go to wherever my heart feels joy!</i></b>

11:47.850 --> 11:49.170
<b><i>What fast feet!</i></b>

11:49.170 --> 11:50.560
<b><i>A feint? A turn?</i></b>

11:51.480 --> 11:52.690
<b><i>It's a nutmeg!</i></b>

11:53.070 --> 11:55.270
<b><i>No, wait. He lifted it?</i></b>

11:55.640 --> 11:59.360
<b><i>Let's go bang-bang. 
Then it's shwiff, and turn and zwoop.</i></b>

11:59.360 --> 12:01.570
<b>Keep on him, Neru! Press!</b>

12:01.570 --> 12:03.030
<b><i>Oh, it's Beardy.</i></b>

12:03.030 --> 12:03.870
<b>Pincer him!</b>

12:03.870 --> 12:05.030
<b>Okay, let's get him!</b>

12:05.590 --> 12:07.060
<b><i>And zip.</i></b>

12:09.160 --> 12:10.620
<b><i>Spin, spin.</i></b>

12:11.400 --> 12:12.830
<b><i>Nyah, nyah, nyah!</i></b>

12:13.220 --> 12:14.710
<b>What's the deal with this guy?</b>

12:14.710 --> 12:16.790
<b>Is he a natural-born dribbler?</b>

12:17.060 --> 12:20.130
<b><i>A fake roulette! 
Bachira Meguru weaves in and out!</i></b>

12:21.260 --> 12:22.380
<b>Huh?</b>

12:22.910 --> 12:25.590
<b>So you had another blade up your sleeve, huh?</b>

12:25.590 --> 12:26.740
<b>Gyaos!</b>

12:27.250 --> 12:28.220
<b>Bachira!</b>

12:28.220 --> 12:29.320
<b>Look at me!</b>

12:29.320 --> 12:30.270
<b>Over here!</b>

12:30.270 --> 12:32.600
<b><i>Shut up, you NPCs.</i></b>

12:36.200 --> 12:37.860
<b><i>Scissors and crazy fakes?</i></b>

12:38.610 --> 12:43.570
<b><i>You egoists are all about dribbling 
98% of the time, and passing only 2%.</i></b>

12:43.570 --> 12:44.990
<b><i>So bring it.</i></b>

12:46.690 --> 12:49.100
<b><i>Into a shooting motion at this distance?</i></b>

12:49.700 --> 12:50.460
<b><i>That's...</i></b>

12:51.240 --> 12:52.410
<b><i>what you think.</i></b>

12:53.480 --> 12:56.850
<b><i>Smash Monster Lift!</i></b>

12:57.900 --> 12:59.840
<b><i>What the heck is that technique?</i></b>

12:59.840 --> 13:01.090
<b>Come out, goalie!</b>

13:03.560 --> 13:07.560
<b><i>This is me concentrating
 on a daring challenge.</i></b>

13:09.160 --> 13:10.810
<b><i>My Monster Trance!</i></b>

13:12.850 --> 13:14.140
<b>Boom.</b>

13:15.240 --> 13:16.250
<b><i>That's a goa—</i></b>

13:18.960 --> 13:22.690
<b>Japan's U-20s</b>

13:19.190 --> 13:22.690
<b>This is what you meant, right, Aiku?</b>

13:23.110 --> 13:27.390
<b>The stronger his foe, 
the more fired up the star player gets.</b>

13:30.450 --> 13:32.620
<b>So rail against the world!</b>

13:34.500 --> 13:35.860
<b>Sendou?</b>

13:36.850 --> 13:39.480
<b><i>A-A goal-line clearance 
by their star player!</i></b>

13:39.480 --> 13:40.630
<b><i>Sendou!</i></b>
