00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.970
Then let's play ice hockey!

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.929
Inside Out 2

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.971
You heard Joy there reporting
straight from Riley's mind-

00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:36.971
- and we're expecting a great
fight here today with the Fog Horns.

00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:42.929
Riley fans, get up from your
seats and make some noise!

00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:43.929
Come on!

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:45.929
Come on, Misty Horn!

00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:49.971
Get in with the paws!
Foghorn is number three.

00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:51.971
- One two three!
- Fog!

00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:04.972
And now it's time to
meet your Tim Riley!

00:02:04.972 --> 00:02:09.972
He is playing in his 13th year and will come
straight from the penalty box: Riley's Wrath!

00:02:09.972 --> 00:02:11.972
Let me skin him!

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.973
Helmet, visor, gloves.
Security check completed.

00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:25.973
Everything went smoothly from...

00:02:25.973 --> 00:02:26.973
Watch out!

00:02:28.973 --> 00:02:30.973
It was Fear, which
kept Riley alert.

00:02:30.973 --> 00:02:32.973
We need mouth guards, people.

00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:37.973
No, no, no!  It's not ours!

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:41.973
And that's the famous Disgust.
Great, we have him on the team.

00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:47.932
- 28, Anderson.  Leg span.
- Oh no.

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:50.974
And the raisins at the end of
the sausage, you know and love him-

00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:53.974
- incomparable...

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:55.974
We got an expulsion.

00:02:55.974 --> 00:02:58.974
Appropriate!  It's
sad to be home!

00:02:58.974 --> 00:02:59.974
Yay.

00:03:00.974 --> 00:03:03.974
Andersen got two minutes
in the leg span box.

00:03:03.974 --> 00:03:07.933
We have a few minutes,
as Riley sighs.

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:11.975
I'll keep you posted.
Riley is still amazing.

00:03:12.975 --> 00:03:13.975
nice.

00:03:13.975 --> 00:03:17.975
Not just because he's the
best in class, and he is.

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:19.975
Riley, look here!

00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:25.934
He is also very sweet and
caring for street cats.  Frankly!

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:30.975
And now he is officially a teenager.
He got very tall very quickly.

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:35.976
- Have we grown overnight?
- That's our favorite blouse.

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:38.976
We even got braces
with elastics!

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:40.976
- How does it feel?
- Cold!

00:03:40.976 --> 00:03:41.976
Excuse me.

00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:45.976
Riley's Island of
Personality is in full force.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:48.976
Although Boybandøen
was destroyed.

00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:50.976
But Fjolleøen is
still causing problems.

00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:54.976
- Wait, where is Family Island?
- There.

00:03:55.977 --> 00:03:57.935
Yes, that's him.

00:03:57.977 --> 00:04:02.977
- What's looming over him?
- Friendship Island.  Isn't that beautiful?

00:04:02.977 --> 00:04:06.977
But we've discovered that he's a
memory of not just the lowly island.

00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:12.936
Getting to the roots
memories also create value.

00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:14.936
Homework should be banned.

00:04:15.977 --> 00:04:18.977
Rise and Shine is the
best band in the world!

00:04:18.977 --> 00:04:22.978
- And my personal favorite...
- I'm a very good friend.

00:04:22.978 --> 00:04:27.978
Did you know that the coins on
your sofa can change the world?

00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:36.978
- We have to do something.
- NO.  The girl is a social Titanic.

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:38.978
Friends...

00:04:41.978 --> 00:04:43.979
How beautiful it is.

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.979
Everything is alright.  I
lose too all the time something.

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.979
- My name is Riley.
- My name is Grace.

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.979
My name is Bree.

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.938
When you put all the values ​​together,
they create something beautiful.

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:07.980
Self-Conception.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.980
- I am a good person.
- That makes Riley make a good choice.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.980
13 years of hard work gathered into
what some would call our masterpiece.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.980
Biggest challenge...

00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:24.980
- Geez!  We have to fight again.
- That's right.

00:05:25.022 --> 00:05:27.980
- How do we score goals?
- With our shots!

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.981
- No, we are rushing towards the goal!
- But Grace hasn't scored yet.

00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:35.939
Riley controls it.

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.981
We threaded the needle!

00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:42.981
Come on, Riley.

00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:11.982
Like that!  Did you see
that?  That's my daughter!

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:15.024
The foghorns win
the championship!

00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:22.983
He shoots, he scores!

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:25.983
Hello girls.
Congratulations on the win.

00:06:25.983 --> 00:06:29.941
- That's the coach from high school!
- What a match!

00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:33.983
The final attack there? The
three of you are very impressive.

00:06:33.983 --> 00:06:34.983
Thank you, Coach Roberts.

00:06:34.983 --> 00:06:39.983
I'm late, but whatever the
year I had a three day camp.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:43.983
I invite the area's best
players.  You have to come along.

00:06:43.983 --> 00:06:47.984
Are we dreaming right now?
Pin me right in the arm.

00:06:48.984 --> 00:06:49.984
I'm clearly awake.

00:06:49.984 --> 00:06:52.984
If we impress him, the three of
us will be on the team next year.

00:06:52.984 --> 00:06:56.984
Fire Eagle!  Finally a team
that I support wholeheartedly.

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.984
- What did you say?
- Yes!

00:07:00.943 --> 00:07:03.984
- We'll be there.
- Big.  Well then, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:07:04.026 --> 00:07:05.984
Too wild!

00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:12.985
A fun day!

00:07:12.985 --> 00:07:16.943
After all, you are a star.  You
get a trainer to slide backwards.

00:07:16.943 --> 00:07:21.985
- You got an ice hockey scholarship!
- Dad, stop.  It's just training camp.

00:07:21.985 --> 00:07:23.985
Who knows what happened?

00:07:26.985 --> 00:07:29.985
28, Anderson.  Leg span.

00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:32.944
My expulsion had almost
cost us our victory.

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:35.986
- What if I peek at the camp?
- Do not say that.

00:07:35.986 --> 00:07:39.986
- You did well today.
- Appropriate.  Mom understands.

00:07:40.986 --> 00:07:43.986
- Looks like I did.
- We are very proud of you.

00:07:43.986 --> 00:07:45.986
Good night, monkey.

00:07:45.986 --> 00:07:48.986
Yes yes.  Sleep well, darling.

00:07:54.986 --> 00:07:59.987
- Riley is very hard on herself.
- But we can make things easier.

00:08:00.987 --> 00:08:04.987
I present my super high
technology Riley protection system.

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:07.987
You don't see it.

00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:13.987
Here's to all the memories he has in
the back of his head like a penalty box.

00:08:13.987 --> 00:08:16.987
It was a burden on him,
so we lightened the burden.

00:08:16.987 --> 00:08:21.946
One-way express route to... “We don't
want to think about that right now.”

00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:26.946
- Not bad!
- Amazing.

00:08:26.946 --> 00:08:30.988
- You take good care of Riley.
- Thank You.  I do my best.

00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:32.988
Now we look for the memories.

00:08:32.988 --> 00:08:36.988
Here he is waving at a guy who is
actually waving at the girl in the back.

00:08:37.988 --> 00:08:39.988
Its bad.  Good choice.

00:08:39.988 --> 00:08:42.947
- Here she forgot her maiden name.
- Pretty awkward.

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:44.989
- So what's his name?
- Janet maybe?

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.989
It doesn't matter.  Go with him.

00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:50.989
We keep the best and
discard the worst.

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:55.989
Good work.  Anger, the rest
smokes in Long Term Memory.

00:09:02.989 --> 00:09:06.989
Okay.  Let's eat sleep.
Tomorrow's the big day.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.990
Joy, take it down there,
I think, you do too?

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.990
- Do you want to come this time?
- Yes.  I mean no.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.990
Oh no.  This may
not be very good.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.990
Everyone has experienced
this in their value system.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.990
But this is new.  And I
know how important it is.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.991
I don't want to damage anything
or burn it to the ground.

00:09:35.991 --> 00:09:39.991
You won't destroy anything.
Have I ever misled you?

00:09:39.991 --> 00:09:42.991
- Yes.  Often.
- Come on.

00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:46.991
Where I go go, you go.

00:10:11.992 --> 00:10:13.992
Geez.

00:10:45.994 --> 00:10:49.994
- Mom and dad are proud of me.
- One of the good old ones.

00:10:51.994 --> 00:10:55.952
- I'm kind.
- That's good.

00:10:57.994 --> 00:11:01.994
I am strong.  I am brave.
I am a very good friend.

00:11:17.995 --> 00:11:19.995
I'm a winner.

00:11:19.995 --> 00:11:24.995
Together, everyone created
this cherish our Riley.

00:11:24.995 --> 00:11:26.954
I am a good person.

00:11:51.996 --> 00:11:53.996
What the hell is that?

00:12:07.997 --> 00:12:09.997
PUBERTY

00:12:14.997 --> 00:12:18.956
- Turn it off, Joy!
- The earth is sinking!

00:12:18.997 --> 00:12:21.039
NO!  What are you doing now?

00:12:34.956 --> 00:12:36.998
- Problem solved.
- Joy...

00:12:41.998 --> 00:12:45.999
OK, we'll clean the
dent. It's demolition day!

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:52.957
- Demolition?  What is going on?
- What is going on?

00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:56.999
Who are you?

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:02.999
Do you support this?

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:03.999
SORRY FOR THE FUCK
PUBERTIS IS SOMETHING CRAZY

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:05.999
Are you good for not
tearing Headquarters down?

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:11.000
- There isn't anything.  The permit has just been completed.
- What for?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
For expansion, there
is room for others.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
- What about the other?
- Are they there yet?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
- Margie, do you have the console?
- Yes yes, wait a minute.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
- What are you doing now?
- Then he's ready.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.042
Now you have to wake up,
Riley.  You're going camping.

00:13:28.042 --> 00:13:33.001
- Lunch break!
- Wait!  You can't escape the chaos.

00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:37.001
- We will back.
- Come on.  We're going to be late.

00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:42.001
Riley, aren't you packing yet?

00:13:44.043 --> 00:13:49.001
You always chase me!  So
leave me alone for one second!

00:13:49.001 --> 00:13:52.001
- Are we overreacting a little?
- I barely touched it.

00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:56.001
- Flat pan destroys the console.
- What is wrong?

00:13:56.001 --> 00:14:00.002
- Mom looks sad.
- I'm the worst person in the world!

00:14:00.002 --> 00:14:03.043
- No, then.  Darling.
- I barely touched it.

00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:05.002
What did I say?

00:14:09.002 --> 00:14:11.002
Let a professional come to you.

00:14:13.002 --> 00:14:18.002
I'm too stupid to go
camping or go outside anymore!

00:14:18.002 --> 00:14:19.044
Yes, it's clearly broken.

00:14:21.003 --> 00:14:25.003
- We prepared for today.
- We agreed to take it easy.

00:14:25.003 --> 00:14:28.003
- But he smells.
- Very large!

00:14:28.003 --> 00:14:31.003
Stay calm.  Wait with
the agreed script.

00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:35.045
You're not stupid,
darling. You just change.

00:14:36.003 --> 00:14:39.003
Do you remember that beautiful
one? butterflies in the garden?

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:43.003
- It used to be a caterpillar.
- Alert.

00:14:43.003 --> 00:14:45.004
- Alert.
-... by getting wings.

00:14:45.004 --> 00:14:48.004
- If you have any questions...
- Mom!  Just go!

00:14:49.962 --> 00:14:53.004
A small preview of
the next ten years.

00:14:53.712 --> 00:14:55.712
- Riley!
- This will be so fun!

00:14:56.712 --> 00:14:59.712
Who's ready for ice hockey camp?

00:14:59.712 --> 00:15:03.713
Until we fix the problem, no one
is allowed to touch the console.

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.754
So what should we
do this weekend?

00:15:07.754 --> 00:15:11.713
We can finally get it
to clean the garage or...

00:15:11.713 --> 00:15:17.713
How cool will next year be?
Roberts' team just won every year.

00:15:17.713 --> 00:15:20.713
And Val Ortiz is
their leader now.

00:15:20.713 --> 00:15:23.755
Valentina Ortiz's
obsession is out of control.

00:15:24.714 --> 00:15:28.714
- He joined the team as a freshman.
- This is very difficult.

00:15:28.714 --> 00:15:35.714
We just have to play really well in
camp, then we'll all be Flamehawks!

00:15:35.714 --> 00:15:38.714
What's that?  We have one
glance.  I do not like it.

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:42.714
- You're paranoid.
- I never miss a glance.

00:15:44.756 --> 00:15:48.715
Zoom in 15 to 33. Slightly
to the right.  Zoom in.

00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:50.715
There!

00:15:50.715 --> 00:15:54.715
- And?
- He's hiding something.  But what?

00:15:56.715 --> 00:15:59.715
- What is he doing?
- He looked into our eyes!

00:15:59.715 --> 00:16:02.715
No, not just that.

00:16:04.715 --> 00:16:07.715
- I can't see anything new.
- Compare.

00:16:07.715 --> 00:16:11.715
Look at yourself.
Riley before, Riley now.

00:16:11.715 --> 00:16:14.716
- It is clear!
- But what does that mean?

00:16:14.757 --> 00:16:16.757
He knows we're hiding something.

00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:20.716
- What happened?
- I do not know!

00:16:21.716 --> 00:16:24.716
- I can not take it anymore!
- You spit!

00:16:25.716 --> 00:16:28.675
Roberts will not remain
our coach next year.

00:16:30.758 --> 00:16:33.716
We have found one
second high school.

00:16:35.716 --> 00:16:36.717
Oh no.

00:16:37.717 --> 00:16:41.717
Okay.  Good.

00:16:41.717 --> 00:16:45.717
- This is not very good!
- Seriously?  How long have they known?

00:16:45.717 --> 00:16:48.759
We can't move on to high
school without Bree and Grace.

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:50.717
We can still go for a walk.

00:16:50.717 --> 00:16:54.717
And we have the weekend, so we're coming along
for the last time we can play as a team together.

00:16:55.717 --> 00:16:57.717
Friends forever, right?

00:16:57.717 --> 00:16:59.717
Yes.  Of course.

00:17:01.676 --> 00:17:06.718
- I can't wait to get on the ice.
- When will we get the program?

00:17:06.718 --> 00:17:07.759
This is very sad.

00:17:08.718 --> 00:17:11.718
- Do not be sad!
- No.

00:17:11.718 --> 00:17:13.718
Wait while driving.

00:17:14.718 --> 00:17:18.677
So here we are.  Here
it looks pretty cool.

00:17:18.718 --> 00:17:21.718
And you don't lack a single
assistant coach?  I have time.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.719
NO?  See you later,
in a few days.

00:17:24.719 --> 00:17:28.719
- You shouldn't miss us too much.
- Riley, do you have everything now?

00:17:28.719 --> 00:17:30.719
- Staff?  Gloves?
- Yes.

00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:34.719
- Is your phone charged?
- Yes, it's 50%.  That's fine.

00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:37.761
Call if anything
comes up.  I love you.

00:17:37.761 --> 00:17:40.719
- Okay.  I love you.
- Don't forget deodorant.

00:17:40.719 --> 00:17:42.761
- Mother!
- Hey, hey, monkey.

00:17:44.719 --> 00:17:47.719
Okay, now.

00:17:52.678 --> 00:17:54.761
It doesn't matter.  We need it.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.720
That's a high school student!  We will
not stand there with red and swollen eyes.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.720
Don't worry, we have plenty of
time to think about it after camp.

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:11.762
Where did Bree and Grace go?

00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:15.721
- They're there.
- Aren't those traitors already dead to us?

00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:17.721
Our best friend?  NO.

00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:23.721
Are you okay?

00:18:23.721 --> 00:18:25.721
Behave normally! This
is Valentina Ortiz.

00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:26.721
We have to say something.

00:18:28.763 --> 00:18:30.721
- Hello.
- Hello.  My name is Val.

00:18:30.763 --> 00:18:34.721
Yes, you were the captain and broke records
as a junior.  Your favorite color is red...

00:18:35.721 --> 00:18:37.722
- What do we say?
- We're not cool.

00:18:37.722 --> 00:18:41.722
- Why are we holding his hand?
- Like me.

00:18:41.722 --> 00:18:45.722
Coach has told us about it
you. Riley's from Michigan, right?

00:18:45.722 --> 00:18:49.722
- Minnesota, sweet.
- We can't fix Val Ortiz.

00:18:50.722 --> 00:18:54.722
Yes, it's me.  Riley
goes good old Michigan.

00:18:55.722 --> 00:18:58.722
- Who makes orange consoles?
- I haven't touched it.

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.764
- Orange is not my color.
- Not me.

00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:02.764
Hi everybody.

00:19:03.723 --> 00:19:09.723
I'm your big fan.  And
now I stand opposite you.

00:19:09.723 --> 00:19:11.723
How can I help?

00:19:11.723 --> 00:19:15.723
I can take notes, drink coffee,
manage your calendar, watch you sleep.

00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:20.723
You may have wild energy! Maybe
you could just stay in one place.

00:19:20.723 --> 00:19:22.765
Whatever.  I AM
always here for you.

00:19:23.723 --> 00:19:27.724
- Love it.  What's your name?
- Oops, I forgot that.

00:19:27.724 --> 00:19:29.724
I'm Anxious.  One of
Riley's new Feelings.

00:19:29.724 --> 00:19:33.766
We're proud to be Here.
Where do I put my things?

00:19:33.766 --> 00:19:38.724
- What do you mean by "we"?
- Only I am as tall as you.

00:19:38.724 --> 00:19:41.724
- Who are you?
- I envy.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:45.724
- Wow!  Good hair.
- Forget it.

00:19:46.724 --> 00:19:49.725
Look at his hair!  we
should have hair like that.

00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:53.766
I like the red
color in your hair.

00:19:53.766 --> 00:19:55.725
What are you doing now?

00:19:55.725 --> 00:20:00.725
When I join the team, may I
also color it completely red.

00:20:03.725 --> 00:20:07.725
- What kind of man is that?
- What is your name, big bun?

00:20:07.725 --> 00:20:11.767
That's Flove.  He doesn't like
eye contact and doesn't talk much.

00:20:12.726 --> 00:20:13.726
But he is very funny.

00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:16.726
Welcome to Headquarters, Flove.

00:20:16.726 --> 00:20:18.726
Yes, we are making... No.

00:20:18.726 --> 00:20:20.726
Not high.

00:20:20.726 --> 00:20:22.726
Your palms are quite sweaty.

00:20:23.768 --> 00:20:26.768
Should we be followed?  Then
you can meet some Flamehawks.

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:30.726
Very interesting!  But
we shouldn't show him that.

00:20:31.726 --> 00:20:32.726
Yes, quite good.

00:20:32.726 --> 00:20:35.726
- What is that feeling?
- That's Ennui.

00:20:35.726 --> 00:20:36.727
Wh-what?

00:20:37.727 --> 00:20:40.768
Ennui.  That's all, you
will be called boredom.

00:20:41.727 --> 00:20:43.768
Come here, An-way!

00:20:43.768 --> 00:20:45.727
Did I say that right?

00:20:45.727 --> 00:20:48.727
An-waa?  NO.  Nickname!
I just call you Oui-Oui.

00:20:48.727 --> 00:20:49.727
NO.

00:20:50.727 --> 00:20:53.727
- How do you control it?
- By application.

00:20:53.727 --> 00:20:55.727
Stop it!  Now that's enough.

00:20:55.727 --> 00:21:00.728
The new feeling can at
first seem very rarely used

00:21:00.728 --> 00:21:04.728
- and you just want to say to
them: "Why are you so annoying?"

00:21:05.728 --> 00:21:09.728
But I've learned that everyone's
emotions are good for Riley.

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:13.770
- Even this lump.
- OK, good enough.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.728
- Cold.  Previously.
- Take your things and follow me.

00:21:18.728 --> 00:21:21.728
- What about our friends?
- Elections are our future.

00:21:21.728 --> 00:21:26.729
So agreed.  We should make new friends,
so we won't be alone in high school.

00:21:26.729 --> 00:21:28.729
- Not really, Joy?
- Possible...

00:21:29.729 --> 00:21:32.729
Wait.  Thank you for
showing me around.

00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:34.771
- Why did you do that?
- Excuse me.  What am I doing?

00:21:34.771 --> 00:21:39.729
- We left our best friend.
- But we have to go out and meet new people.

00:21:39.729 --> 00:21:42.729
The next three days should
be about Bree and Grace.

00:21:42.729 --> 00:21:47.771
The next three days can decide
the next four years of our lives.

00:21:47.771 --> 00:21:49.771
That's too much.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.730
- Joy is really old fashioned.
- What?

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.730
You make Riley happy.
Sad makes him sad.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.730
Fear protects against that
scary thing, he can see-

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:05.730
- and I protect from scary
things, he can't see.  I think ahead.

00:22:05.772 --> 00:22:07.730
Now you just have to see it.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:11.730
I use it as a cup holder.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:16.731
My team has processed all the data.
We estimate the following scenario:

00:22:16.731 --> 00:22:19.731
If we're just messing
around with Bree and Grace-

00:22:19.731 --> 00:22:22.731
- not that Riley is
cool in Val's eyes.

00:22:22.731 --> 00:22:26.731
He didn't impress the coaches, wouldn't survive
the Flamehawks and then come to high school-

00:22:26.773 --> 00:22:31.731
- where he was alone, eating alone,
and only the teacher knew his name.

00:22:31.731 --> 00:22:35.731
- The two of us will become good friends.
- This is a sad story.

00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:40.732
This is an amazing story.  Love
your energy, but you're way out.

00:22:40.732 --> 00:22:44.732
- None of this will happen.
- If you say so.

00:22:44.732 --> 00:22:48.732
Do you remember when we all
finally made it to Headquarters?

00:22:48.732 --> 00:22:53.774
– It's been 30 seconds, Nostalgia.
- Yes, that was the time.

00:22:53.774 --> 00:22:55.774
Nostalgia, you must not
have reached here yet.

00:22:56.732 --> 00:23:02.733
You have ten years to come, two graduations
and a wedding.  I have to speak up.

00:23:02.733 --> 00:23:06.733
Focus!  Val leads us
into the sacred halls.

00:23:06.733 --> 00:23:08.733
Here he is!

00:23:10.775 --> 00:23:13.775
The girls are so cool!

00:23:13.775 --> 00:23:16.733
And older.  We dress not
about being in front of them.

00:23:16.733 --> 00:23:19.733
In the dressing room
there is mutual respect.

00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:22.733
- You should meet the other Flamehawks.
- Keep going?

00:23:23.733 --> 00:23:25.734
- Hello.
- Riley is from Michigan.

00:23:25.734 --> 00:23:29.775
- OK, we'll keep it that way.
- Where are you from in Michigan?

00:23:30.775 --> 00:23:33.734
- What now?
- Then we have to ride it until it runs out.

00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:36.734
- Michigan cities...
- We have to think of something.

00:23:36.734 --> 00:23:40.734
- A little here and there.
- Good.  See you on the ice.

00:23:40.734 --> 00:23:43.776
- Do you want to sit with us?
- He wants to sit with us!

00:23:44.734 --> 00:23:45.776
Everything is beautiful!

00:23:45.776 --> 00:23:49.735
What about Bree and
Blessing?  We sat there.

00:23:49.776 --> 00:23:53.735
I will make room for that
my friends.  Thank You.

00:23:54.735 --> 00:23:58.735
- Yes alright.  Okay.
- It wasn't that difficult then.

00:23:58.735 --> 00:24:02.735
No, that decision will be taken later,
don't bother us for the rest of our lives.

00:24:02.735 --> 00:24:04.777
- It is a lie!
- Bree and Grace!

00:24:04.777 --> 00:24:06.735
There he is!

00:24:06.735 --> 00:24:09.735
Then it's time to cheer!

00:24:09.735 --> 00:24:10.735
Say...

00:24:11.735 --> 00:24:13.736
Well done, ladies.  Fall.

00:24:17.777 --> 00:24:18.777
Joy?

00:24:19.736 --> 00:24:20.778
- Wait! Wait!
- Miss!

00:24:20.778 --> 00:24:24.736
“Fall” means “fall to
rest." You have to listen.

00:24:24.736 --> 00:24:27.736
So now I need your
cell phone.  All of them.

00:24:30.736 --> 00:24:35.778
You are here to work, not to play
around.  Are you there, Andersen?

00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:38.737
Yes, coach.

00:24:38.737 --> 00:24:42.737
Put your phone in the box.
You'll get it again after camp.

00:24:44.737 --> 00:24:47.737
His coach took it
quite seriously.

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:51.779
- Maybe I can help...?
- No, thank you.  Not now.

00:24:51.779 --> 00:24:52.779
Yes, right?

00:24:55.737 --> 00:24:57.737
Do you think this is funny?

00:24:57.737 --> 00:25:01.738
You know what's also fun? Penalty
round.  Get on the ice, ladies!

00:25:01.738 --> 00:25:04.738
- Well done, Michigan.
- Thank you very much, new girl.

00:25:06.738 --> 00:25:10.780
- Good job, Joy.  Now he fits clearly.
- Thank you, Oui-Oui.

00:25:14.738 --> 00:25:19.738
- You are behind, Andersen!  Faster!
- This is the most disappointing.

00:25:19.738 --> 00:25:24.780
Well done, ladies.  That's small
breathing room.  And then we formed a team.

00:25:30.739 --> 00:25:34.739
- His Michigan girls got off to a bad start.
- Are they talking about us?

00:25:34.739 --> 00:25:38.739
He won't make the team, if
he doesn't control himself.

00:25:38.739 --> 00:25:41.781
As if you were in control of
everything in the first year?

00:25:41.781 --> 00:25:47.739
- I'm not very mature.
- You put a straw in your nose.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.740
Now I have to do it, big bun.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.740
I always dream of those people talking
about us.  But it's not like that.

00:25:59.782 --> 00:26:01.740
Joy, what do we do now?

00:26:02.782 --> 00:26:06.740
- We can just...
- I have an idea.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.740
If we complete our side's
Val, everything will go well.

00:26:14.782 --> 00:26:17.741
- Election?
- Hey, Riley.  What is it?

00:26:20.741 --> 00:26:23.741
Excuse me.  I will not give
penalty rounds to the whole team.

00:26:23.741 --> 00:26:27.741
I feel bad.  I appreciate you
and will never ruin it for you.

00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:32.741
- You apply it a little thickly.
- You are just an excellent captain...

00:26:32.783 --> 00:26:35.741
- I really admire you.
- OK, OK.  Thank You.

00:26:35.741 --> 00:26:41.742
Coach was tough on you today, but
that just means you're on his radar.

00:26:41.742 --> 00:26:44.742
- Do?
- Good, you come and talk to me.

00:26:44.742 --> 00:26:47.784
- We should try to get into the same team.
- Cold.

00:26:47.784 --> 00:26:50.784
Wow.  Only I can do that.

00:26:50.784 --> 00:26:54.742
Nothing special. I
just want to help.

00:26:54.742 --> 00:26:58.742
Agree.  So that's great, Angst.

00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:03.784
I step back, you step in and get Riley
on the right track.  Now I'm active again.

00:27:03.784 --> 00:27:06.784
- That's just the first part of the plan.
- Is there a second part?

00:27:06.784 --> 00:27:08.785
A good plan has several parts.

00:27:09.743 --> 00:27:11.785
Now we form teams
for the rest of camp.

00:27:12.743 --> 00:27:16.743
Split yourself down the middle.  Team
one to the right, hold two to the left.

00:27:16.743 --> 00:27:20.785
- Now we do it!
- Again in the same team.

00:27:22.743 --> 00:27:25.744
- Val wants us!
- But we made a promise to Bree and Grace.

00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:27.785
We have to think ahead.

00:27:29.744 --> 00:27:34.744
Come on, Riley, move your feet. Val
is on team one, step aside.  Come on.

00:27:34.744 --> 00:27:37.786
He gave his friends a
lift.  He wouldn't break it.

00:27:37.786 --> 00:27:39.744
You're right, Joy.

00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:42.744
What are you doing now?

00:27:43.744 --> 00:27:46.744
NO!  You shouldn't
take that.  Put it again.

00:27:48.745 --> 00:27:52.745
Not to hold it against
me, but it has to go.

00:28:01.745 --> 00:28:05.745
- NO.
- Change is scary, but look here.

00:28:07.745 --> 00:28:09.745
I look forward to it.

00:28:10.787 --> 00:28:13.746
Welcome to the team, Michigan.

00:28:19.746 --> 00:28:22.746
- That's not Riley.
- This is a better Riley.

00:28:22.746 --> 00:28:25.746
Riley won't be alone next year.

00:28:25.746 --> 00:28:29.788
We build a new self-concept
on him.  The new Riley.

00:28:29.788 --> 00:28:31.788
NO!  You shouldn't take
it down there with him.

00:28:32.746 --> 00:28:34.746
It will be mine
dead, a burnt corpse!

00:28:35.788 --> 00:28:39.747
I am so sorry.  I am looking
forward to this collaboration.

00:28:39.747 --> 00:28:44.789
- What are you doing now?
- Riley's life is more complicated now.

00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:49.747
This requires more sophisticated
emotions. He no longer needs you, Joy.

00:28:50.747 --> 00:28:54.747
- How dare you?!
- You can't just lock us up like that.

00:28:54.747 --> 00:28:55.747
Great idea!

00:28:57.747 --> 00:28:58.747
I can't breathe!

00:28:59.747 --> 00:29:03.789
It's not forever.  Only until
Riley would be 18, or maybe forever.

00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:07.748
- We will see.  See you!
- Afraid!  Riley needs us!

00:29:08.748 --> 00:29:11.748
Don't worry, Riley.
You are in good hands.

00:29:11.748 --> 00:29:14.748
Now we change
everything about you.

00:29:23.748 --> 00:29:28.749
Quick question.  How to build
us a new Riley, cool concept-

00:29:28.749 --> 00:29:31.749
- if it took 13 years
to build the old one?

00:29:32.749 --> 00:29:35.749
The good news is that we
are not starting from scratch.

00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:38.749
- I want to plant it too!
- Next time.

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:48.749
If I'm a Flamehawk,
I'm not alone.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:57.792
No, no, no.

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.750
- So set us free!
- Stop!  Shut us up!

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.750
Oh, joy...

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:08.792
BOX

00:30:11.792 --> 00:30:16.751
We'll be like that here forever!

00:30:20.751 --> 00:30:23.793
- Where are you taking us?
- Know Riley's secret.

00:30:23.793 --> 00:30:26.751
- We're not a secret.
- Yes yes.

00:30:26.793 --> 00:30:30.751
- "This is a big misunderstanding."
- We've never heard of it before.

00:30:33.751 --> 00:30:36.751
We are suppressed emotions!

00:30:36.751 --> 00:30:41.793
- Shut us up!  Now!
- No, Riley will probably handle it.  Overall.

00:30:41.793 --> 00:30:47.752
Hello.  Do you know what we call
that? Denial.  Can you say "denial"?

00:30:47.794 --> 00:30:48.794
Hello friends.

00:30:49.752 --> 00:30:53.752
WELCOME.  How wonderful it is
to have you here with us today.

00:30:53.752 --> 00:30:57.794
- It's Blubber!
- Of that show Riley watched when he was four?

00:30:57.794 --> 00:31:00.794
Appropriate.  And
here's a little secret.

00:31:02.753 --> 00:31:04.753
Riley can still be
like the program.

00:31:05.753 --> 00:31:07.753
step like an
elephant, travel like a

00:31:07.753 --> 00:31:09.753
mouse, let's quickly
get to Blubber's house

00:31:10.753 --> 00:31:11.753
Kill me.

00:31:11.753 --> 00:31:15.795
The bubble that covered US.
Can you help us get out of here?

00:31:16.795 --> 00:31:20.753
We will need your
help. Can you free them?

00:31:21.753 --> 00:31:23.753
- Who are you talking to?
- My friends.

00:31:23.753 --> 00:31:25.754
Can you see the key?

00:31:28.754 --> 00:31:30.795
I can't do that either.

00:31:30.795 --> 00:31:32.795
- We're done.
- That far.

00:31:32.795 --> 00:31:35.796
Welcome to your eternal destiny.

00:31:35.796 --> 00:31:40.754
- Spear Sword?
- After all, he plays computer games.

00:31:40.754 --> 00:31:43.754
- What is she doing here?
- Riley is secretly in love with him.

00:31:43.754 --> 00:31:45.754
If I understand the reason.

00:31:45.754 --> 00:31:50.796
I long to be a hero, but
darkness haunts my past.

00:31:50.796 --> 00:31:52.796
I understand.

00:31:55.755 --> 00:31:59.755
- Who's this?
- It's Riley's Dark Secret.

00:31:59.755 --> 00:32:01.755
What's the secret?

00:32:02.755 --> 00:32:03.797
You don't want to know that.

00:32:03.797 --> 00:32:07.755
An anarchic feeling has
taken over Headquarters.

00:32:07.797 --> 00:32:11.755
- If you just opened the jar...
- Children, now we have to learn Latin.

00:32:11.755 --> 00:32:16.756
Know Iquid pro quo?  We'll get you
a jar, if you get us out of the box.

00:32:16.756 --> 00:32:20.797
No, Blubber.  We are
not masters of their fate.

00:32:20.797 --> 00:32:25.756
We were all thrown into this place and remain
thrown away because we don't belong, we're useless.

00:32:25.756 --> 00:32:29.756
You don't have to say that!  You
don't deserve to be kicked out.

00:32:29.756 --> 00:32:32.756
Wait a minute, Lance.  Remember
the so-called power moves.

00:32:32.756 --> 00:32:36.756
- Now I'm going to chase you, Riley!
- Well, so you think so?  Look here!

00:32:38.798 --> 00:32:39.757
Frankly!

00:32:39.798 --> 00:32:43.757
Listen to me, Lance Slashblade.
No one is completely useless.

00:32:43.757 --> 00:32:46.757
But I am a warrior cursed
with a pheasant attack.

00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:49.757
Then make your own
curse on your gift.

00:32:51.757 --> 00:32:55.799
Protect yourselves, friends,
for I will set you all free!

00:33:00.757 --> 00:33:01.758
Can we get help?

00:33:04.758 --> 00:33:09.758
Well done, Dark Secret. Now
it's your turn to help us.

00:33:09.758 --> 00:33:15.800
My belt bag contains what we can
get out Say after me: "Oh, Bagesen!"

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.800
"Oh, the Wallet!"

00:33:21.758 --> 00:33:25.759
- Hi everybody.  I'm Taskesen.
- The bag, we want to escape.

00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:28.800
- Do you have anything that can help us?
- I have a lot.

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:34.759
What do you think you can do that
is best used?  A tomato?  A frog?

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:37.759
- Or a stick of dynamite?
- You gods!

00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:44.801
Hooray!  We did it!  Now sing
us all the song "We did it".

00:33:45.801 --> 00:33:48.801
- Continue!
- Thank you friends.  I might...

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.760
I have to leave you.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.760
What About Dark Secrets?

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.760
Not yet.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.802
That's probably
best for everyone.

00:34:00.802 --> 00:34:04.760
- Who let you out?  With you!
- What are we doing?

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:10.760
Oh, you're disgusting.  As you thought
of me, now I will believe in myself.

00:34:15.761 --> 00:34:17.802
What?

00:34:26.761 --> 00:34:27.761
What happened?

00:34:33.803 --> 00:34:35.803
- Dave, help!
- Wait a moment!

00:34:36.761 --> 00:34:37.762
Dave!

00:34:37.803 --> 00:34:38.803
MY HAT

00:34:39.762 --> 00:34:40.762
Spear!

00:34:40.762 --> 00:34:43.762
Goodbye friends.
Good afternoon, fate!

00:34:43.803 --> 00:34:46.762
There is one more lid for
each jar.  Already come!

00:34:48.554 --> 00:34:51.595
- What are we doing?
- Angry, stop it!  Where are you going?

00:34:52.595 --> 00:34:54.596
To Headquarters...
to help Riley!

00:34:54.596 --> 00:34:57.596
Riley wasn't up
there. He's out there.

00:34:57.596 --> 00:35:00.554
We can't go back
without his concept.

00:35:00.554 --> 00:35:06.554
How about we go to the
Back Head? Are you crazy?

00:35:06.554 --> 00:35:07.596
Enjoy how...

00:35:07.596 --> 00:35:09.596
Stop!  Nobody moves!

00:35:11.596 --> 00:35:14.555
Do you have a plan?

00:35:14.596 --> 00:35:19.555
- Angst probably has a really good plan.
- Of course I have a plan.

00:35:19.555 --> 00:35:23.555
He wasn't the only one there
thinking ahead.  First we just need…

00:35:25.597 --> 00:35:26.597
Give me a moment.

00:35:26.597 --> 00:35:29.555
We follow the Stream
of Consciousness.

00:35:29.555 --> 00:35:34.556
- Then we sail all the way to Baghovedet.
- Where are the bad memories.

00:35:34.556 --> 00:35:36.556
There we find that
Riley, we know and love.

00:35:37.556 --> 00:35:41.598
We put in space Self-Concept,
and Riley will be Riley again.

00:35:41.598 --> 00:35:44.598
– That plan could really work.
- Yes!

00:35:44.598 --> 00:35:48.598
And then I said to Angst:
“You shouldn't worry too much."

00:35:49.556 --> 00:35:52.556
And he would say, “I never
thought about it.  Thank You!"

00:35:52.556 --> 00:35:56.556
- Then we hugged and became friends.
- And I'll take it down.

00:35:56.556 --> 00:36:00.557
- Not angry.
- Good.  I didn't pry.

00:36:01.598 --> 00:36:05.599
Don't worry, I know how to power.
Triste and I have been here before.

00:36:06.557 --> 00:36:10.557
- Joy, this is a dead end.
- It's just the worst alley!

00:36:10.557 --> 00:36:14.599
Everything changed so fast.

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:18.557
- We're lost.
- If it's fun, you're not lost.

00:36:18.557 --> 00:36:22.599
- Nobody thought it was funny.
- Nonsense.  Look how much fun Triste is having.

00:36:24.558 --> 00:36:27.558
- I think you know the way.
- I am willing.  Moment.

00:36:27.558 --> 00:36:30.600
- He doesn't know the way.
- We're trapped here!

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600
Riley was awake.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:37.600
It's still too early.  What did they do
him with?  Come on, we'll find another way.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.558
Don't worry, Riley.
We'll be there.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.600
- Why do we get up so early?
- Because we have to speed up a little, mon ami.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.559
So we're going to get on the ice early and
practice like we've never practiced before.

00:36:56.601 --> 00:36:59.559
- Aren't we fine?  - Yes.

00:36:59.559 --> 00:37:02.559
- But the Flamehawk is really good.
- Appropriate.

00:37:05.601 --> 00:37:10.560
Every time we miss, we take it
around.  Ice hockey is not a game.

00:37:21.602 --> 00:37:24.602
- Like!
- It was amazing.

00:37:24.602 --> 00:37:27.602
We have to be that good
all the time.  Again.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.560
- I'm not the only one who likes to be fresh in the morning.
- It's Val!  We got the same idea.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.561
We're almost the same.
We became good friends.

00:37:35.561 --> 00:37:38.602
- How long are you here?
- About an hour.

00:37:39.602 --> 00:37:42.603
- I want extra time on the ice.
- Me too.

00:37:42.603 --> 00:37:44.561
He understands us!

00:37:44.603 --> 00:37:49.561
I've told the others that you have to take
control of everything.  You know what it takes.

00:37:51.561 --> 00:37:54.603
Check us out.
This went smoothly.

00:37:54.603 --> 00:37:58.603
- Yes.  But Val sure likes us a lot.
- Ask Val lots of questions.

00:37:59.562 --> 00:38:03.603
- People like to talk about themselves.
- How was your first year as a Flamehawk?

00:38:04.562 --> 00:38:08.562
So it's a tough job.
As in very difficult.

00:38:08.562 --> 00:38:12.604
- But I met my best friend.
- Val shares something with us!

00:38:12.604 --> 00:38:17.562
We were on a night out and
ordered takeout.  Come with me.

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:20.562
Invitation exclusive.
We will go with you!

00:38:20.562 --> 00:38:23.563
- According to you?
- Of course.  Will be fun.

00:38:23.563 --> 00:38:25.563
Well done, ladies.
Then we warm up.

00:38:26.563 --> 00:38:28.604
- Hey, Riley.
- Hello.

00:38:29.605 --> 00:38:34.563
- We don't share Val with them.
- Morning makes me very hungry.

00:38:34.605 --> 00:38:37.605
- I'd die for a slice of pizza now.
- Yes!

00:38:38.563 --> 00:38:41.563
I said I know the way.
Stream of consciousness.

00:38:41.563 --> 00:38:44.605
- But...
- Wow, he's hungry!

00:38:44.605 --> 00:38:47.605
- Eat something delicious!
- Deep Pizza!

00:38:47.605 --> 00:38:50.564
- And it's still warm.
- With added cheese!

00:38:50.605 --> 00:38:55.564
- Sad, come on.
- Listen.  We couldn't take the tube home.

00:38:55.564 --> 00:39:00.564
- Only if they activate us with the console.
- We're stranded here.

00:39:00.564 --> 00:39:04.606
- Anxiety must be thinking about that.
- I doubt that.  Good.  Okay.

00:39:04.606 --> 00:39:09.565
Someone has to climb that
pipe, go home to Headquarters -

00:39:09.565 --> 00:39:11.565
- and take us back.

00:39:11.565 --> 00:39:13.565
- I did that.  I destroyed it...
- Zero.

00:39:14.565 --> 00:39:15.565
- Listen.
- Not you at all.

00:39:15.565 --> 00:39:19.607
- Thank You.
- Should I put a hose in it?

00:39:19.607 --> 00:39:20.607
Forget it.

00:39:23.565 --> 00:39:27.607
- Oh no.  Not me.
- Yes, Sad!  You can.

00:39:28.565 --> 00:39:32.565
You're an expert on consoles.
You know the manual by heart.

00:39:32.565 --> 00:39:37.607
You say so, but I know a lot
less about manual 28, chapter 7-

00:39:37.607 --> 00:39:40.607
- "Remembering objects without
for memory" than people think.

00:39:41.566 --> 00:39:43.608
There you prove my
point.  Sounds like yes.

00:39:43.608 --> 00:39:49.566
- Where are you?  Are you taking a break now?
- Walkie talkie!  Here.  Can you hear me?

00:39:49.566 --> 00:39:53.608
Green light from Glæde.  Shift.
We'll signal when we get there.

00:39:53.608 --> 00:39:57.608
And then you got us back.  He's
the quickest way to Headquarters.

00:39:57.608 --> 00:40:01.567
I can't.  I'm not
strong like you.

00:40:01.567 --> 00:40:04.567
I know you, Sad.  You're strong.

00:40:04.567 --> 00:40:08.609
I don't have a specific
one for example, but you can.

00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:15.567
- Don't look down.  Just crawl.
- Yes.  I can do that.

00:40:17.609 --> 00:40:21.568
- He can handle it.  No?
- 50% chance.

00:40:22.568 --> 00:40:23.568
Do you want one?

00:40:24.609 --> 00:40:27.609
We hate those bars. It
tastes like cardboard.

00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:31.610
- We can't say no to Val.
- You are absolutely right.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.568
- We eat what Val eats.
- That's how it should sound.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:38.568
Envy, you're in the zone.
Bear with me for a moment.

00:40:38.568 --> 00:40:43.610
- He chose me!  Did you see it, Ennui?
- You care too much about everything.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.610
The texture is interesting.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:53.569
It feels like... What
does that remind me of now?

00:40:54.569 --> 00:40:57.611
Cardboard box?
Asparagus?  Broccoli?

00:40:57.611 --> 00:41:01.611
- What did they do to him up there?
- Don't know.  But we have to go.

00:41:01.611 --> 00:41:04.611
- I didn't step...
- Yes.  Riley needs us.

00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:06.569
Okay!

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:12.570
Clumsy.  I thought
I was going to vomit.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.570
If I'm good at ice
hockey, I make friends.

00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:40.571
- Good, Miss Riley.
- That's right, Michigan.

00:41:40.571 --> 00:41:44.571
You have practiced well
today.  Now relax tonight.

00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:49.613
Now comes the best!  Partying
with Val and our future lovers!

00:41:50.613 --> 00:41:52.613
Why do we stop here?

00:41:52.613 --> 00:41:55.613
There it is.  Red Notebook.

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:59.572
- Now you scared him.
- Why does that scare me?

00:41:59.572 --> 00:42:04.613
All the coach's thoughts about you still
apply in that one.  The good and the bad.

00:42:04.613 --> 00:42:06.614
- Will you join the team.
- Or not.

00:42:07.614 --> 00:42:11.572
- That's too much.
- We only tell the truth.

00:42:11.572 --> 00:42:14.614
- What did he write about us?
- Do you think it's something bad?

00:42:14.614 --> 00:42:19.572
Not until now!  Imagine if we
weren't on the favorites list.

00:42:19.572 --> 00:42:22.614
Or we stand at the top
of the exercise list.

00:42:22.614 --> 00:42:26.614
Or worse: We don't stand on any
of the lists and are invisible!

00:42:26.614 --> 00:42:31.573
- Sorry, but they're leaving now.
- We lost them.

00:42:33.573 --> 00:42:37.615
A comfortable first night with
the group.  Be completely natural.

00:42:37.615 --> 00:42:41.615
- Why do we swing our arms like that?
- Keep your arms still.

00:42:41.615 --> 00:42:45.615
- It looks too crazy!
- Go as Dani.  The arms are rhythmic.

00:42:46.574 --> 00:42:51.574
- Now you are making things worse!
- Yes, sorry, actually I was trying something!

00:42:51.574 --> 00:42:55.616
- What do you think the pouch is for?
- Ennui, I'm proud of you.

00:42:57.616 --> 00:43:00.574
They laughed.  Does anyone know
what cool people are laughing at?

00:43:00.574 --> 00:43:03.574
We are busy with weapons.
Let's just say we get the joke.

00:43:10.575 --> 00:43:14.616
- Anger filled all the broccoli.
- Scared, what's wrong?

00:43:14.616 --> 00:43:18.617
- I'm not happy with this ship.
- When do we get there?

00:43:18.617 --> 00:43:22.575
- We were there when we were there.
- Anxiety will find out soon.

00:43:22.575 --> 00:43:24.575
He knows everything, right?

00:43:24.575 --> 00:43:26.575
I don't like his
words or actions.

00:43:27.617 --> 00:43:32.575
- But I think I can change it.
- Who likes banana cake?  Hands on!

00:43:35.617 --> 00:43:38.576
Well, Michigan, what
is your favorite band?

00:43:39.576 --> 00:43:42.576
Everyone looked at us.  There
is only one correct answer there.

00:43:44.618 --> 00:43:46.618
Rise and Shine!
They are too fat.

00:43:46.618 --> 00:43:50.576
I was just them completely
crazy in seventh grade.

00:43:50.618 --> 00:43:53.576
- Do you?
- I am a Glow Girly.

00:43:53.576 --> 00:43:56.576
NO!  That's definitely something
some of them think is cool.

00:43:57.577 --> 00:43:59.577
Remember everything
we know about music.

00:44:15.577 --> 00:44:17.619
We definitely know a cool song.

00:44:19.619 --> 00:44:21.619
- Fresh Tripelmint -
makes the smile white

00:44:22.619 --> 00:44:25.578
Flove, get rid of it!  There
must be something here, somewhere.

00:44:25.578 --> 00:44:29.578
Something better, something
Cool.  No, not that one.

00:44:29.578 --> 00:44:33.578
We don't have anything better!
There are dad's jingles and soft rock.

00:44:33.578 --> 00:44:36.620
You still can't be like
Rise and Shine, right?

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.578
Do not panic.
What are we doing?

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.620
If we don't like their
music, we are nothing to them.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:45.579
- We are considered as candidates.
- Excuse me.

00:44:45.579 --> 00:44:48.579
I've been waiting all
my life for this moment.

00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:52.620
Of course.  I love
Rise and Shine.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.621
Love Rise and Shine.

00:45:01.579 --> 00:45:02.621
Avoid broccoli!

00:45:11.621 --> 00:45:13.621
- Joy!
- Reach out your hand.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.580
- What's that?
- It's a Sarcasm Gap!

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:21.580
It can open several
kilometers!  Run for your life!

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.580
Sarcasm gap?  Seriously?

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.622
Rise and Shine is
my favorite band.

00:45:26.622 --> 00:45:29.622
He likes Bangun and Binar.  They
create their own choreography.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.581
Joy if we don't follow the moment,
we don't know where we end up.

00:45:33.581 --> 00:45:36.581
And if we don't know,
we can't go with the flow!

00:45:36.581 --> 00:45:40.581
This is a vicious circle of
tragedy and its consequences!

00:45:40.581 --> 00:45:43.623
- We can also ask them there.
- We can do it too.

00:45:43.623 --> 00:45:46.623
How lucky we are
that we found you!

00:45:46.623 --> 00:45:52.581
How lucky we are
that we met you.

00:45:53.581 --> 00:45:56.581
Come on!  We really
need your help!

00:45:56.581 --> 00:45:59.623
We really need your help.

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:03.623
- What's their problem?
- You just need to increase the charm.

00:46:03.623 --> 00:46:08.582
Hello!  You are guaranteed to be the
coolest crane operator in the whole world!

00:46:08.624 --> 00:46:10.624
They're just some thugs.

00:46:12.582 --> 00:46:14.624
They're just some thugs.

00:46:14.624 --> 00:46:18.624
Rise and Shine is very cool.

00:46:18.624 --> 00:46:22.624
What are you talking about?
You do love Rise and Shine.

00:46:22.624 --> 00:46:24.583
Hello there.

00:46:24.583 --> 00:46:27.583
Why do we do best friends
hang out all the time?

00:46:27.583 --> 00:46:30.583
We were just at a
concert with them.

00:46:30.583 --> 00:46:33.625
- Yes, yes, but...
- But what?

00:46:33.625 --> 00:46:36.583
- That was really fun.
- Grace, you're not helping.

00:46:36.625 --> 00:46:39.583
Oh yes, what a night indeed.

00:46:39.583 --> 00:46:40.625
Cool night.

00:46:42.625 --> 00:46:46.584
- Why don't they let him?
- What are we doing now?

00:46:46.584 --> 00:46:51.625
We took the longest and best
path.  Good for calf muscles, Vrede.

00:46:51.625 --> 00:46:53.626
Best night of my life.

00:46:54.584 --> 00:46:58.584
- Nice conversation.
- Very.  But we slipped.

00:46:58.626 --> 00:47:00.584
OK, hi.

00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:04.626
- This band is very good.
- Michigan has good taste.

00:47:06.626 --> 00:47:09.626
If we like the same things as
they do, we have enough friends.

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:13.585
- Good night.
- Yes, I also want to sleep now.

00:47:13.626 --> 00:47:18.585
There are lots of hours.  And you should have
some sleep before tomorrow's practice game.

00:47:18.585 --> 00:47:23.627
- We always have a practice match on the last day.
- This is how Val joined the team in his first year.

00:47:23.627 --> 00:47:28.585
Val scored two goals.  It was true
that no freshman had ever done it before.

00:47:28.627 --> 00:47:32.585
On paper, it's not a selection
until next year, but that's it.

00:47:32.627 --> 00:47:38.627
- You have to do well.  Be yourself.
- We can be Flamehawks tomorrow.

00:47:38.627 --> 00:47:41.628
How are we doing when
our new Self is not ready?

00:47:42.628 --> 00:47:46.586
You say something.  we have
to go down with these memories.

00:47:56.628 --> 00:47:58.628
Is that broccoli?

00:47:58.628 --> 00:48:02.587
- We'll go deeper.
- Well observed.

00:48:02.628 --> 00:48:06.587
The longest road is longer than
expected.  How about we sing for a while?

00:48:06.587 --> 00:48:10.587
- I know a song: "I surrender".
- We can also play silent games.

00:48:10.587 --> 00:48:11.629
One, two, three, calm down.

00:48:12.629 --> 00:48:16.629
- We went back and took him down...
- Get angry, not now.

00:48:16.629 --> 00:48:21.629
It didn't work.  The real Riley is
out there and we will never find him.

00:48:22.588 --> 00:48:24.588
I will find it.  I
just lack visibility.

00:48:39.588 --> 00:48:43.588
- OK, that won't work, fine enough.
- It's hopeless.

00:48:43.588 --> 00:48:48.630
- We have to drop it and come back.
- This is an increasingly blind road.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:53.631
Since the puberty alarm went
off, nothing here has worked!

00:48:53.631 --> 00:48:58.589
I can no longer recognize the
place.  Sunny at one in the morning!

00:48:58.589 --> 00:49:01.631
Never in my life have
I done so many jars.

00:49:01.631 --> 00:49:03.631
The Riley we know is gone!

00:49:03.631 --> 00:49:07.631
If Joy can't see that,
then it's self-deception.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:12.590
Self-deception?

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:14.590
Of course it's
just self-delusion!

00:49:14.631 --> 00:49:21.632
It takes desperately to maintain optimism, when all
there is is mumbling, mumbling, mumbling from you!

00:49:21.632 --> 00:49:23.632
For seven sour Sørensen lemons!

00:49:24.632 --> 00:49:28.590
Do you think I have all
the answers? Of course not!

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.591
We can't even find
it on our own Backhead.

00:49:37.632 --> 00:49:38.632
The fear is valid.

00:49:38.632 --> 00:49:43.633
Riley doesn't have much
need for us because he has it.

00:49:45.591 --> 00:49:49.591
And it hurts.  Really painful.

00:49:54.633 --> 00:49:58.592
The joy you have committed
to many mistakes.  Lots.

00:49:58.633 --> 00:50:01.633
And you will commit
even more in the future.

00:50:01.633 --> 00:50:06.592
But if you let mistakes stop you,
can we just lie down and give up.

00:50:06.592 --> 00:50:08.634
Sounds pretty good.

00:50:09.634 --> 00:50:10.634
Come on.

00:50:17.634 --> 00:50:20.634
- You can't use it!
- Riley Crisis.

00:50:20.634 --> 00:50:23.593
- Thank You.
- Get!

00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:40.593
- Forget it, it just happened.
- So agree.

00:50:45.635 --> 00:50:46.635
See.

00:50:50.594 --> 00:50:51.635
We are right behind you.

00:51:01.636 --> 00:51:03.636
Very good.  The flame
eagle has accepted us.

00:51:03.636 --> 00:51:06.636
But what's the point if
we don't make the team?

00:51:06.636 --> 00:51:10.595
- Tomorrow is very important.
- We have to get more help.

00:51:10.595 --> 00:51:12.595
- Ennui, are you listening?
- NO.

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:15.636
- Embarrassed?
- Nice conversation.

00:51:15.636 --> 00:51:19.637
- Very.  But we slipped.
- OK, hi.

00:51:30.595 --> 00:51:33.637
What am I looking for?

00:51:33.637 --> 00:51:37.637
Don't you just hate it when you
forget what you were going to do?

00:51:37.637 --> 00:51:40.637
- We need all the help we can get.
- Agreed.

00:51:52.638 --> 00:51:54.638
This is our life the
most important game.

00:52:04.638 --> 00:52:07.639
Good friend.  It was
going to be a long night.

00:52:09.639 --> 00:52:11.639
Now we are preparing the team.

00:52:13.472 --> 00:52:14.472
Already come!  We just
need to go through…

00:52:14.472 --> 00:52:16.431
Fantasy world

00:52:16.431 --> 00:52:19.431
Fantasy world! INSIDE
would love this!

00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:22.473
There's Pomfritskoven
and Skyby and...

00:52:24.473 --> 00:52:26.473
There's definitely
something going on here.

00:52:27.473 --> 00:52:31.473
- Mount Crushmore?
- Are these the four people he likes the most?

00:52:31.473 --> 00:52:35.473
- Only Lance is important.
- At least that's the bright side.

00:52:36.431 --> 00:52:40.473
- All sides are good sides.
- The rumors?

00:52:40.473 --> 00:52:45.432
- The best gossip magazine.
- Latest news!  Hot gossip from Ryugtemøllen!

00:52:45.473 --> 00:52:50.432
- "There is a jacuzzi in the teacher's room"?
- "Lucy from the math team is a psychic"?

00:52:50.432 --> 00:52:54.474
"Abbie R texts Mike T, but
Mike T bakes cakes at Sarah M"?

00:52:54.474 --> 00:52:57.474
- Where are their ethics?
- Pudehyggeborg is still here!

00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:59.474
It even got bigger.

00:53:01.474 --> 00:53:02.474
And orange?

00:53:06.474 --> 00:53:10.433
22: Riley breaks his leg and
disappoints the entire team.  Very good.

00:53:11.475 --> 00:53:14.475
18: Val and Dani whisper together, as
Riley misses a goal-scoring opportunity.

00:53:14.475 --> 00:53:16.475
We have to help Riley
by getting ready.

00:53:17.475 --> 00:53:20.475
Now we ship everything
that can go wrong.

00:53:20.475 --> 00:53:25.433
We think ahead.  On everything
he might have done wrong.

00:53:25.475 --> 00:53:29.475
Come on, 17. I don't
see anything from you.

00:53:32.475 --> 00:53:35.476
Riley missed a scoring
opportunity. Coach took note.

00:53:35.476 --> 00:53:37.434
More than that!

00:53:37.476 --> 00:53:40.476
Oh no.  They use Riley's
Imagination against him.

00:53:40.476 --> 00:53:44.476
Val and the others like us now,
but what if we don't make the team?

00:53:48.476 --> 00:53:49.476
We go to number three.

00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:52.476
Bree and Grace's team
won and we were laughed at.

00:53:52.476 --> 00:53:55.476
22. Val delivered
to us and we burned.

00:53:57.435 --> 00:54:01.477
He couldn't do that against
Riley!  We have to stop it.

00:54:02.477 --> 00:54:06.477
Beautiful, 37. Riley shoots
the puck in his own net.

00:54:06.477 --> 00:54:10.435
- Why did you draw a hippo?
- I'll draw Riley!

00:54:10.477 --> 00:54:13.435
- You forgot the ponytail.
- I like the ponytail.

00:54:14.436 --> 00:54:17.477
Riley scores a goal and everyone
hugs him?  81, that doesn't help.

00:54:17.519 --> 00:54:22.478
Riley's nail polish matches the game
jersey.  Everyone imitates his cool style.

00:54:22.478 --> 00:54:27.478
- Riley wears knee pads.
- We buy flowers for the losers.

00:54:27.478 --> 00:54:32.436
- What?  I can't always make a profit.
- I love it.

00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:36.478
Nail polish?  Knee pads? You
don't seem to understand the task.

00:54:36.478 --> 00:54:37.478
What...

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:46.437
- Who sent that screenplay to Riley?
- How could I possibly know?

00:54:48.437 --> 00:54:52.479
What happened?  Who sent
all this positive stuff...

00:54:53.479 --> 00:54:56.479
Joy.  I know you are there.

00:54:56.479 --> 00:54:59.479
- Is that him?
- Joy from Headquarters?

00:55:00.437 --> 00:55:01.479
The police thought
they were on their way.

00:55:03.438 --> 00:55:06.438
- We tried it.
- Don't listen to Fear.

00:55:06.438 --> 00:55:09.479
He uses a bad scenario
to change Riley.

00:55:09.479 --> 00:55:13.480
I did it for you.  So
Riley could be happier.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.438
If you want him to be happy,
will you stop torturing him.

00:55:18.438 --> 00:55:19.438
Who is with me?

00:55:22.438 --> 00:55:24.480
Seriously?  There isn't any?

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.480
- Sorry, Joy.
- Yes!  You're onto something, 87.

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.439
A cat.  Not very
clear, but good enough.

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.480
Who has anything?  Come on!

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.439
If Riley was better than
Val, Val would hate him.

00:55:36.481 --> 00:55:40.439
Or Riley is better than
Val, and Val respects him.

00:55:40.439 --> 00:55:41.481
Yes!  Like that!

00:55:42.481 --> 00:55:46.481
What if Riley is so bad he has to
stop playing ice hockey altogether?

00:55:46.481 --> 00:55:50.481
What if he plays, so his coach is
touched and he will go to the Olympics-

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.440
- and he achieved a home
victory to the joy of the nation?

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.440
Stay in the real
world for a moment.

00:55:57.523 --> 00:55:58.482
NO!

00:55:59.482 --> 00:56:03.482
Fear has chained you to the
table and made you draw nightmares!

00:56:03.482 --> 00:56:06.482
You don't need to do it
anymore find yourself in it!

00:56:06.482 --> 00:56:08.482
Put down the pencil!
Stop the scenario!

00:56:08.482 --> 00:56:11.440
- Hah!
- Now that's enough!

00:56:14.482 --> 00:56:16.482
- My scenario!
- Pillow fight!

00:56:19.482 --> 00:56:21.482
For Riley!

00:56:21.482 --> 00:56:23.483
We have to be prepared.

00:56:27.441 --> 00:56:28.441
NO!

00:56:30.483 --> 00:56:34.483
- OK, we should continue.
- Agreed.

00:56:34.483 --> 00:56:36.483
- Come on, bastard!
- NO.

00:56:40.483 --> 00:56:43.483
- Return!
- To the Possible Careers Parade!

00:56:47.484 --> 00:56:48.484
Grab a balloon!

00:56:48.484 --> 00:56:49.484
- Pastry chef!
- Underpaid!

00:56:49.484 --> 00:56:50.484
- Art teacher!
- Not appreciated!

00:56:51.484 --> 00:56:54.484
- Music ethnologist!
- Don't understand what it is.

00:56:54.484 --> 00:56:56.484
- Supreme Court Judge!
- Yes!

00:56:57.442 --> 00:56:59.442
Return!

00:56:59.442 --> 00:57:00.484
They escaped!

00:57:03.443 --> 00:57:06.484
Like!  Now Riley can sleep.

00:57:06.484 --> 00:57:08.484
I miss the jar!

00:57:08.484 --> 00:57:12.485
Joy doesn't understand.  Without a
scenario we are not prepared to face it.

00:57:12.485 --> 00:57:14.485
Tomorrow's match
is very important.

00:57:14.485 --> 00:57:19.443
Coaches turn us into Flamehawks
or condemn us to a lonely future.

00:57:19.443 --> 00:57:22.485
If only we knew what
the coach thought of us.

00:57:22.485 --> 00:57:25.485
- Notebook!
- Brilliant idea!

00:57:26.485 --> 00:57:27.485
It says all the coach's
thoughts about you.

00:57:29.485 --> 00:57:32.485
We snuck into his
office and read it.

00:57:36.444 --> 00:57:38.486
Come on, Riley.  Move your feet.

00:57:38.486 --> 00:57:41.486
- Is not it?
- Are we pushing it too hard?

00:57:41.486 --> 00:57:45.486
Read it visually in that notebook!
Then we know what we need to improve.

00:57:54.486 --> 00:57:56.486
Riley, no.

00:57:58.487 --> 00:58:00.487
Joy?  Come on in, Joy.

00:58:01.487 --> 00:58:05.487
Sad?  What is wrong? Why
did Riley wake up again?

00:58:05.487 --> 00:58:08.487
Anxiety causes Riley
to barge into the coach.

00:58:09.445 --> 00:58:13.487
- He knows better than that.
- Yes, when he regains his self-image.

00:58:13.487 --> 00:58:15.487
Sad, stop him.

00:58:15.487 --> 00:58:18.487
But don't stay trapped
in it.  Changed!

00:59:09.489 --> 00:59:11.448
No, Riley.

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:31.449
Why did he stop?

00:59:31.449 --> 00:59:34.491
Sad?  Ennui! Where's
your cell phone?

00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:39.491
My cell phone?  Where's that?  Seriously!
This is not the case.  No, no, no!

00:59:40.491 --> 00:59:42.491
He must be here
somewhere.  Find him.

00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:44.491
That's it, I got you!

01:00:00.492 --> 01:00:02.492
Sad...

01:00:02.492 --> 01:00:04.450
NO.

01:00:05.492 --> 01:00:08.492
It felt wrong that
Riley was hanging around.

01:00:08.492 --> 01:00:10.492
Riley wasn't like that.

01:00:10.492 --> 01:00:15.492
It's not about who Riley
is, but who she will become.

01:00:28.493 --> 01:00:29.493
Andersen: NOT READY YET

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:34.493
- "Not ready"?
- Has the choice been made?

01:00:34.493 --> 01:00:38.452
- Aren't we going to form a team?
- We have one more day.

01:00:38.452 --> 01:00:41.493
What we can do?
What will Val do?

01:00:41.493 --> 01:00:47.494
We have to make the coach change
his mind.  We need ideas.  Lots.

01:00:54.452 --> 01:00:57.494
Oh no.  This is brainstorming!

01:00:58.494 --> 01:00:59.494
Too close!

01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:03.494
Give you the puck?
Ruining another team?

01:01:07.494 --> 01:01:08.494
Yes!

01:01:10.495 --> 01:01:12.495
Bad ideas don't contact Riley.

01:01:14.495 --> 01:01:14.536
Joy!

01:01:16.495 --> 01:01:18.495
Destroy as many as possible!

01:01:20.495 --> 01:01:21.495
Joy!

01:01:27.495 --> 01:01:30.454
I caught the idea
I wish it was mine.

01:01:30.454 --> 01:01:34.496
NO!  None of them are
good enough!  Get more!

01:01:36.496 --> 01:01:37.496
Jump on the balloon!

01:01:42.496 --> 01:01:44.496
It's worse than broccoli!

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:49.538
Take ideas!

01:01:52.496 --> 01:01:57.496
- The ideas are too small.
- We need bigger ideas.

01:02:01.497 --> 01:02:03.455
This is our salvation!

01:02:08.497 --> 01:02:10.497
Clear?

01:02:17.456 --> 01:02:19.456
We need this idea!

01:02:19.456 --> 01:02:21.539
If Riley takes it between
them, something is wrong!

01:02:22.498 --> 01:02:24.498
The only way out is up.

01:02:39.498 --> 01:02:40.498
That is a good idea!

01:02:41.498 --> 01:02:42.498
I like that one.

01:02:44.498 --> 01:02:45.498
Oh no.

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:53.457
Hold me!  I mean!  Hold me!

01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:57.499
Scared, do you have a parachute?

01:02:57.499 --> 01:03:00.499
Yes, yes.  Why should
none of you be with him?

01:03:01.499 --> 01:03:05.499
- Solid ground!  And good landing.
- We did it!

01:03:05.499 --> 01:03:08.499
We did it!  Already come!
We're going to Baghovedet.

01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:11.500
You're done, Anxiety!

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:19.500
The coach was right.  Riley wasn't ready.
But we are very close to the new Riley.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:25.500
We missed it here.  We showed
them that we are fearless Flamehawks.

01:03:37.501 --> 01:03:38.501
Cherry sports drink

01:03:47.501 --> 01:03:51.501
- Finally we are one of them!
- What do you think, Triste?

01:03:51.501 --> 01:03:52.501
- I...
- Cold!

01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:57.460
- Red is really our color.
- Very pleasant!

01:04:02.502 --> 01:04:05.502
OK, that creates
jealousy.  Excuse me.

01:04:05.502 --> 01:04:07.502
They think cool is temperature.

01:04:08.502 --> 01:04:12.502
Hey, Michigan.  You're the one
riding on the red wave, right?

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:15.502
- We're coming in.
- I hope it's okay.

01:04:16.461 --> 01:04:20.502
I'm not a Flamehawk yet, but I just
want to match the rest of the team.

01:04:20.502 --> 01:04:25.503
- That's fine.  Did you sleep last night?
- No, not with today's big game!

01:04:25.503 --> 01:04:29.503
- Practice match?
- I said, you made him angry.

01:04:29.503 --> 01:04:31.503
You're in the zone, right?

01:04:31.503 --> 01:04:35.503
- Get ready to score.
- Overall!

01:04:35.503 --> 01:04:39.503
Val scored two goals in a practice match and
became a Flamehawk.  What's better than two?

01:04:40.503 --> 01:04:43.503
- Three!
- Three!  We said that at the same time.

01:04:43.503 --> 01:04:46.504
But how can we
score three goals?

01:04:46.504 --> 01:04:51.545
Riley just did it all.  And I think
this one is the icing on the cake.

01:04:55.504 --> 01:04:56.504
Moment.

01:05:00.962 --> 01:05:02.921
Come on!

01:05:02.921 --> 01:05:05.963
We are very close.
Self-concept above that bj...

01:05:10.963 --> 01:05:14.963
- There are some.
- I haven't sent back that much.

01:05:14.963 --> 01:05:19.963
- When he entered the glass doors at the party.
- And when he broke grandma's plate.

01:05:19.963 --> 01:05:23.922
Well, these memories
are not part of him.

01:05:37.964 --> 01:05:38.964
There it is!

01:05:44.964 --> 01:05:48.964
- I am a good person.
- Oh no.

01:05:59.007 --> 01:06:01.965
Yes.  Come on.

01:06:01.965 --> 01:06:03.965
Here he is!

01:06:04.965 --> 01:06:05.965
I'm not good enough.

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:11.924
- What?
- I'm not good enough.

01:06:12.924 --> 01:06:14.966
I'm not good enough.

01:06:16.966 --> 01:06:17.966
Are you sure...?

01:06:17.966 --> 01:06:20.966
He just knew that there was
still room for improvement.

01:06:20.966 --> 01:06:22.966
He is fine.

01:06:24.966 --> 01:06:26.924
Sadly, we have a
Self-Conception.

01:06:26.924 --> 01:06:28.966
Get us back.  sad,
can you hear us?

01:06:32.966 --> 01:06:34.966
I'm not good enough.

01:06:43.967 --> 01:06:47.967
I can fix it.  I had to
simply recalibrate the console.

01:06:47.967 --> 01:06:49.009
No more surprises.

01:06:50.009 --> 01:06:54.967
OK, it should be here, and it's
there.  And not quite there, but here.

01:06:54.967 --> 01:06:57.967
We're stepping it up a
bit here. Then fine tune.

01:06:57.967 --> 01:06:59.967
The person who was set
up was completely wrong.

01:06:59.967 --> 01:07:01.926
Sad, now!

01:07:12.968 --> 01:07:15.968
- Joy!
- Oh no!

01:07:33.969 --> 01:07:36.969
I am a good person.

01:07:36.969 --> 01:07:39.969
I'm not good enough.

01:07:42.969 --> 01:07:46.969
- It's the only way back.
- We are very close.

01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:56.970
Joy!

01:07:57.970 --> 01:07:59.970
Where are you going?

01:08:15.971 --> 01:08:17.971
28, Anderson.  Leg span.

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:22.971
28, Anderson.  Seatbelt!

01:08:29.013 --> 01:08:31.971
28, Anderson.  Seatbelt!

01:08:33.971 --> 01:08:35.971
I expected more from you, Riley.

01:08:38.972 --> 01:08:39.972
Not that...

01:08:46.013 --> 01:08:46.972
What...

01:08:53.972 --> 01:08:56.972
Come on.

01:08:57.972 --> 01:08:59.931
What am I not seeing?

01:09:04.973 --> 01:09:07.973
I am a good person.

01:09:14.973 --> 01:09:16.973
Joy.

01:09:16.973 --> 01:09:19.015
What are we doing now?

01:09:27.974 --> 01:09:28.974
I do not know.

01:09:30.974 --> 01:09:34.974
I don't know how
you stop Anxiety.

01:09:36.016 --> 01:09:39.974
Maybe we can't do it.

01:09:39.974 --> 01:09:43.974
Maybe it's always like
this when you get older.

01:09:43.974 --> 01:09:46.974
You feel less happy.

01:09:52.975 --> 01:09:54.975
But I am sure of one thing.

01:09:56.975 --> 01:10:02.975
Riley would never be himself if we didn't
bring him here to Headquarters.  Quickly.

01:10:04.933 --> 01:10:06.934
How?

01:10:09.975 --> 01:10:12.975
- Good fight, Riley.
- Thank you, and the same for you.

01:10:14.976 --> 01:10:16.976
I'm not good enough.

01:10:23.934 --> 01:10:25.018
Yes!  Come on, come on, come on!

01:10:25.976 --> 01:10:28.976
Riley, I'm free!  Deliver!

01:10:28.976 --> 01:10:31.976
I'm not good enough.

01:10:35.976 --> 01:10:38.977
- Well done, Michigan!
- Just save a little for all of us.

01:10:38.977 --> 01:10:41.018
Like!  The first of three goals.

01:10:41.977 --> 01:10:45.977
How do we get our
self-perception from here to there?

01:10:46.977 --> 01:10:50.977
I have an idea, but I
really don't like it.

01:10:50.977 --> 01:10:52.977
Angry, Riley needs us.

01:10:54.977 --> 01:10:57.977
Oh, the Bag!

01:10:59.977 --> 01:11:02.978
What are you waiting
for?  Now say the words!

01:11:02.978 --> 01:11:04.978
Oh, the Bag!

01:11:11.978 --> 01:11:14.020
Hi everybody.  I am the Bag!

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.978
- We know that well.
- We're going to Headquarters.

01:11:16.978 --> 01:11:19.978
- Do you have anything that can help us?
- I have a lot of things.

01:11:19.978 --> 01:11:22.978
What do you think is the best?

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:24.978
Rolls of tape, ducks...

01:11:24.978 --> 01:11:26.979
Continue!

01:11:28.979 --> 01:11:30.979
Seriously, Wallet?  Dynamite?

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.020
Don't you have one?
jetpack or plane?

01:11:34.979 --> 01:11:35.979
Do you think I have
everything here?

01:11:36.979 --> 01:11:38.979
I offer you a bath
duck and duct tape.

01:11:38.979 --> 01:11:42.979
Now I have it.  But we
have to use more dynamite.

01:11:42.979 --> 01:11:44.979
Do you know?  Good luck.

01:11:48.979 --> 01:11:50.980
Come on!  Take the puck!

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:51.980
Take!

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:54.980
I'm not good enough.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:00.938
What are you doing now?
We are on the same team!

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:08.980
Yes!

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.980
Dani might have been a little angry with us,
but everyone forgave us when we joined the team.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.981
Come on, Riley.  One more goal.

01:12:21.022 --> 01:12:23.981
Wait a minute, Joy.
Do we blow up the rock?

01:12:23.981 --> 01:12:28.981
And returning to Headquarters
amidst an avalanche of bad memories?

01:12:28.981 --> 01:12:31.981
How do we avoid these bad
memories creating bad values?

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:32.981
I do not know.

01:12:34.981 --> 01:12:36.981
What is wrong?  I join.

01:12:36.981 --> 01:12:38.982
- Ready?
- For Riley.

01:12:38.982 --> 01:12:41.982
- Now we do it.
- We're coming now, Riley.

01:12:55.024 --> 01:12:56.024
Jump!

01:13:20.983 --> 01:13:22.983
Come on!

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:24.983
Dirt!

01:13:25.983 --> 01:13:29.984
- I'm not good enough.
- You have to score!

01:13:38.984 --> 01:13:42.984
- Andersen, penalty box, two minutes.
- NO!

01:13:44.026 --> 01:13:45.984
Grace, are you okay?

01:13:49.984 --> 01:13:53.985
- We hurt Grace.
- It went very fast.  I do not see it.

01:13:59.985 --> 01:14:03.027
- I'm not good enough.
- What have I done?

01:14:05.027 --> 01:14:08.985
Oh no.  I fixed
that.  I'll fix it.

01:14:47.987 --> 01:14:51.029
I expected more from you, Riley.

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:52.029
NO!

01:14:53.987 --> 01:14:55.987
Already come.

01:14:55.987 --> 01:14:56.987
I'm not good enough.

01:14:57.987 --> 01:15:00.987
Come on, Riley.
Control yourself.

01:15:00.987 --> 01:15:02.988
Now control yourself.

01:15:02.988 --> 01:15:04.988
I'm not good enough.

01:15:04.988 --> 01:15:09.029
You have to score, Riley!
Otherwise, everything is in vain.

01:15:09.029 --> 01:15:11.988
Afraid, you pushed him too hard.

01:15:29.989 --> 01:15:31.989
OK, take a break!

01:15:42.031 --> 01:15:44.989
- Sad!
- Joy!  Help!

01:15:46.989 --> 01:15:47.989
We can handle it!

01:15:48.989 --> 01:15:51.990
- This won't work!
- That's fear.

01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:10.990
Scared, stop!

01:16:17.032 --> 01:16:19.991
You don't have to
decide who Riley is.

01:16:25.991 --> 01:16:26.991
Worry.

01:16:32.033 --> 01:16:33.991
You have to let it go.

01:16:57.992 --> 01:16:59.992
I am a good person.

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:13.993
Joy.  Excuse me.

01:17:15.993 --> 01:17:17.993
I just tried to protect him.

01:17:19.993 --> 01:17:25.993
But you're right.  We don't
need to determine who Riley is.

01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:34.994
We keep the best and
throw away the worst!

01:17:46.994 --> 01:17:48.994
28, Anderson.  Seatbelt!

01:18:12.995 --> 01:18:14.996
I am a good person.

01:18:21.996 --> 01:18:22.996
What are you doing now?

01:18:34.996 --> 01:18:36.996
I'm selfish.

01:18:36.996 --> 01:18:38.997
I'm kind.

01:18:39.997 --> 01:18:41.997
I'm not good enough.

01:18:42.955 --> 01:18:44.997
I am a good person.

01:18:44.997 --> 01:18:48.997
I have to adapt but
I want to be myself.

01:18:48.997 --> 01:18:50.997
I'm brave, but I feel scared.

01:18:51.039 --> 01:18:54.997
Success means everything.  I
committed error.  I'm funny.  I was led.

01:18:54.997 --> 01:18:58.997
I am a good friend.  I am a bad
friend. I am strong.  I am weak.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Riley, are you okay?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.042
Yes.  I mean: no.

01:20:16.001 --> 01:20:18.001
I really pity you.

01:20:19.001 --> 01:20:25.043
When you said you were going to
the second school, I panicked.  And...

01:20:28.001 --> 01:20:30.001
I am so sorry.

01:20:31.043 --> 01:20:35.001
If you no longer
want to be friends...

01:20:35.001 --> 01:20:37.001
... I understand it well.

01:20:37.001 --> 01:20:40.002
But I hope that
you can forgive me.

01:20:42.002 --> 01:20:43.043
One day.

01:21:10.003 --> 01:21:14.045
- Come on, ladies!
- We have to finish the game.

01:21:42.004 --> 01:21:46.004
Joy.  Riley wants you.

01:22:21.047 --> 01:22:22.047
Riley!

01:23:06.008 --> 01:23:08.008
Yes!

01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:32.009
Minnesota, your eyes
are glued to the screen.

01:23:32.009 --> 01:23:35.009
It's almost two o'clock.
Coach will post the list soon.

01:23:35.009 --> 01:23:37.009
- Two o'clock.  He...
- In six minutes.

01:23:38.009 --> 01:23:42.009
So what if we don't become one
fire Eagle?  Thanks for asking.

01:23:42.009 --> 01:23:44.051
Mom and Dad will
be disappointed.

01:23:44.051 --> 01:23:47.051
We will not be ice hockey
players, but musical ethnologists.

01:23:47.051 --> 01:23:54.010
- We have no friends and die alone.
- Calm.  None of that is happening right now, is it?

01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:57.010
Cold!  Then we sat down
in our very special chairs.

01:23:57.010 --> 01:24:01.052
- Yes, that's a good idea.
- Isn't it better now?

01:24:01.052 --> 01:24:04.010
Yes, that's the problem.

01:24:04.052 --> 01:24:09.010
We can't control whether Riley
joins the team.  What can we control?

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.010
Riley has a Spanish test
tomorrow.  We have to go.

01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:14.010
- Yes, we really have it...
- Olvidamos!

01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:15.011
- What does it mean?
- "Forget".

01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:18.052
- Great from the start!
- I never thought about that.

01:24:19.011 --> 01:24:20.011
Thank you friends.

01:24:20.011 --> 01:24:23.011
And we have followed along well
throughout the elite training.

01:24:23.053 --> 01:24:28.011
- I'm the only one who thinks about it.
- That's your idea!

01:24:28.011 --> 01:24:32.011
- I envy myself.  Thank You.
- You're welcome!

01:24:32.011 --> 01:24:36.053
- Who said that?
- My new friend, Taskesen.

01:24:36.053 --> 01:24:40.012
- Confetti if we make a team.
- Great idea.

01:24:40.012 --> 01:24:42.012
No matter what,
we love our girls.

01:24:42.012 --> 01:24:45.012
Confetti if not!

01:24:47.012 --> 01:24:50.012
- Is that an email from the coach?
- No, from Bree and Grace.

01:24:50.012 --> 01:24:51.054
Good luck!!

01:24:52.012 --> 01:24:54.012
I miss those girls.

01:24:54.012 --> 01:24:59.012
- Do you remember when Bree, Grace, and us...
- It was too early!

01:24:59.012 --> 01:25:01.012
Then I'll just wait downstairs.

01:25:02.012 --> 01:25:04.013
It's three minutes.
You two.  He succeeded.

01:25:04.013 --> 01:25:08.054
Because he owns
us! Yes!  Correct?

01:25:09.013 --> 01:25:13.013
- Because he... Maybe?
- Well done, Flove!

01:25:13.013 --> 01:25:15.013
Just look at Flove!

01:25:17.013 --> 01:25:20.013
If it doesn't work out this
year, maybe do it next year.

01:25:20.013 --> 01:25:23.013
- Yes.
- I like our girl.

01:25:23.013 --> 01:25:27.055
- Can you do something else?  He is very fast.
- And good at ice hockey.

01:25:28.014 --> 01:25:31.055
- He's creative.
- He can bore us, but never boring.

01:25:31.055 --> 01:25:34.014
He could now be a
little sarcastic.

01:25:34.014 --> 01:25:37.014
He can have real bad ideas.

01:25:37.014 --> 01:25:40.014
Sometimes it is true
that something is wrong.

01:25:40.014 --> 01:25:44.014
And sometimes he is
too hard on himself.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:47.014
But all of Riley's
pages shape who he is.

01:25:47.056 --> 01:25:49.014
And we love everything
about our girl.

01:25:51.015 --> 01:25:55.015
Each one is messy,
on the beautiful side.

01:26:03.648 --> 01:26:07.121
OK, Secret Deep Darkness.
The time has come.

01:26:09.131 --> 01:26:12.440
It doesn't matter.
Come out with you.

01:26:12.568 --> 01:26:18.741
Okay.  just get out there,
mate.  What's the secret?

01:26:20.853 --> 01:26:24.638
- We make holes in the carpet.
- Is that all?

01:26:24.766 --> 01:26:30.425
I think we peed in
the pool.  No, wait.

01:26:32.422 --> 01:26:33.525
And he left.

01:26:50.933 --> 01:26:53.933
Riley how did he go to camp?

01:26:53.933 --> 01:26:56.933
We have agreed that
we tell them everything.

01:26:58.975 --> 01:27:03.933
- Also we sneak into the office?
- And Grace's tough tackle?

01:27:03.933 --> 01:27:05.933
- Protest.
- Excuse me.  Excuse me.

01:27:06.933 --> 01:27:08.933
It went well.

01:27:09.933 --> 01:27:12.933
He's gone for three days,
and we only get "fine"?

01:27:12.933 --> 01:27:15.975
What does the red number
mean, is he a gang member?

01:27:15.975 --> 01:27:16.975
Welcome back, Angst.

01:27:18.975 --> 01:27:22.934
He's gone for three days,
and we only get "fine"?

01:27:22.976 --> 01:27:25.934
This might cover it
well. Back to the fight.

01:27:25.934 --> 01:27:28.934
Nice pass to Reeves,
and then down the middle.

01:27:29.934 --> 01:27:31.976
To the limit. What a brazen act!
