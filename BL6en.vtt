00:29.550 --> 00:30.800
<b>All right.</b>

00:31.770 --> 00:37.140
<b>Our star player, Sendou, and your 
violent plus-one got into another fight.</b>

00:37.390 --> 00:39.750
<b>Seems they just can't get along.</b>

00:39.750 --> 00:40.720
<b>Don't care.</b>

00:41.040 --> 00:44.310
<b>Just kick that garbage "star player"
 of yours off the team.</b>

00:44.310 --> 00:51.380
<b>Nah, he may be garbage to you, 
but to us, he's our star player.</b>

00:53.050 --> 00:59.260
<b>So a lot of our players are saying
if Sendou's left out, they won't play.</b>

01:00.340 --> 01:04.500
<b>At this rate, the match will be boycotted 
due to too many players withdrawing.</b>

01:04.500 --> 01:08.360
<b>Still not gonna change 
your mind, Li'l Genius?</b>

01:09.510 --> 01:10.750
<b>Is that a threat?</b>

01:10.750 --> 01:11.670
<b>Not at all.</b>

01:12.150 --> 01:15.580
<b>I don't think anyone wants 
to see the match canceled.</b>

01:15.580 --> 01:20.550
<b>You're the crowd-pulling panda here, 
so I'm trying to be nice to you.</b>

01:21.990 --> 01:23.560
<b>So what do you want?</b>

01:23.850 --> 01:26.670
<b>Let us win without Shidou.</b>

01:27.880 --> 01:30.430
<b>Should be easy for 
a genius like you, right?</b>

01:31.590 --> 01:33.790
<b>Is that the consensus of the team?</b>

01:34.140 --> 01:37.580
<b>Or did the JFU geezers put you up to it?</b>

01:37.580 --> 01:49.290
<b>Well, 99% of it is my selfish side wanting 
to know what you can bring to the table.</b>

01:50.620 --> 01:54.640
<b>And the remaining 1% is 
because it's my job as captain.</b>

01:55.030 --> 01:58.220
<b>I don't like money-grabbing adults, either.</b>

02:00.180 --> 02:02.060
<b>You're one self-serving captain.</b>

02:03.240 --> 02:07.060
<b>Interesting idea. Okay, I'll take the bait.</b>

02:07.060 --> 02:10.650
<b>You will? Thanks. 
You're more amiable than I thought.</b>

02:15.230 --> 02:16.930
<b>Don't get the wrong idea.</b>

02:17.380 --> 02:19.700
<b>I'll be the one testing you.</b>

02:20.030 --> 02:23.360
<b>If you can't keep up with me, I'm out.</b>

04:46.320 --> 04:48.280
<b><i>The "where" and "who" didn't matter.</i></b>

05:13.700 --> 05:17.670
<b><i>The previous 15 days of training 
had helped me to think that way.</i></b>

05:22.210 --> 05:26.760
<b><i>Mostly because we'd trained 
with a strong sense of purpose.</i></b>

05:32.080 --> 05:37.840
